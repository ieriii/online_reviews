Oh La Pasadita. Where the steak tacos taste like a steak dinner. One taco is equal to two normal tacos, but feel free to pay a dollar more for a super taco. You've got 3 choices for burritos: There's a regular one bigger than a Chipotle burrito, a super burrito that is almost twice that size, and the ultimate burrito (twice the super) for when you feel like eating 4 burritos in one. You've got 3 choices for restaurants: the main one at this location which is full size and full menu. There's another location 2 doors down with burritos and tacos. Across the street from that one there's a third location that only sells tacos. You must go here.
