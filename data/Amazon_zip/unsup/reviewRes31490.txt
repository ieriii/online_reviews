This place would definitely get 5 stars from me if this rating was just based on food. They have an incredible selection of all vegetarian/mostly vegan food. I went here with my family on my birthday and everyone liked their food. Did I mention that 5 out of the 7 of my guests are die hard carnivores? Yeah, even they enjoyed it! There is something for everyone on the menu. The only less than stellar thing I have to say about the place is that it is TINY... which means you have to wait to sit down for quite awhile sometimes... and the waiting area is pretty much in the doorway or outside... and boy does it get cold in Chicago during the winter months!
