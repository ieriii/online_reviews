Awesome food. The food here is really good and very authentic. There are 3 of them within the span of a block, but my favorite is the southernmost one on the west side of Ashland. I've only had the burritos and quesadillas and they were soooo good, I'm craving them right now. I remembered seeing it on Check Please and stopped there once while running errands; I now make special trips just to get my mexican fix. In addition to being awesome, the food is reasonably priced.
