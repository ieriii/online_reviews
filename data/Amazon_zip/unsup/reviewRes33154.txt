I love this place. It's cheap and you get a good amount of food. I feel like I could always eat more shawarma but the hummus and pita they give you fills in the cracks. I heard they're lamb shawarma was good but actually in going there several times I found it kind of tough. Chicken shawarma is the way to go.
