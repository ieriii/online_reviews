This is a must do - if you can get the reservation. Took about a year from my first phone call to dinner - just stay with it - it is worth the effort. Great, innovative food served in a relaxed and comfortable environment. A total of six employees on Saturday night - five of the six served us, the sixth appeared to wash dishes. We enjoyed the nine course menu and four days later I still can't pick my favorite of the ten courses served. Quail egg ravioli, "Biscuits and Gravy" , pork collar, ... all were beautifully prepared and unique. My mouth is watering . BYOB adds to the beauty, but keep your wine light and food friendly. No heavy reds should interfere with these flavors. Enjoy!
