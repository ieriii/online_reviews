They have the best Korean wings in Chicago. The Buddha bowls are also the bomb. It is hard to find parking for this restaurant, so your best bet is to catch public transportation. Everything is cooked to order and they also have healthy foods, IE. brown rice and fresh vegetables. The Big Boy Buddha bowl is big enough to share and the fried wings are huge. Six wings and a small Buddha bowl is enough for a date of two. They serve healthy drinks and well as regular sodas.
