I have never been to Costa Rica but if the food here is this good than I need to visit. This place was scrumptious. From the potato tacos, yuca with garlic oil and then the steak burrito. Wanna try a different kind of shake? then try the blackberry, it's different.If your in the mood to try a different kind of food meaning other than the typical, chinese, mexican or indian, (you get what i'm saying?) then try Irazu
