I have officially made Wishbone my Sunday morning breakfast spot! The food is delicious.....they give you great portions and are excellent on the coffee refills! I normally go with the french toast and bacon, OR the eggs and bacon and potatoes! Um, with your potatoes....you get an individual "side cup" of ketchup! AWESOME! Then just dip your potatoes in it while on the fork! Love it! no need for ketchup all over your plate! Service has always been good......always friendly! If you are going on a Sunday morning you will see that about 85% of the tables in front have baby's at them......not bad, just what I have seen!! And the lines and wait is long if you get there past 10:00am! That's why I am always up and early and off I go to Wishbone! Do try!
