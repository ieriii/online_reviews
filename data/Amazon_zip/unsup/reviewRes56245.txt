I have worked in the restaurant business for ten years and have never written a review on Yelp. I have never written a review on anything for that matter. I have been to Simply It twice now and it is amazing. Great service, BYOB and most importantly the food is amazing. i have tried a majority of the menu, because I was with large parties both times, and everything is great. I have worked with some of the finest Chefs in Chicago and dined at some of the finest restaurants. Simply It is a place that you must at least try. I think any of the dishes will be to your liking but the Lemongrass Chicken(hot), Mango Beef in a Coconut, and Calamari in a Pineapple are amazing in flavor and presentation. The price is very cheap as well. Try it and you will not be disappointed, I can assure you.
