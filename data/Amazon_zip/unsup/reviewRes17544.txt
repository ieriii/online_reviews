Carnivale has been a favorite of mine since my first encounter with the skirt steak! Although, this may seem a bit boring to order from a menu with so many things to choose from, it still stands #1 in my book! The steak, sauce, onions, rice and beans make the perfect lunch or dinner entree. You can't complain about the sangria either! TASTY! Not only does this restaurant provide you with good food but the ambiance and decor is wonderful. Talk about colorful!  The great food and environment had me thinking, What an awesome place for my rehearsal dinner! And we did just that. With many different rooms to choose from we had our rehearsal dinner in the Tango Room and everything went off without a hitch! I can't say enough good things about this place. JUST GO! TRY. LOVE!
