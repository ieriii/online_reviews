If I made a list of 20 things I appreciate in a restaurant, most likely I'd have 20 checkmarks on that list when thinking about Bonsoiree. I love the idea of a chef who is engaged with his/her customers and uses only the freshest ingredients available each time you come for a visit. I love a cozy intimate dining experience where you're not screaming to hear your dinner guest(s). I love restaurants within walking distance of my house. I love when I can honestly say the salad was the best thing I ate all night, in a good way. I love BYOB!! It may seem expensive to dine here, but it's quite honestly a great value considering the care and personal attention to detail Chef Shin brings to your food. I fancy myself a culinary enthusiast and I feel like a 5th grader playing horse with MJ when I'm eating at this place. Break out one of your good bottles and try this place early on a weekend night. It will probably be one of the best meals you have all year.
