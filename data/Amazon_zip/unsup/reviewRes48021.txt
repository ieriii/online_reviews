Tonight was my first and last time at the Publican. If you want to go for drinks, enjoy. If you want to go for quality food, run to your nearest KFC and pick up a bucket of original recipe, it will taste better than 90% of the food at this establishment. The spice of the day is salt, salt and more salt. Every dish we were served clearly had generous amount of salt added to it. We had to choke down our food and no one at our table was asking for seconds. The beers are great; the dining experience is pure bottom shelf.
