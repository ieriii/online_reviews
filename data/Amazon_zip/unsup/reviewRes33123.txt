I got the Blue cheese bacon spinach tomato frittata. I am not a big raw tomato fan. So I asked if they were cut large or small. He assured me that they were diced and cooked. Everything was good except the tomatoes which were hardly cooked(enough for me). So I picked around them.  He enjoyed his Eggs Benedict. Was a nice place.
