We are "foodies" and have been all around the world (including Italy twice) and this was one of the best meals we've ever eaten. The tuna and beans bruschetta was amazing. Anchovies and celery: molto buon! The chocolate mousse dessert: outstanding. Excellent service (Anna) and great atmosphere. And the price was very reasonable.
