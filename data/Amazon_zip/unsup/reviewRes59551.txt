yes! yes! yes! we ordered 2 orders of the kalbi, this way, we can grill it ourselves in the middle of the table, that stuff is way good. i have had a lot of korean bbq but the kalbi here when you can grill it yourself is absolutely killer. all the little dishes they give you with it are adventurous, if you are afraid to eat authentic korean, it may not be for you, but i love it!!
