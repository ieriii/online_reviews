This is my first restaurant review and it's too bad that it's a negative one. We came here 7/21 for our anniversary. Setting: The patio is really nice and impressive. I wish there were more places like this in the city. Food: The food was OK which was such a disappointment since we had a hard time choosing what we wanted because everything on the menu seemed really good. We tried the Frutti di mare which failed miserably. The juices from the shells of the mussels and clams dripped all over the sauce and made the pieces awkward to eat as well as messed with the flavor of the pizza. The pasta dish, Pacceri di 'Ciro', that my girlfriend ordered was, served with monk fish that night, smelled and tasted so ridiculously fishy that we had to send this back. I'm really surprised it even made it to our table because of the smell. The Malfatti ai Funghi Misti which replaced the Pacceri I would recommend. I had a tasting portion of the Lasagna, which turned out really good because of the bchamel, and the Battuta di Pollo, which was OK since the chicken was too salty to even enjoy the goat cheese. Service: Our waiter was very attentive the entire night, but I was really disappointed with the manager. The time we sent back the Pacceri, the manager didn't even acknowledge our issue nor apologized for the dish even though he was clearly standing right next to us listening. To top it off, they didn't even consider giving my gf anything like a piece of bread to help with the wait. All in all a so so dinner experience. Sorry, but it's a lousy 2 star for my first restaurant review.
