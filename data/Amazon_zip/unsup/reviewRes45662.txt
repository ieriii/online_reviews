I looove Wilde. The food is super super delicious which offers a pretty extensive menu. Good beer selection and very comfortable atmosphere always make me want to return. Great care was taken to decorate. The 2 best parts.... the bathroom (subway tile and fancy modern sinks) and ornate wood bar with built-in wall mirrors. Gorgeous!
