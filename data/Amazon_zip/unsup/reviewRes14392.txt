I've only been here for brunch, but I really liked everything I've tried so far. Which is: the veggie scramble, breakfast pizza, pork sandwich, and the snausage breakfast combo. AND they serve their bloodies with a nice wedge of cheddar (i think) cheese. A great place for brunch, and as soon as I'm off of my funemployment streak I'll try out their dinner.
