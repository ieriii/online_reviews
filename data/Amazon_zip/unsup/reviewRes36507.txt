Whenever I am near Greektown around brunchtime I make it a point to eat here. The omelets are Fantastic, the burger was good, the hashbrowns were good and the corn beef was AWESOME! The presentation is unusually nice for a breakfast/lunch place and the menu is filled with DELICIOUSNESS!!! I enjoyed the staff. They were friendly, well versed about the menu and fast. What more could I ask for... Seating is tight and the place is always jam packed, however its worth it IMO.
