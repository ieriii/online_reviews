All I can say after visiting Nuevo Leon is that I was pleasantly full when I left. Every item I tasted here was addicting. Seriously, as soon as I sat down to the table there was a basket of home made tortilla chips which I could not stop eating, they were that delicious. Speaking of the chips, the nachos were amazing! Every chip was individually topped with cheese, beans, sour cream and guacamole. Words alone can not describe how tasty these nachos were. As for my main course I had one of there steak dishes which again was probably one of the best authentic Mexican dishes I have had in the Chicago Area. (The homemade tortilla shells that came with my meal.....all I can say is.....AWESOME!) Nuevo Leon is moderate in price and is a BYOB establishment. I very much recommend bringing some Corona's which would definitely be a nice compliment drink to the food. The only regrets I have is that I did not save any room for the desert. I caught a glimpse of the three milk cake which according to other yelper's have said it is delicious.
