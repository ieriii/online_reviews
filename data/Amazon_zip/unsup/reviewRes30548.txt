Great little place. I started with an Old Fashioned muddled with Almonds, Cherries, and Figs (Awesome!). I had the meatball appetizer, which was very tasty, but the meatballs were a bit over-cooked and a little dry. That is why I gave it 4-stars instead of 5. Finally, I had the the grilled shrimp and fried oyster Po'boy. It was phenomenal. By far the best Po'boy I've ever had. I think I would have to get it every time. Service was great. It is a bit tough to get to from the city cause it's in Bridgeport. Plan ahead for a cab back to the city. Tell your waitress about halfway through your meal because my cab on a Friday night took 45 minutes. Apparently, it was because the first cab picked up someone else outside.
