The hotel has a beautiful lobby. Very large. I think the ceilings in the lobby were at least 3 stories tall. Wonderful architecture. Very classy. Now to the rooms. I had a King room that I booked on Priceline. You don't get to select the type of room on priceline like you do on expedia, orbiz, or any other travel site, so I had to call to make sure I had a King room. I was also told by a friend to ask for the more renevated room, which I was able to get, (I guess). The room was very very small. the bed was about 6 or 7 feet from the door. The room had a desk and a chair, but no extra comfy chair. No dresser to store my clothing. The ice bucket and two glasses were stored in the closet because there was no room to put it. The flat screen tv was mounted on the wall but a whole in the wall where the cable comes from was right in the middle of the wall (tacky) including all the wires to the tv halfway hanging down from the tv. (tacky again). The bathroom was ok, small but ok.   I order room service, a $12 cheeseburger and soda turned out to be $32 after state tax, city tax, room service fee, 18% gratuity for room service orders. And the guy acted like he wanted a tip when he brought in the tray. Seriously?? A soda in the vending machine was $2.50 and so was bottled water. Luckily there was a 7-elevan down the street for my late night cravings.   I put the do not disturb sign on the door because I wanted to sleep in late that next saturday morning. At 8am I am waken up by vacuuming by my door. Mind you the bed is close to the door. I felt like I was being punked. I guess do not disturb in only to keep the maids from knocking on your door. They didnt finish vacuuming the long azz hallway til and hour and a half later.   There was no view from my window, only the back fire escape and the building next to me.   I would never stay at this hotel or suggest anyone stay here.
