I had dinner at Kinzie Chop House the other night and, wow, what a great time! We arrived a few minutes early for our reservation and the hostess greeted us with a smile and suggested that we start out in the bar area because there was a little bit of a wait. I could tell this was a popular place. We had a great time in the bar and Dan, the bartender, entertained us. They came to seat us at our table and carried our drinks into the dining room. The steaks, the wine, the chocolate cake, everything was fabulous. And service was superb. We will definitely be back!
