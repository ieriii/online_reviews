Went here on a Sat afternoon at 4pm and it was crowded. I've been here a few times on the weekend and it was always packed. The food was excellent but the service was lacking, The waiter was nice but we did not see him too much. We started off with a popcorn, bacon and arugula appetizer. Everything was fried and was greasy good. I got the bacon cheeseburger on a barley roll( I think it was barley), The burger was cooked perfectly, it was juicy and tasted like beef. The burger was not tightly packed, it was great. I think that it at the top of my burger list along with Kuma's and Burger Bar. The fresh cut fries were a little soggy but had good flavor. Tj had the pork belly sandwich with a little arugula on a bun. It was a tasty,crispy slab of fat. The buns were a nice change of pace from the ever popular pretzel bun. The burgers are 11.00 buck apiece but are huge. They also have a good selection of beer including their own brews.If there service was not so slow it would be 5 stars.
