The sushi here is very good and it's CHEAP! My friends and I come here all the time and we are always in shock by how cheap the bill is, but maybe that's because we are bringing our own wine. I think I've tried every roll on the menu and I don't have a bad thing to say about Coast. It does get crowded so make reservatations beforehand or go very early.
