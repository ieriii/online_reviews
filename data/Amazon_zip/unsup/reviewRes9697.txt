I had been dying to try Sprout for months. I had the scallop, steak and corn for my dishes. The corn dish was one of the most creative, original dishes I have ever had. The steak was cooked perfectly medium rare and the scallop was delicious. The grilled cheese course was also fabulous. However, I have had food this good for half the price. I know we were paying for the celebrity chef's restaurant, but if I have to shell out $200 bucks for dinner, I will probably only do it once a year.
