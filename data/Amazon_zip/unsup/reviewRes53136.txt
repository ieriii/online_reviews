We love this place! The food is great (and very authentic), the prices are more than reasonable, the seating is usually ample and comfortable, and we leave full and happy. The owner is often around, milling about and making sure that everyone is happy. He is the nicest guy, and obviously the restaurant is a labor of love for him. The empanadas, churrasco, and ropa vieja are all delicious. Good Cuban music playing, not too loud, not too soft, makes you forget that you're in Chicago. If this place were around the corner, we'd go once a week!
