If only the service were more attentive and you would actually get acknowledged when you walk in this place, I think I would make it a point to come here more. I mean, meatfest on a grill? Plus seafood pancakes and white rice and bibimbop? Yes, please! Who cares if you walk out of here smelling like a kbbq skewer?
