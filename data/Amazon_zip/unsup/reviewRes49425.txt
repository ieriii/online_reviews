Not much to add here as the consensus is quite clear: Great steakhouse. I came here with three friends on a celebratory occasion, and none of them had ever been. I warned them about the large portions and good cocktails. We decided then to have a couple of those cocktails each, and to skip the appetizers, and focus our Friday evening hunger on those generous sizzling plates of grilled shrimp, steak and chicken. Accompanied by two different salsas verdes. One spicy, one not. both very woodsy and refreshing as accompaniments to the grilled meats. The margaritas and the mojitos were extraordinarily refreshing, too. Yucca, potato, and plantains, too. We shared a flan and figs with caramel. Creamiest flan ever! All of the grilled items were flavorful, cooked to perfection and the steaks were like "butta." We all agreed on that. Service was a little "meh," from the standpoint of our having to summon our server on a number of occasions, for various reasons. But the dinners did come out quickly enough. The service just lacked that usual ubiquitous Latin warmth and "Mi casa es su casa" approach. But I know we will all be back again in heartbeat. Authentic, delicious and a great value for a steakhouse.
