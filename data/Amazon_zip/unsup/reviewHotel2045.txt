I had my wedding here and it was AMAZING! Everything from the moment I viewed the space through writing the last check was a fantastic experience. Barbara Martin is incredible. She is so calm, professional, attentive, and relaxed me whenever I spoke with her. The food is great, and the view from the ballroom takes your breath away! I had a 5:00 November wedding ceremony and reception here and everyone could not stop talking about how fabulous it was. I was so happy I decided to get married here. The Cityscape bar is great, great views too. You can go straight to the merchandise mart and never go outside, which is great for elderly guests and also makes for great pictures. AND the Bridal Suite is soooooo cool. It's two stories and has spiral staircase. I felt so special all weekend. I can't gush enough about how fantastic, incredible, and special my wedding weekend here was! You will not regret working with Barbara and the Holiday Inn for your event!
