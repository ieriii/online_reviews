I love Mexican Food. This place is amazing. I've been coming here for a really long time but I wanted to wait to review it until after I had just visited. I went back again yesterday and just finished my left-overs. Yummy. It's always moderately to really busy but it's a really big place so the wait is always very short to nonexistent. The wait staff is very quick and friendly. Your meal always starts with freshly made chips and delicious salsa, and more importantly, a free appetizer. Usually a sopa, but yesterday some sort of pork and beans dish. I love the spicy salsa verde, SO good. I get something different almost every time I come. The quesadillas are great, the nachos are awesome, the tacos yum and the burrito oh my god. But I think yesterday I found my new regular dish. I don't know why I've never had the tamales before but they were FANTASTIC. They tastes the like the fresh homemade tamales my childhood best friends grandmother used to make us, I swear, they are way better than tamale man, they are so good. They keep well too, you get four and I could only finish two with everything else they give you. The food is really cheap, like $20 (including a $5 tip because the service is awesome) for dinner for two. AND it's BYOB. Srsly, go here, as often as you can.
