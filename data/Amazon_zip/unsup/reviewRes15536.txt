Bartenders are super helpful when it comes to finding a beer you'll enjoy - I love that. I'm usually not a "fancy" beer drinker, so I have a hard time at breweries like this. The bartender listened to what I like and gave me two samples to choose from. He was dead on and I loved the beer I ordered! Bacon fat popcorn is of course a huge hit - my boyfriend loves anything with bacon. The burgers are great - I ended up bringing half of mine home, though - they're pretty big! Love the decor and the atmosphere, too. We've already been back twice!
