I love this place. It's not fancy, but the food is carefully prepared and has interesting flavor combinations. However, please know that I'm writing this review as someone new to the trendy world of crepes. I'm not saying this restaurant is trendy, but for me, part of my fascination with Icosium Kafe is that they can make savory dishes. With crepes. That's weird! And tasty! Maybe someone more familiar with the diversity of crepes wouldn't be that impressed. That said, I hearted (yes, that's what I said) the savory crepes we had for lunch. Delicious combinations, in a light, chewy yet fluffy crepe dough. Wonderful. Their soups were surprisingly interesting, in a good way. Enjoyed everything about this place, except where our table was placed. I'm writing this review about four months after we actually ate there. We were there in December, and we had a table near the door -- the door that never fully shut. So we were continually cold.
