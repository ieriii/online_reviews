Nose to tail menu. Ran across it while visiting the magnificent mile. A sign out front promised "wine, swine and cheese". Swine, who says swine? I hoped for odd piggy parts and was not disappointed. It wasn't too busy as it was an odd hour, 3.30 on a Thursday. Skip the meatball sliders, don't waste your appetite on such a mundane offering. Go straight to the crispy fried pork jowl resting on sauteed mushrooms sitting on a crusty sliced bread and topped with a duck egg. It's a rare find to have sweetbreads, tail and ear on a menu. "I'll eat anything if it's prepared well" and here, it's prepared very well.
