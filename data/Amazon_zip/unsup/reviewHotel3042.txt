It is dark in the hallways, dark in the rooms. I understand the point of trying to be trendy, but I kind of like the idea of seeing if the room is clean or not. This former Days Inn, next to a construction site for the next year btw, has small rooms and a bar that pretends to be trendy. W was hot in the early part of this century, but seems more vegas than anything else. Too many other hotels in Chicago that are better than this one.
