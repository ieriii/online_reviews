My friends and I had a great experience at big jones! I love how they bring out beignets instead of bread... SOoOoO yummy. My friend ordered the crab cakes benedicts. We all tried it and thought it was super delicious. I got shrimp and grits, which was also super good-- but um, it was a little small for my tastes. I ate the whole thing! I like taking leftovers... My other friend got a pork sandwich which was also delightfully yummy.  Then, we all split the red velvet cake which was super good... however, not nearly as good as I thought it'd be. My friend who's had it before thinks they may have changed it, because it wasn't as good ??? If that's true, change it back! I want the super good one :)
