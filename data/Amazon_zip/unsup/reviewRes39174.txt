Walked in with semi high expectations after seeing the reviews from Yelp and walked out happy and full :) A group of four shared the meatballs, sloppy joes, beef tongue, scallops, and pork belly. The pork belly was a unanimous favorite. Perfectly cooked pork belly (crispy on the outside and tender in the inside) with risotto that perfectly complimented each other. I was scared to order the pork belly because at most places its too salty... but that wasn't the case at Longman & Eagle. The meatballs was also a favorite of mine. Although, I wish they gave you four instead of three... one more ball can't cost that much more right? The the hint of spice from the meatballs and the creamy polenta balanced each other just right. The scallops were seared to perfection and just melted in my mouth. Its funny how a lot of restaurants can screw this up. The sloppy joes and beef tongue were good but I didn't have a ratatouille moment. Definitely worth coming back as their menu changes with the season. Enjoy!
