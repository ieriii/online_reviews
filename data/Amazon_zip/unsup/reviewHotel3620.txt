Being a huge Mission Impossible fan, you can not imagine the excitement I had when I found a room here for a decent rate with my company's corporate discount. Sometimes, we get some awesome deals at great hotels like this. I also was upgraded to an Executive Room and boy was it a treat!!! Of course, the first thing I did was check for the Bible. Unfortuantely, it wasn't lithographed "Drake Hotel, Chicago, IL" as in the movie (Instead it was some Baptist Church in TN...disappointing). That being said, the room was phenominal. Quite large with a huge desk, massive king sized bed, free internet, large closets, comfortable desk chair, couch, beautiful paintings on the wall, well stocked mini bar and all of the appointments you'd expect in a top hotel. The best part part about getting an Excutive room is that you get exclusive access to a private dining room overlooking the lake. The breakfast was slightly disappointing, but definitely offset by the open bar and hors d'ouevres until 10 pm every night. Yes, that's right. The only disappointment was the gym, which I found a bit lacking in heavy free weights and size, but it was much better than the usual hotel gyms and adequate for a short stay. I can't wait to go back to Chicago and hope I get the good rate again. Crossing my fingers for another upgrade..... Even if you don't get an upgrade, it's not so bad here either. The rooms are still quite nice (though not as large). The only bummer is that you don't have access to the Executive Lounge with free drinks and breakfast. However, if you do ask, you might get lucky and get a key to it.
