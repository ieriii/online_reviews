**UPDATE** I took the day off of work and my boyfriend wanted to run to Pequod's for a quick lunch. They have a weekday lunch deal...a personal pan pizza with one topping and either pop or beer for $4.95. So, we dropped in...there were 2 other tables occupied. My boyfriend ordered the lunch deal, and I ordered a slice of mushroom. We waited 45 minutes (way longer then necessary). Finally, our waiter came out with my slice of pizza, which was completely over done. It was black on the bottom. He exclaimed that he was going to bring out my boyfriend's slice, but that it was a little overdone. He told my boyfriend that he didn't know what the "guys in the back were doing" but that he already asked them to put a new pizza in the oven. He brought the pizza out for us to look at and it was completely burnt. He suggested we wait 12 minutes for a new one...since we had already waited 3 times that, my boyfriend told them to forget it. We left without eating anything. It was a complete disappointment. This is the best Chicago-style pizza I've encountered. My boyfriend and I go once a week and order the deep-dish pizza. We recommend extra sauce and fresh garlic. As with many of my dining recommendations, this is not inexpensive pizza. But, it's worth every penny. The crust is the perfect blend of crisp and pan and it always comes out of the over piping hot. The toppings are $2.00 each, but it's been my experience that just cheese pizza is delicious (and I like a lot of toppings). The pizza is extremely filling...we usually get a medium and have some to take home.  And, if you're not into the pizza, or if you're looking for a little something extra, the garden salad is really nice. It's not the crunchy iceberg that you'd usually find at a pizza place. This is a nice romaine lettuce with a slice of tomato, onions and black olives. Very good...I ask for the dressing on the side.  Pequod's may have made me a pizza snob, but it's well worth it.
