I'm torn between giving this place a 3 or a 2. There was huge disparity in our experience. 1st -- we had to wait over 2 hours to get a table. There is no way to make a reservation unless you do so several weeks in advance. I find this silly and lame, but I also understand that may not be so unusual for Chicago restaurants. Whatever. We waited because my husband really wanted to try them out. To food -- amazing. It is really really really really good. The service -- absolutely sucked. I was shocked at how short they were with us and how much pressure we felt to hurry up, order, eat and get out. They came to our table several times to ask us if we were finished with a plate -- even as someone was fork to mouth eating off the plate. They couldn't have been even 5 minutes in between visits to see if we were ready for our check.  If it were up to me, we would never go back. I can't think of any service in the last several years that was so rude. But I may be forced to return if my husband gets his way. The food, in his opinion, is that good. I think few things are worth bad service.
