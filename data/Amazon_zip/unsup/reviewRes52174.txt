Pizza is great here for my first deep dish! The pizza was amazing with the crust layered on the bottom with a sausage patty on top of the crust. Then followed by the sauce and delectable, ooey, gooey mozzarella cheese. Then some Italian Sausage on the top. My only complaint: The crust. The crust was too dry and tasted like it needed butter or garlic or a combination of the two. This may have just been my pizza, but even if, they still need to learn to do better. It also may just be the way all Chicagoans make deep dish pizza. In my opinion, if you are going for your first deep dish pizza in the Windy City, Gino's East on Superior is the place to go. Located in the heart of Downtown Chicago and right next to the Magnificent Mile, you can shop and then go in to eat. I definitely recommend this pizza.
