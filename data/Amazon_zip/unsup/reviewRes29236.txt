Adorable Thai place in Lincoln Square neighborhood. Really great food at good prices. I I love the Tiger Cry beef, the pad Thai, and the yellow curry is delicious. I love the wood carvings on the walls. I love that it is BYOB.   Again, there are a million and two Thai places in the city, but this one has good food, good prices, and a nice (not dirty or cheap looking) atmosphere. A must-eat for Chicago cheap eats!
