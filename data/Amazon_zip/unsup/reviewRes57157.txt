It's over.I remember just over a year ago when I eagerly checked RevBrew's blog, anticipating the progress of my neighborhood's very own brew pub. I've been to Revolution many times since then, and I think it's time I call it quits.Revolution has become too loud, too busy, and my dining experience last night did me in. My mussels were a bit too slimy for comfort and my veggie reuben was a seasoning disaster. I also tried the mushroom pizza - fresh crimini's and just a hint of truffle oil - not bad but not enough to warrant the price. To put it simply - the menu is all concept and no performance. It's no longer enough to throw a dash of black truffle oil onto an entree and pull inspired, chef-driven dining 'out of a hat.'Here's the thing - I'm willing to overlook mediocre food at a brew pub if the beer is stellar (I'm looking at you, three floyds). Revolution's beer, however, (and I've had almost everything on the current menu) simply falls flat. Regardless of style, everything has a muted, underdeveloped flavor. I'd like to think this is the result of growing pains (looking at you, founders + bells). I never thought I'd say this, but I may take goose island over Revolution when it comes to beer. The 'guest list' of beers features some real winners, but the prices are simply unreasonable. I just about ordered a Dogfish 90 min IPA just to get some real flavor, but at $6 a bottle, why bother?
