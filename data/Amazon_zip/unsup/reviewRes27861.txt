So. Freaking. Good. Had the tasting menu. Everything was pretty fantastic. The stars were definitely the Butternut Squash soup and the Deconstructed Caesar Salad. Sooooo amazing good. Server was great. Robbie was attentive and speedy.  Had a really good experience before and after the meal at the bar. We will be back. Often!
