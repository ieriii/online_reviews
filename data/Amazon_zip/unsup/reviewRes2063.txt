When biting into a encased meat it must pop. Doug's dogs do that. Not only in original flavors but in interesting ones as well. I settled for the toulose dog with pate, french mustard, and a soft cheese topping it. My only regret was not being here on a Friday or Saturday to taste the duck fat fries.
