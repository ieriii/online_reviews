When I first moved to Chicago, I was living in the Wicker Park/Bucktown area. Everyday I would go exploring in my neighborhood and I stumbled upon this treasure and kept saying I need to go try it, but it definitely looked like a place you go with a friend or a fun group of people. Being new to Chicago, that wasn't really an option at the time, so I held off a few weeks. Ironically, my friend had a mutual contact here that he connected me with. When we were emailing back and forth the logistics of when we were free and I told her where I lived, she demanded we go to Piece. So a few days later, off we went. We went during the weeknight which is most likely the only time you will not have a 2 hour plus wait. We got seated fairly quickly and perused the menu. Everything sounded delicious, but after a long day of work, we were more concerned with our adult beverage. Piece is known for their incredible Micro brews, so I chose the 'Dark N Curvy ( I later had the Mariah) and it was delicious. We then decided on making our own red sauce pizza and it was also delicious. Probably the best thin crust I've ever had hands down. The service was amazing, the prices are comparable for the quality, and the loudness in the restaurant suits the atmosphere so you don't mind it. I have been back several times and there's always a wait, but thankfully, there are good beers to keep you occupied while you wait for table. It's fun for one-on-one and group settings.
