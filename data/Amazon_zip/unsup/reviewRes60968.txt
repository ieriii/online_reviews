i have to say we were ti 50 several times and i do enjoy coming there, the drins are nice, the food is avarage, the service is good i have to say.the reason for 3 stars is the chicken wings - they pride to be the best chicken wings in the city - ill tell you they may be right if you like them bredded and oily and no taste.me and my wife each had 1 and decided to through away the rest. other then that avarage nice bar to go to - just dont order the wings.
