Went there late on a Wednesday evening and had a great time. My girlfrend had a seafood ravioli dish - perfect portion size with delicious, generous sized shrimp on the side. I had the chicken vesuvio - large portion, juicy and flavorful (comes with mushrooms which I've never seen before). The service was great (attentive, filled out water often, etc) and the food was really good too. The place looks great.  It is a tad pricey for pasta, but the portions are big. Wish we had saved room for dessert.
