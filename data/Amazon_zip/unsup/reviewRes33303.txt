I might get beat for saying this....but I expected better. I mean, I was really sad to not like this place more...and I'm totally going to come back and try it again! The falafel was just sorta, blah...it didn't have a lot of flavor, the hummus didn't have much kick either. The pita seemed kinda stale and was falling apart and the cucumbers relish-type stuff seemed rubbery, like it had been sitting out for a while. The Lentil soup was spicy and pretty tasty and the restaurant was pretty cool. I will totally come back to try something else...all these good reviews can't be for nothin', right!?!
