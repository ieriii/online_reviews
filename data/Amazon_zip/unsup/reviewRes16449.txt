It gets 4 stars because the bathroom is freaken AMAZING. I felt like Alice in Wonderland! And the ceviche wasn't bad. The service was also very friendly. I felt like a princess. And Alice. But it was on the pricey side. I guess for that decor, it had to be? Drinks weren't that great. For a bar, I can see its perk although I came during the day.
