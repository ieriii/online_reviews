The Nanadict is by far one of my favorite breakfast dishes ever. I have to say the first time I ordered it I was a little nervous. I wasn't sure how it would all work together but omg. I am do glad I took the chance. It was soooo good that I have yet to have anything else because I just can't bring myself to order something else. My brother in law had the chilaquilles and he said it was really good also. I am really glad they opened a place like this do close to my house! Love it.
