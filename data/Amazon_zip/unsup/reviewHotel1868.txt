The W in San Francisco is much nicer than in Chicago. My biggest concern was the size of the rooms! I know it's an old building and such but I thought my room was down some narrow hallway and the room itself was rediculously small. The air conditioner made a loud BANG sound every 10 minutes which isn't good when you are jet lagged as it is. The customer service was quite good as the concierge spent about 20 minutes with me figuring out the best way to get to Northbrook, but that was the highlight of the stay.
