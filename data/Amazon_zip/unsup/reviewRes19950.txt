I went on the 2nd or 3rd day it opened and saw Rick Bayless. It made my day! A star for that. Other than seeing THE Rick Bayless, food was pretty okay.. sort of leaning towards good. I ordered the woodland mushroom torta, 3 churros, and a barcelona. My friend ordered the choriqueso torta. We both thought the bread had that fresh bread.. crunch. LOL, hope that made sense. I thought my torta was lacking flavor..tasted very plain. The churros were pretty good, not extraordinary. The barcelona was kind of disappointing.. not as rich as I thought it would be? I can still say to this day that Hot Chocolate(the restaurant) has THE BEST hot chocolate thus far.
