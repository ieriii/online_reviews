Some of the best pho in Chicago! This place has good Vietnamese food at reasonable prices. Good, friendly and quick service. Their most popular dish is obviously their pho and I heard they cook their broth with beef bones (and yes, MSG, but doesn't everyone?) for hours, which produces a great flavor. Good spot for a cool summer evening or a freezing winter night, or any day of the year!
