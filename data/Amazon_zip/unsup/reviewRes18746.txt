Menu offered a nice selection of meats and tortas as well as soups and salads. I had the subkling pig with pickled onions and a black bean spread with habanero salsa on the side. Let me tell you- that is the BEST habanero salsa I have ever had. It was of course spicy hot but not overwhelming to the point you couldn't dip your sandwich in for every bite you took. There are places to sit down and the staff was friendly but this is definitely more of a quick lunch spot.
