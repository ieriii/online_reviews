Haven't been here for awhile and came here with a groupon. Worth 5 stars:  - amazingly fresh asparagus salad that paired perfectly with the sweet cherry tomatoes and soft goat cheese - very fresh pasta (mini lasagne that came with the osso bucco), friendly service, pleasant greeting from the hostess - crisp/sweet/not too sweet Riesling - panna cotta consistency is heavier than other restaurants', had the hazelnut one, absolutely delicious.  Only suggestion for improvement: osso bucco a bit salty
