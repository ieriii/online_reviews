The huevos rancheros was filling and delectable! My boyfriend had the smoked salmon bagel, which included a generous portion of the fish and delicious chive cream cheese.  There seems to be a lot of complaints about the service, but given that you don't get table service that means you get to leave less tip and you get seated faster. And the fewer items on the menu means that Milk & Honey can keep their prices low (less inventory to stock) and the kitchen can work faster to make your food (fewer dishes to juggle). I actually enjoyed the cozy atmosphere and the hustle and bustle of the cafe on Sunday morning; it really added to my experience and reminded me of an European coffee house or market. I was catching up with an old friend so we didn't even notice that the wait.
