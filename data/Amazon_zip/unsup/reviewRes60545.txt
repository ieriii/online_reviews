The place is beautiful. My boyfriend and I sat by the window over looking Michigan ave. The service was great. And the food was not so good. I had the veal with the pasta and the veal was very dry, which nicely matched the dry pasta on the side of my plate. My boyfriend did enjoy his steak so I guess don't get the veal when you are there but do go for the steak!
