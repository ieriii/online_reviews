After living in Chicago for 3 years I'm soo glad I finally got to try this place out!!! We got there around 1135 on a lovely Saturday, and we were ordering by 1215 (yes i timed this). Doug is such a nice guy, he is so friendly and honest. Someone in front of us ordered a large soda and he suggested them just getting a small since its free refills! So nice! I got the chicken w/gouda and apple...delish! We also got the duck fat fries...honestly if no one told me they were different than regular fries I'm not sure I would've totally noticed. They are really crispy and well cooked! I wasnt sure of what to expect at the establishment itself but its super clean for such a crowded place. And it really wasn't that hard to find seating at all....since I guess how long can it really take to eat a hot dog haha. Definitely try to check this place out =) I don't think its super easy to get to by public transportation, but I'm sure it can be done :P
