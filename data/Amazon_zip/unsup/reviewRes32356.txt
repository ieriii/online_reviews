To me, Demera was a mixed bag. Let's start with the positives, as I fancy myself a "glass half-full" kind of guy. Overall, I thought the food was quite tasty. My table ordered a variety of meat and vegetable dishes, and almost without exception, they were well-prepared, flavorful, and filling. I particularly enjoyed the lamb tibs and the red lentils. The sambussas that were ordered as an appetizer, while tasty, were a bit on the greasy side. The dining room was also pleasant, warm, colorful, and roomy. The live music - provided by an incredibly bizarre-looking octogenarian wearing a blindingly teal get-up - was a nice touch. Now for the negatives. First, the service, while courteous, could only kindly be called incompetent. We waited for the server to make her initial visit, we waited for our appetizers, we waited for her to come back to take our dinner order, and we waited, and waited, for dinner to come out. Needless to say, we did a lot of waiting. And when the food came, we were a bit perturbed to see that the four separate meals that were ordered - for nine people to share - came on a single platter! As you can imagine, having nine people feeding off of one platter requires a level of dexterity and flexibility that generally does not lend itself to a relaxing dining experience. When we tried to explain the problem to the waitress, she looked at us as if we said, "I hate puppies" - total bewilderment. Final verdict - would I come back? I'd say yes, as the quality grub outshone the service problems.
