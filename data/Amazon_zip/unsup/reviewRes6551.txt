We went to dinner on a Monday and it was busy. We took a communal table which worked out fine so we were seated immediately. I had been googleing all day looking for a restaurant in Chicago that served past and Sea Urchin. Found it and was sooooo pleased. I ate every bit of it. You have to love Sea Urchin and if you do this is an ultimate treat. We shared the pork belly, delicious and we shared the truffle egg. My daughter and i shared a bottle of chianti for $14.00 with a corking fee of $7. All and all I know i will be craving some more of the Linguini and Sea Urchin so we'll be back.
