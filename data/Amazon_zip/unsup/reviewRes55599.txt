we recently used cafe 28 to cater our wedding in the south loop. cafe 28 is our favorite restaurant in chicago so we thought what better food could we have for our wedding? it turned out amazing! we had heavy appetizers instead of a formal dinner with the food being passed as well as stationary and it was delicious! We weren't sure how are guests would like not having a full dinner but everyone raved about the food, and we had the largest bowl of guacamole i've ever seen! cafe 28 was great to work with and they walked us through tasting the menu, helped us decide how to present and serve the food, and even rented us equipment.  delicious!
