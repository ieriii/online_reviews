I have to come here for brunch every time I visit Chicago. Serving a bloody mary with a side of beer is pure genius. Every restaurant should be so smart. Booze aside, the pork belly bacon is really what I come back for. Divine. My mouth waters thinking about the steak with peaches mint and feta makes my mouth water. This flavor profile blew my mind. Wine poached eggs is equally amazing. Excellent staff & service. Fab decor.
