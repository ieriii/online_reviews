Oh how I love you, Sultan's. I'm always tempted to try to salad bar because it looks incredible, but I cannot bring myself to stray from their falafel sandwich. It's always fresh, the jerusalem salad they put on it is sooo good (some kind of yogurt, parsley, cucumber, tomato mixture) and their hummus is the best. I suggest you order it medium spicy. Yumyumyum. Not to mention that and a can of soda come to a whopping $5. It also dawned on me one day to get a pint of hummus to go and they gave me a whole package of fresh pita included in the price, which I think was around $6? Amazing. Even though Chickpea has since opened and is closer to my apartment, I will still usually choose to walk the slightly further distance for the falafel at Sultans. P.S. the boys behind the counter are adorable, which doesn't hurt
