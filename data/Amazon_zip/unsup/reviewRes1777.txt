As you stand outside of Hot Doug's at the rear of what is almost always a meandering line, an uncontrollable excitement will start to bubble from within. While others bounce out of the restaurant so filled with pleasure and you creep into position you will involuntarily enter a pre-meal euphoric state. I usually spend this agonizing wait will perusing the menu digitally and planning what could easily become my death row meal.  Having enjoyed the Chicago dog, spicy jerk sausage, froie gras dog, and duck fat fries, among others I have to say "This is f'ing it!!" Despite the bustling surroundings, it is the kind of experience that you want to hold on to and just let it sit like a sweet candy on the tongue.. What new can even be said that hasn't already been expressed by a thousand other giddy Hot Doug's lovers. All I can add is that this is the standard by which I now judge other purveyors of tubular shaped meat. It is also the place that has inspired new ways to embellish and prepare food at home. When the palette is challenged in such unexpected and rewarding ways I can easily say that a trip to Chicago will always be garnished with a Hot Doug's feast!
