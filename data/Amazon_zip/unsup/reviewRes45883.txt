I'll keep it short, but sweet.  Skipping past the bad service and my greasy "modern" cuban sandwich and get right to the heart of our trip here: the BEIGNETS!  I am half New Orleansian by blood and was salivating for a taste of my adulthood (childhood trips involved maybe 2 beignet ventures, whereas adulthood visits involve a "beignet every day I'm in NOLA" commitment) and I was thoroughly disappointed. Overcooked on the outside and gooey-in-a-bad-way raw on the inside. Grand Luxe has sullied beignets good name.   I'll say it- the beignets I had in Senegal were more authentic. Truth.
