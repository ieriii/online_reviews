Food was good - I had their crevice trio and a burrito with goat meat. Do not order a Vampire bloody marry, it tastes like a sudden decrease in salary. 3 stars for waiting time. It was ridiculous (and took 3 hours) since they do not take reservations. Interior is beautiful and the staff is OK. Try this place on a weekday perhaps.
