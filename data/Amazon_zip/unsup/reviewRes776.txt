I know what you're thinking. There MUST be a reason all these people will wait in line for hours for a hot dog, right? That's definitely what I thought and why I decided to try Hot Doug's. Unfortunately, the food did not live up to the hype. I came on a Friday around 11:30 and the line was halfway down the building (which is actually not bad). The entire visit took about 1 hour. We ordered a Chicago dog, fois grois dog, "Mountain Main" dog and duck fat fries. The Chicago dog was good but not worth waiting in line for. I can go down the street from my house to Portillo's and be just as happy. The fois dog was just what I was expecting it to be. Too rich. I couldn't even finish half. The "Mountain man" sausage was my favorite of the three but still not worth waiting in line for. And the duck fat fries tasted like regular fries. Would I come back? Sure, if the line is less than an hour long. The sausages here are tasty but not so much that I would stand in line for one.
