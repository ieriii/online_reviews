Came with my girlfriends to celebrate an engagement. Pros: All the food was excellent. All of it. Outdoor seating was nice, although I wish they'd had the heat torches going because it was chilly. Cons: Doesn't take reservations. 90+ minute wait. But it's a new, trendy place, so I understand that. We received terrible, terrible, service. Ben, I'm looking at you, and I remember your name because you might be the most disinterested, woe-is-me and above-it-all server I have ever encountered. Disgusted when we asked for recommendations, annoyed when we wanted to order more food, and generally just irritated at our general presence. It really burned me that he got a 20% mandatory gratuity from our party of 6 because he was clearly---CLEARLY--a 10% kind of guy. And you've really got to suck to get that low. Purple Pig, had it not been for this, I would probably return.
