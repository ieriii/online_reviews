I'm giving this place 5 stars, and I also gave Kuma's Corner 5 stars. Is that ok? Of course freakin' yeah! Were Obi Wan Kenobi and Luke Skywalker both equally awesome? Of course freakin' yeah! Don't come to Lockdown and expect the same experience as Kuma's, or the other way around. Lockdown isn't quite the "experience" that Kuma's is- not as themed or as famous. Going to Lockdown isn't really as much a food adventure as Kuma's is. If you like fishing (I'm don't really, but I did come up with a good analogy), I'd say Kuma is catching one big tuna and Lockdown is catching several salmon. Hm... maybe this wasn't that great of an analogy after all... Lockdown is much cheaper than Kuma's, and definitely a lot more accessible I think. The wait just isn't as long. How's the burger? If Kuma's burger is 100/100, then I'd say Lockdown is 93/100. I don't think it's quite as good, but heck, I'm paying about 1/2 the price and I don't have to wait an hour in line. If you go on Tuesday, almost all the burgers are around $7 and that includes fries!! Lockdown is a place I can frequent once a week (on Tues only cus I'm cheap like that), whereas I have to build up time and energy to visit Kuma's. Both are great places though. I'd take my neighbor to Lockdown while I'll take a tourist to Kuma's. That said, I'd probably also expect a line if you go to Lockdown during peak hours, just not as long a wait. Seriously, both places need to expand their capacity.
