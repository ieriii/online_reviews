I have dined here on several occasions, and the restaurant is consistently good. Service is slow - too many tables per server. The restaurant is loud, the wine list lofty, and the pricing is a little high for portions. Dessert menu is skimpy. However, the food is always reliable. The menu is fun, traditional, rustic Italian comprised of local ingredients. Overall, we always enjoy the food and experience. One more wait person to split the room better would go a long way.
