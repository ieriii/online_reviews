Service? Meh. The host was wonderful and gracious, the servers...where the heck were they? It was not a bad experience, I just felt very last minute to them and a little forgotten about. If I hadn't been with such good company, I would have been a little annoyed. Beers were good, oysters good, sashimi good, aioli for the medicore frites good but our main dish was a bit of a flop. Dungenous crab which was tasty over cubed undercooked and underseasoned squash. Not a bad experience but unimpressed.
