I've been here twice. Once last March and once last weekend. The first time the meat was cooked perfect. You could choose from a rare cut of beef from one side of the roast or a more well done piece for the non-rare meateater. This past weekend, the red meats were overcooked and the choices of meats didn't circulate near as much as the did last year. For example, it wasn't until we got our check that we saw the lamb chops and shrimp come out, and we were at the first table by where the gouchos come out of the kitchen with the meats.  It is definitely not worth $48.50. I like the selection and novelty of Brazilian Steakhouses, but I watch so many peeps fall for their "let's fill them up at the massive salad bar" ploy, so there's no way you are getting your $$'s worth. You want a nice prime rib cooked to your liking? Go to the Chicago Chop House around the corner and get a 16oz Prime Rib with potato and salad for $28. :) PS: Fogo de Chao is better, IMO.
