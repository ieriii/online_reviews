Five stars because it's darn tasty and easy on the wallet. Probably part of the reason for being so busy. Went last Sunday before the Hawks game at 5pm and was seated immediately (last table), and even a few tables eventually opened. Not sure what they put in the cheese pizza but holy cow it literally was the tastiest thing I've eaten in a long time. I will be going back soon.
