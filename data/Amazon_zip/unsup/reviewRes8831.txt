My boyfriend and I eat here all the time. The pizza is absolutely incredible, made with pizza flour imported from a flour mill in Italy with the same family name as me. When I mentioned this to the owner (who was making rounds talking to guests and handing out free dessert wine) he went to the basement and came back with a t shirt and a bandanna with the company logo on it for me. Fantastic.
