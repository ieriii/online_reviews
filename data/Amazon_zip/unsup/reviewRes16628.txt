Yes, it has a snooty reputation. But, they were surprisingly accommodating to us on a busy Wednesday night. Originally with a reservation for four, my two punctual friends went with just a table for them. When I showed up a half hour late, rather than make me wait for a 3-person table to open up, they placed an extra seat at the table. Then 5 minutes later, our fourth arrived. This time, they let us move from the table to a booth. I was taken aback by how much they were willing to work with people running on CPT. For a group of people in our mid-20s, this was the perfect blend of hipness and sophistication (and even pretentiousness). Our waitress was personable and when I asked for a drink that had rotated off the menu, she knew enough about their ingredient supply to tell me that yes, I could get a Berliner. Get there early in one group, turn off your cell phones, and prepare for the perfect shit-shooting atmosphere.
