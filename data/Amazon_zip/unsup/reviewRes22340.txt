I would have given this restaurant five stars in the past, but today's experience was terrible. We have never had bad service here in the past and the food was terrific. However today was the worse dining experience ever. We came here for one thing, hot pot. It took the servers twenty minutes to get our order, another 45 minutes to get one plate of food ut after the hotpot came out, and another twenty just to get the cooking baskets,another twenty minutes till we got the rest of our plates of food. I saw our server go out for four ten minute smoke breaks during our dinner, not once did he ask us if we had everything we needed or if things were ok. It's really amazing how a bad server could really ruin dinner, it took him another half an hour to get us our check. The food was as usual, great, but the service gets a zero, maybe even a a negative 4 on a scale of ten. I may have to look for a new hot pot place if they don't improve thier service.
