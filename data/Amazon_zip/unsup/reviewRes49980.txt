If you're going to sell 40-ouncers in a bag, you shouldn't be calling yourself, "Fifty/50." A more appropriate name would be, "Fiddy Fiddy," but that's neither here nor there. As many have stated, this bar is not nearly as bad as I imagined it might be. Of course, I was there on a Monday night, so that certainly cut down on the fartknocker factor. (Fartknocker is a euphemism for the overused "douchebag." (And douchebag is a euphemism for "overused douchebag," in case you were wondering.)) I must admit, I like the arrangement of this bar. It's got open windows with outdoor seating, a spacey first floor layout that doesn't limit easy access to the bar, and an upstairs loft. Unfortunately, I was able to locate only one bathroom on the first floor--a unisex room, meaning I had to put the seat down after draining my lizard--BOOOOOO. So if you go on a busy night, it may be wise to invest in some adult diapers. (If you choose this option, please note that you might have to explain how you suddenly have a ghetto booty to go along with your sexy FUPA.) Pricing on beers is a bit steep, especially if the bartender neglects to give you some of your change as he did with me. I guess I can't blame him though, the female sitting at the end of the bar was far better looking than me, so why bother paying attention to some chump ordering a beer. Even if I had received my rightful $0.50, I can't deny that I still felt a little ripped off paying $3.50 for a 12-oz. can of Old Style. So the big question is... Would I return here? Yes, but... Would I wear lipstick and a short mini skirt to ensure I receive correct change? Of course. Would I wear some Huggies to avoid potential bathroom woes? You betcha. Would I get so drunk that by the end of the evening I've hugged, kissed, high fived, or given a reach around to every person in the bar at least once? No. I don't like fartknockers that much.
