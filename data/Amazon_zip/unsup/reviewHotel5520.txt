A lot of positives about this hotel: it's just a block or two from the train station downtown, so very easy to get to. Very clean and good service staff. The room was huge, and had many of the conveniences that some hotels skimp on, like a fridge and a microwave. I really liked the room and the conveniences that if offered. Nice location, as it's right downtown, but one minor drawback is that a lot of the restaurants and stores nearby close early because it's located in a predominately commercial area. That said, you really don't have to go far to find places that are open later, so it was a minor inconvenience. One negative (and I should have taken a picture) was the "view" from the window. I'm sure some of the rooms have great views, but ours was of the wall on the opposite side of the courtyard where you bring in your car when you arrive. Not a major problem, but given its location, La Quinta could have laid out more of the rooms to offer better views. Overall, it's a great price for a night right in the middle of downtown.
