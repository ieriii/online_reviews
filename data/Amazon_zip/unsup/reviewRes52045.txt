Eeeeeeeeh, I'm sorry but a solid 'meh' is the most that I can give this place. But this is an absolutely SOLID 'meh'. Let me just start by saying that the food was good. So listen to my story, 'cause this is how it went down in Chi-town (yes, I'm aware that rhymed and henceforth lends ultimate validity to my review). I came here on a Saturday, because I had one day in town and I wanted to get my deep dish on. I'd had delivery from Giordano's before, and I enjoyed it, but I wanted to see what it would be like at an actual pizzeria in the city. So I went to the Giordano's downtown- 45 minute wait for one, no pizza at the bar. So I decided to move on. I'd heard good things about Gino's, so I went to go check it out. They were able to seat me immediately at the bar, so I took my place and looked over the menu. Now, I know that deep dish pizzas tend to be a little on the pricey side, but you only have to eat about half as much. But still... twenty-something dollars for a small 'Cheeseburger' pizza? Honestly, I might have splurged if I didn't plan to walk around the city for hours, because I knew that I'd only be able to eat a couple of slices. But I didn't. I got a stromboli, and it was really damned good. They use their pizza crust for the strombolis, and it was a solidly good meal. Now, I wasn't a big fan of their beer selection. No IPA's?!??! I tried a couple and was pretty underwhelmed, though my server was very nice and helpful. All in all, I give this place three and a half stars. It is what it is, a popular, tourist-and-local heavy place that delivers pretty good food and nice serve. So why not four or five stars? Simply- I just didn't LOVE it, and probably won't be back. I know that I can get great pizza from plenty of other places, with better beer selections, and shorter waits. But you really should try it out for yourself. Maybe I'll capitulate and up it to four stars if I ever go again. ... but probably not.
