I came to Chicago to visit for business and decided to wait it out in the wind for an hour to sample some unique dogs. They must be good if people will wait in the wind and cold for 1 hour right? Absolutely right! I had the wild boar, alligator, and the classic Chicago dog. The wild boar was hands down the best hot dog I have ever eaten. The alligator was also delicious. The Chicago dog was the best I had on my trip to Chicago. If you haven't been there yet, GO!
