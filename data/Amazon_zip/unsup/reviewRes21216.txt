I just tried Xoco for the first time tonight--we went for a brief little dessert/treat. The line was literally out the door (ridiculous!) but we were able to get served fairly quickly. My husband and I had the churros and the Atzec hot chocolate. Both were intensely flavorful and really, truly decadent. The desserts were excellent and we will definitely be going back for lunch some time soon!
