I lived in Chicago for a few years between high school and college (sometime shortly after Gutenberg had printed his first Bible). I was too young and too poor to enjoy many of the places I would have liked, so when I registered for a huge scientific meeting in Chicago I chose The Palmer House as my hotel. When I was explaining my choice to some colleagues I told them that it used to be very elegant, but now was a little worn and frayed around the edges and the plumbing was a little iffy. One of the younger members of the group said "That sounds just like you, Dr. Rick" to which someone added "When the hell was Rick ever elegant?". The service was perfect and the room, albeit small compared to newer hotels, was very comfortable and quiet. I have a 3G wireless widget for my computer, so I didn't have to pay for their expensive Internet connection. A coffee pot would have been nice in the room, but there's a Starbucks on the street level. All in all, my stay was pleasant and since it's so close to the museums and other downtown attractions I'd stay there again if I had more time to enjoy the city.
