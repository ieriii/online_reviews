Sometimes there is such a thing as a free lunch...and boy was it tasty. When given a choice for her birthday lunch my co-worker/friend chose The Gage. Getting invited to tag along felt like I was the one getting the birthday present! The Gage is classy, lots of dark wood, charming little rooms full of tables, tablecloths and a charming Irishman at the front of the house who can speak a little French too (he made the birthday girl swoon)! Located right across from Millennium Park and the Art Institute it's a great spot to grab a bite; it won't be a cheap meal, but in my opinion it's worth it. I ordered the grilled albacore sandwich and the rest of our table ordered mussels, potatoes with brie, fish and chips, the regular burger, mixed lettuce salad and chicken and giant noodle soup. Everyone seemed very happy with their meals and the portions are very generous. Per my co-workers the fish and chips were very light and fresh. If you order the mussels bring your appetite, they give you enough for two; my friend shared some of her mussels with us and still couldn't make a sizable dent. The mussels were large and tasty, I loved them over the spicy vindaloo sauce. My sandwich, served with fries, was seared albacore with pickled onion, horseradish aioli, lettuce and green beans on a roll. It was quite good, but also quite messy. I think it would've been a lot easier to eat if they eased up on the lettuce; I also think the lettuce distracted from some of the other flavors. Service was attentive and friendly, we never wanted for a refill and our food came quickly. Lunch gets pretty busy so I would make reservations, unless you want to risk a wait. I can't wait to come back and try some other things. Now, I just have to find a way to convince another co-worker to do a birthday lunch, invite me and have it here!
