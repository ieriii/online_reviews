This was hands down by far the best restaurant experience I have ever had. PERIOD. I was here on a date one Sunday afternoon, and Bobby was our server/ Bartender. He was incredibly knowledgeable about the restaurant's history, the menu, and food/ drinks in general. He was very attentive, but super chill as well. Each dish we had was beautifully prepared and equally every bit as delicious. I wish I had a favorite, but I loved them ALL! We had the seared ahi tuna, roasted peppers, the cheese and pine nut flat bread, cauliflower and broccoli, and desert.... WHOA! This took it to the next level. I adore sweets, and this definitely was the perfect way to end the meal. It was a coconut ice cream coated in chocolate topped with a candied walnut accompanied with a warm croquette and ganache. Talk about heaven on Earth. I would recommend this to anyone who loves amazing food and appreciates a nice dining ambience with amazing service.
