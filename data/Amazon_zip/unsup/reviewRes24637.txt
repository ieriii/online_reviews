Ever so tasty! I was there last night for Food Network Magazine event, but I recognized some of the appetizers they were passing around as part of the normal menu.  Almond and blue cheese stuffed dates wrapped with bacon - YUM!  Duck meatballs....never been a fan of duck, but these bad boys were addictive. I am not sure what it is usually like but it was a cool place to have an event and all the food was just tasty.
