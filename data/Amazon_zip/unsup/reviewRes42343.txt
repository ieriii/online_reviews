My favoritest pizza in the world is stuffed spinach with sausage, and after reading so many 4 and 5 star reviews for Art of Pizza, I was expecting to be absolutely blown away by their version. But I wasn't. A good stuffed spinach pizza should have loads of spinach baked into every mouthful of cheese, but it seemed that the spinach was just sprinkled on rather sparsely. And the sausage was served up in bland little nuggets. In spite of the disappointment with my particular pizza selection, I can see a few reasons why Art of Pizza might please other pizza enthusiasts: - They offer a good variety of pizzas by the slice - and by that I mean a truly GOOD selection of fairly fresh slices, not a paltry handful of dried-up leftover slices like you see at a lot of pizza places. - The sauce has a unique sweet/tangy flavor and the crust is somewhat tender and buttery - though not quite as buttery-good as Lou Malnati's buttercrust. - They have parking! Though my pizza selection didn't measure up to many other local pizza vendors that can do the stuffed sausage/spinach combo just right - such as Chicago's Pizza, Edwardo's, Bacino's, Giordano's - I may someday try Art of Pizza again to see if I have better luck with another type of pie.
