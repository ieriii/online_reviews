I used to trek here from Lincoln Park when I was in grad school living in Chicago... The Superior Street location was a Gino's east location for ~40 years before a fire destroyed it. The location spent a few years as another pizza chain but Gino's reclaimed the location in 2007. Many places make great deep dish pie in Chicago, Gino's East is one of them and is one of my favorites. I love the fact that Gino's is back on Superior, when I am in Chicago on business I always make a stop here for a deep dish sausage and pepperoni pie. I've brought dozens and dozens of colleagues here through the years and no one is ever disappointed...
