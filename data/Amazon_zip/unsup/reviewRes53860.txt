DELICIOUS! Everything we ordered was amazing. The milk braised pork shoulder, the fried brussels sprouts, the artichokes & fingerling potatoes and the fried olives stuffed with chorizo...wonderful.The only downside is that it's a pretty small space and it was packed! We heard everything the people sitting next to us had to say and it took a little too long in between the veggies & the meat dishes. BUT this place has a spot on my top ten list.
