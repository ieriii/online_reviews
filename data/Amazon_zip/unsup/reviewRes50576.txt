Who dares to besmirch the good name of Wishbone in my presence? Try it, and I shall cast a pox upon you. I don't know if really there is any way to fully express how I feel about Wishbone's brunch...except maybe in a Shakespearean sonnet: Thine walls are adorned with chickens and dogs, And thine omelettes contain jambalaya. Your cuisine is from states with bayous, bogs, And swamps, with just a hint of la playa! Will it be salmon, crab or crawfish cakes? Perhaps I will do the andouille hash; I will be happy with what the cook makes 'Cause I know it will be out in a flash. Cakes of corn with pepper sauce red and sweet, Shrimp and grits, French toast that does ere go "crunch," Oh look! Black bean cakes! They do not have meat! It's two in the afternoon; time to munch! To drink: a strawberry mimosa! Wishbone, I'm glad Sunday draws in closer!
