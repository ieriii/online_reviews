This was my first time visiting this location of Uncommon Ground, though I have visited the other spot many times and love it. After a bit of trouble finding the parking lot, I made it in! This is a nice spot. There are two large dining areas which are set up with a good mix of table sizes so that larger groups and smaller parties can sit. There's also a bar area which is set apart in a room that looks extremely comforting and relaxing.  I visited for a private party, and had not had any of the menu items before, but everything was delicious. The potato latkes were delicious, but HUGE - I seriously couldn't finish my portion. I also tried the french toast with cinnamon butter (yum!), egg scramble, and house-made sausages. Everything was really flavorful.  I didn't try the bloody marys, but from what I've heard, they are delicious. My coffee was always full and quite tasty.  Service was a bit slow on drinks, but that's because we were a large party. I think typically, service would be great.  I will say that it's a bit confusing upon entering. I entered from the parking lot, which is easy enough if you can see the entrance. There is also what looks to be an entrance on the street, but if you come in that way, there is no host stand...I'm not sure which is the main door, but you might have to weave your way through the restaurant to find someone to seat you.
