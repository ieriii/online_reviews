What a great spot! I've heard that this is the place where chinese people come to eat in chinatown. And now, I can see why. The menu items seem very authentic. We ordered the following: -Pork dumplings dim sum -House special spicy Fried Rice -Sze Chuan Chicken -Pork Intestines Except for the pork intestines, everything tasted fresh and delicious. We had heard great things about pork intestines, but I think we're just not hardcore enough to try something so exotic (yet). I will definitely be back to try one of the other 176378634637 items on the menu. The staff was eager and patient to help us choose our dishes. The place get's pretty crowded and if you're not present when they call your table number, that's it...no soup for YOU! So go at off peak hours and wait for your table..it will be well worth it!
