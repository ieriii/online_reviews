The perfect fondue experience for a romantic evening. The lighting is low, but it isn't dark inside. The booths are nice and cozy if you manage to get one, but the tables are fine as well. The food is delicious! The salad and cheese fondue are amazing, and pretty filing. The main courses are great, and the dipping sauces add to the meal so much. By the chocolate course we were incredible full, but couldn't turn down a mouth watering chocolate fondue. And the wine list was excellent! Not a place for families or kids or even friends, but definitely a good place to celebrate something special or impress a date!
