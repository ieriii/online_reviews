A friend and I were looking for new places to have brunch at during the week and ended up at The Bongo Room on a Friday around noon.  The wait was only about 15 minutes, despite it being pretty busy,and probably due to the fact that we were fine being seated at the bar, which is were we ended up. The staff working the bar were great, refilling our water and coffee when we needed it. The bartender that was waiting on us seemed a little drunk (maybe she had a crazy Thursday night) but was friendly, nonetheless. I ordered an omelet with bacon, mushrooms and swiss. My friend ordered the croissant sandwich, which has egg, bacon and muenster. The food took a little while to arrive, but that's to be expected for how busy they were. Once we were handed our plates, the food looked good, the hash browns that came with each order were perfectly cut potatoes sprinkled with rosemary and salt. My omelet looked great, and my friends croissant was golden and flaky. However, once we started eating we both realized that the food was all look and texture, no flavor. The eggs were boring, the bacon in my omelet wasn't crispy but it wasn't too soft either, it was just hard and flavorless. And I love bacon, like most sane people, so how are you going to serve mediocre bacon?! The potatoes were just starchy and the spices seemed to be non existent, even though like they were thoroughly spiced. We are both big fans of salty breakfast, and after looking around at other plates we realized that perhaps, The Bongo Room serves better sweets for brunch. I would probably go back again, but I would definitely not order the same thing.
