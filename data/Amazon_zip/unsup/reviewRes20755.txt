The sushi is some of the best I have had ever. It is very fresh and the portions and prices are great. Between my husband and I, we split a seaweed salad, Red V, White Dragon, Crunchy Spicy Tuna and Fresh Philly. All were amazing but the highlight was definitely the Red V. Its always on the chalkboard menu by the sushi bar. The seaweed salad was fresh and so flavor full. My husband never really is in the mood for sushi ever cause men love their meat. I finally convinced him to go and he was even raving how great the sushi was. Alas, a sushi place my husband will want to go to. BYOB too!!!
