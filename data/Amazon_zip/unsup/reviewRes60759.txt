We were delighted that Uncommon Ground came to Edgewater. The neighborhood really needed a good sit down place for brunch, lunch and dinner and I have had positive experiences on weekdays at this location, but today, not so much. We called earlier in the week to get reservations, and were told they didn't accept them for parties under 8 people. We arrived before 9, and there was already a long line of families waiting. The hostess seated families ahead of us and families after us of the same size and with children of the same age as our four year old. Not us, we were sent to the bar - we were told that they didn't have open tables - which clearly wasn't true because from the bar I could see a half dozen open tables in one room and several more in the back room.  We asked the bartender - who was defensive at first, but then went to management to get us a table. We waited 45 minutes for cold lattes that were supposed to be hot, an hour and ten minutes for breakfast that was also cold. We saw parties that came in after us served before we were, and witnessed the hostess spew her special venom at more than one Mother trying to enjoy breakfast with her family. I do not recommend Uncommon Ground, which is a shame because as I said, Edgewater Glen really does need a few places like this where you can sit down to good regional cuisine.
