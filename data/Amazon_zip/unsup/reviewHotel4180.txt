I can't say any negative about this hotel. See the reasons why; 1. Location is great. You are on Wacker Road and a block on Magnificent Mile. 2. There's a Corner Bakery close to the hotel for breakfast (1 block). 3. A minute walk to major bus stops. 4. There's BIG BAR!!! (see my other review). 5. Room deco is minimal - no fancy stuff but it's very clean. 6. Millenium Park (a block), The Loop (about 3 blocks), and shopping area is a block. 7. There's a 24 hour deli which is a plus. Take note; 1. At first, I was disappointed because of the location. I wanted it to be noisy, crowded and a touristy area - maybe close to small restaurants etc. (Stay at The Loop Area or Magnificent Mile area if you prefer it that way). But it was a good decision after all. Wacker Road is a major road and it's very convenient when you are a tourist (bus stops). There's a BIG BAR open at night in the hotel and it's always crowded. I mean crowded until 2am everyday even on weekdays! 2. No free breakfast and internet. Complimentary coffee and tea though. 3. Employees are great and helpful. 4. Hotel lobby is not boutique style - it's actually convention/airport like atmosphere. Always crowded and noisy (lobby only) - the way I like. 5. Ok, just one thing... if people are talking on the hallway, it echoes to your room - I think it's an acoustical thing. It happens when we arrived there at about 10am. We usually go out at 10am so no problem at all. At night, nice and quiet. Yes, I recommend this place.
