Great balance of quantity and quality! Definitely agree with Stephanie M. - go for lunch if you can (save $), but book a hotel room closeby so that you can take an afternoon nap after all of that good food. Also, save room for dessert or squeeze it in anyways. It is extra, but well worth it. Share with everyone at the table.
