Hopleaf, Hopleaf, how I love thee! This place single-handedly transformed me into a beer lover. Absolutely the place to woo the friend who insists they "aren't into beer." Love the food, too. The mussels with frites and garlic aioli are perfect to share. No stars deducted for the doorman who, without fail, scrutinizes my I.D. every time, no matter if it's the third evening I'm coming in in a single week (I've only done that once.) I can't imagine he sees enough New Hampshire driver's licenses to forget in such a short span of time... but, bygones, the friendly (and beer-savvy) bartenders are gracious and efficient and this reception ultimately overwhelms the stubbornly-exclusive aura of the entryway.  Yes it gets crowded but only because it is worth it, and the alert dance one must perform to earn a table or booth is just part of the experience. Or you could escape upstairs to the cash-only section if it feels too claustrophobic in the main bar.
