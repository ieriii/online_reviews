Very yummy! Great seasonings on their Korean bbq. I last went there a week ago, and I still can remember the smell of the bbq! Actually your clothes and hair may also remember for a long time haha. It's a fun spot too - lots of room, can get crowded, and they're open super late. You can walk there from downtown Lincoln Square.
