This place has amazing sushi. the fish is always so fresh and the rolls are so unique. We go there for dinner a lot and order delivery as well. Try the spicy scallop roll and the spicy tako (sp?).The reason for my 4 star rating is due to the following: A) service is not great. The women always seem so mad when you order another glass of wine after you've finished all of your food. I mean, come on, I just ordered 90 dollars worth of food and want to have another glass of wine, and you are gonna give me a dirty look cuz you want the next party to be seated. I get it, there are ppl waiting, but I shouldn't be rushed out of my table by having a check placed in front of me, when I still wanted to order something else.B) the cash bar is cool, trendy and upbeat. But what is up with the smoke making type machine, this isnt sound bar people!! It gets ways too smoky in there, but oh well, beats waiting elsewhere.Other than that, really best sushi in town, I def recommend the food to a lot of ppl. I just wish they can fix the small issues mentioned above.
