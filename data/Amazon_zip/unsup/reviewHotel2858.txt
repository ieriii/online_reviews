A++ for the fluffiest down beds & 4 overstuffed pillows! Waking up grumpy was not an option & these *blissful* beds did the trick. - Location- Great! $5 taxi ride to the Blue Line if you are coming from O'Hare. Walking distance to Michigan street (shopping!) and the Chicago River Walk ( sight seeing and waterfront). - Room- Room Service was average....hot breakfast after a long night goes a long way. But it was NOT HOT enough. Major * faux pas* Room itself was basic, but again, extra points for the BEDS! - Amenities- Awesome gym complete with free weights and bosu ball. There is a sun deck off the gym too- which is perfect for a Seattlite in need of some vitamin D! NOTE If you sign in they will bill you $12.95/day. Let your conscience be your guide. Staff was always saying "Hello" and there was complimentary late check out @ 1pm instead of 10.
