I dined here recently and thought the food was alright and a good bang for your buck, but as I was looking up some info for Thanksgiving take-home turkeys for some friends of mine, I stumbled upon a Tribune article stating the restaurant's license is suspended because they failed to pass a surprise inspection from the Department of Public Health (which includes 2 serious violations and 4 minor violations). Yuck, blech. I hope they clean up their act. The Thanksgiving take-home turkeys were a fantastic idea, but it's disturbing to learn about their unsanitary ways.
