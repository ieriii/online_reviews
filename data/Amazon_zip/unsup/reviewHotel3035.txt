I was treated to the stay at the W for my birthday and really its everything I could have asked for. Our room was comfortable, intimate, and modern with an incredible panoramic view of the lake. Before we headed out for the night we took advantage of the mini bar and some of the goodies provided (a nice little spread to which tempts you to stretch your wallet even further), which was very relaxing.  We enjoyed dinner downstairs and indulged in their door service breakfast in the morning, both of which are quite pricey, but well worth it. Our doorman was even kind enough to bring us something for our hangovers when he saw the shape we were in in the morning.  The hotel merchandise is a bit much and a little tacky, but we had a great experience and I am sure we will be celebrating there in the future.
