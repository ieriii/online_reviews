Lively atmosphere. Friendly, helpful, sincere service. Food was ALL hot, fresh and excellently presented. Let's face it, with tapas there are lots of opportunities to goof up, but Mercat didn't. The boys enjoyed the beer selection, lamb, and tomato bread best.  Consider reservations if your party is over 2 people. It was really busy at 7:00 on a Monday!
