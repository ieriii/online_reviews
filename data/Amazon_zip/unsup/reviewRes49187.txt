This is totally one of those "we think we're super cool and trendy so we're going to make you wait even if there's no one here" type of restaurants. Everyone I encountered at this restaurant was totally rude and acted like they were doing me a favor by allowing me and my friends to dine at their establishment.  The waitress refused to take our order until everyone in our party had arrived, despite the fact that we said we would get started without the two people we were waiting for. Then she told us that we couldn't order wine separately from our meal because "the chef likes to make sure everything pairs well together." Ummm last time I checked, I got to pick what I eat and when... but apparently this restaurant didn't get the memo.  The food itself was tasty, but nothing to write home about. But a good meal once I got over the shoddy service that preceeded the arrival of my food. Overall, way way to snooty for my tastes. Good food, good wine, horrible service.
