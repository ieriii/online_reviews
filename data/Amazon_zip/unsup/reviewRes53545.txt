I'm eating as I type, and there is sauce all over my fingers and keyboard. It's the best sandwich I've ever had! THE FOODIE'S CHOICE CRISP is bursting with all of these amazing flavors. Given that my trip to Crisp was supposed to end with a small snack, saving the rest for later, I'm surprised to find that I just finished the whole thing. DELICIOUS! I'll be back!
