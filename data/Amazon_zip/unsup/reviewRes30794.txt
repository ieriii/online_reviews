Today was my first time at Mastro. From the minute we walked the staff was extremely courteous. We sat at a high top in the bar and were quickly greeted by Courtney. Being our first time there, she pointed out the different steaks and hve recommendations. You could tell the recommendations were legit And not just her pointing out steaks he was told to point out or the most expensive; there were honest answers. Her knowledge of the craft beer list also helped us to choose our drinks for the evening.  Her service was top notched and definately has me coming back in the future! Kudos to the entire staff for a wonderful time!
