OK I've eaten here three times now and I'm ready to review. It's good. Atmosphere is dark, so it's great for dates but also a great social place if you want to bring like 6 friends and share wine. I think they have a BYOB policy but I'm not totally sure. As for the food, the steak plates are around $18 or $20 depending what combination of skirt steak you want, be it with pork loin, chicken breast, calamari, octopus, etc. Most of the dishes come with yucca, plantain and sometimes roasted potato. People who I've been there have complained "the sides are so dry!"...well duh, you are supposed to smother the sides with the copious amounts of green chile they bring you, This is how Columbian food is eaten. I've tried some of the appetizers as well and they are very good, running like $3 to $8. The empanada sampler plate was a good deal. A single empanada order will run $2.50, but on this plate you get 6 of them for $7.50. Tonight was the first night I've been there in about 6 months, and I was saddened to learn that they got rid of having live latin music on Saturday nights because hoity toity clientele complained that it was noisy. If a Colombian lady singing traditional music in the corner of the bar with an acoustic and percussion backup is considered noisy to you, then you should probably gtfo and go elsewhere.
