A group of 5 of us, including a Chinese person who is a regular here, went to Lao Sze Chuan for lunch on a Sunday afternoon. After we had eaten and gotten the bill, our Chinese friend said she had gotten us a 10% discount, and yep, there it was right on the receipt. She just went up an asked for it, and I don't know if she got it for being Chinese, or speaking Chinese, or being a regular, or for just plain ballsiness, but maybe you should try it. Anyways, the food here is spectacular and I can easily see how this is considered the best Chinese restaurant in Chicago. The complimentary spicy cabbage is something every single restaurant should start meals with, bursting with flavor and giving your mouth something to do without filling you up. The dishes we split - Boiled beef in spicy sauce, Mapo tofu, Kung pao beef, Sichuan string beans and a mysterious, but delicious, chicken dish - were spectacular, with particular props to the spicy dishes. The Boiled beef, for example, packs a generous amount of equal parts heat and flavor, while the Mapo tofu really takes it home with such mouth-numbing spiciness that it's almost sour. The string beans provided a welcome respite for your mouth and the Kung pao beef and the chicken dish were both done right. And on top of all that, the price is reasonable and the chairs are weird!
