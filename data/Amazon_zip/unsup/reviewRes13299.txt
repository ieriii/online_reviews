Perfection! We went on a week day in late afternoon. No wait. Spouse has been there several times. I have to say this is one of the best meals I've had in my life. We ordered the gorgonzola garlic bread and crab cake for an appetizer. Scallops for me. Jambalaya for the spouse. Delightful waitress. Street parking. Don't think the casual atmosphere means casual food. This is serious food.
