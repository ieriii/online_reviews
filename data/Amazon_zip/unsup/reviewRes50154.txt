Now, I LOVE Southern food; with my family being from down South, I'm a de facto Southerner. But what bugs me about the rash of "neo-Southern" spots is that they charge too damned much for what is, in essence, the basics of Southern cooking. No way in bleep should I pay ANYTHING more than $5 for some fried green tomatoes, yet they dress em up and arrange them artistically on the damn plate, and can charge me more. Eff THAT. This place has good food, but it, and other places around the city interested in gaming you Yankees for your money, charges a shitload for what they give you.
