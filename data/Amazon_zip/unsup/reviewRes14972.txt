Dee W. wrote exactly how I felt about Sabatinos; adored The spinach soup & Wed. is the night to go for the lobster dinner special. If you go early try to get a booth, they are so cozy and will remove you from the hustle and bustle you might feel being out in the middle of the restaurant. I only went there once with my mom & my sister and we had a grand time. This is one of those places where the outside will give you a good indication of the decor on the inside (if you catch my drift). I would like to go back again, only if there's a booth guarantee.
