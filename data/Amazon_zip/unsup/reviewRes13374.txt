Quite enjoyed my meal - and our waitress was pretty great (shout out to Katie). My little dining group is not necessarily the brewing crowd (we don't really drink much beer) but we all ordered cider and enjoyed ourselves. For real though, no wait for a table (Wednesday night for the win), fast and friendly service, bacon covered popcorn? What else can you want? My burger was just a bit under done and too overwhelming (so much meat!). One of my companions loved her burger though. And for me, honestly, those garlic cream cheese mashed potatoes rocked my world and made any overwhelming burger worth it. My other companion got the pork belly and was disappointed with it (not enough of the actual pork belly/no real strong taste). I think she was more disappointed because she's had the twice baked potato pizza there in the past, loved it and was therefore sad not to be eating it. Would be happy to go back and eat here again.
