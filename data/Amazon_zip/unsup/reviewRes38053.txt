I was on vacation in Chicago for a few days this week, and insisted on real Chicago pizza. My partner suggested Giordano's. It was a Thursday night, so I couldn't believe the crowd that was there. I put my name in at the desk. She told me to order my pizza at the counter on the right in exactly 35 minutes. Then, by the time they had a table (probably 30 minutes later) my order came up. Damned if it wasn't true, just like she said. If not THE best stuffed (deep dish) pizza I've ever had, it's close. And service was very attentive when we got to our table. But standing in the middle of that crushing crowd was no fun. It's just a very popular place with a great system.
