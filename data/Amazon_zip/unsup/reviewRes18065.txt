Yep, 5 Stars!! While exploring North Center more and more, I've passed this place a couple times during casual bike rides and on the way to reserved dinners. The beer list itself is enough to come in any time, but what I had overlooked was the food menu, and boy is it delicious! First, like I said, the beer list is HUGE! They hand you what looks like a wine list...for a 5 star restaurant. BUT, most beers are actually under $6 which is pretty unreal. Now, for the food menu. There are about 7 sandwiches to choose from-vegetarian to meaty meat meat. These range from $7-$10 with a boat load of fries. The fries can be ordered in spicy chipotle, firecracker, curry, creole, or truffle for only .75 extra! We got an order or creole and spicy chipotle. Spicy chipotle was fantastic....get em'. I got the Tom Tom and the boo got the Hillbilly BBQ--which he devoured in about 3 bites. He even ate it WITH the sauerkraut. Impressive... As for the burgers, I saw about 100 come out, each one looking better and juicier. They marinate most burgers in some type of beer they pick, and add top ingredients like brie cheese, fried eggs, truffle mayo, butternut puree, morello cherry gastrique.... I mean, do you need me to go on to convince you even more?! Plain and simple, they know their burgers and ain't afraid to show it. They even have the Elvis- peanut butter '! Again, the same deal with the amazing mound of fries. You'll either have leftovers or you won't. You decide how to play it. All I'll say is, I ate ALL the fries, ate half of my big sandwich-but then finished it 3 hours later. I hope to get back to Bad Apple soon an have myself a burger with truffle fries- fo sho!
