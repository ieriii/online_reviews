Whether it's breakfast or dinner you are in the mood for, this is a must stop & eat place! With local artists' work hanging on the walls, I've never been disappointed with the food, or the service. Great for Saturday/Sunday mornings, or if you are sneaking an early lunch. Drink as much coffee as you like at this hidden gem.
