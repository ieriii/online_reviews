I live right by F & O and I think I'm going broke because of it. I'm here so often, either eating at the cafe or shopping their unique goods, that I should have a frequent purchaser card. The store itself is great because you can find amazing things, but the cafe is my favorite part. For breakfast definitely have the Cobb Omelet, it's so good and for lunch try the Roast Beef and Blue Brie sandwich - it's incredible.  Also, my guilty pleasure on the weekends is going to grab an ice coffee with soy. Whatever is in their coffee is addicting and so delish!
