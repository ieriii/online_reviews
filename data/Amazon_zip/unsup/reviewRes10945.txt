Oh, Piece! I have never been disappointed with the pizza here, no matter who I've brought along - from an eight-year-old cousin to my parents to my twenty-something friends. You can't go wrong with the spinach-artichoke dip to start - the best one I've had, including the one that I make. Pizza is thin and crispy and wonderful, and the microbrews are great - my favorite is the Top-Heavy Hefeweizen, but the Worryin' Ale and Dark Bier are yummy as well. Thursday night karaoke is a lot of fun to listen to, and you'll be surprised by how talented some of the patrons are!
