I visited for the first time last week. I had the guajirito sandwich and cafe con leche. The sandwich is the cousin of the Puerto Rican jibarito sandwich. It was very tasty. The coffee was excellent. The atmosphere extraordinary (we sat in the 4 season patio). The service fantastic. I enjoyed the old Cuban music---not too loud. The prices were very reasonable. I highly recommend this place. I will be returning.
