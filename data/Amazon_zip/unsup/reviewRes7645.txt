We were hoping to catch a great steak while in Chicago on business to celebrate a successful year. We were thinking that a place like Ruth's Chris would be great. But some of the top reviews were for Fogo de Chao. So we gave it a try. We couldn't have been more pleased. You may not find your best steak ever here, but you will find excellent steaks, chicken, chops and sausages combined with service that goes beyond your expectations. And you get to try some of each! The salad bar is simply the best ever...and to call it such is almost a disservice. It's far more than lettuce and dressing, laden with foods that are both exquisite and delightful. Their average of over 4 1/2 stars is well-deserved. For their unsurpassed service, they earn a 5 in my book. Can't wait to return here on my next trip to Chicago.
