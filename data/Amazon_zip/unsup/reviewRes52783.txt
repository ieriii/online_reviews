90 miles almost always has some pretty solid dishes....tasty, garlic-y, savory....they can be hit or miss though. I've been here enough times to know that every once and a while I will be disappointed - whether with the service or the food.  That being said, they have always seemed to pride themselves on being BYOB with no corkage fees. It even says so on their menus. BYOB - no corkage fees!  That has changed. It is now $3 for a six pack, and I am not sure how much the wine is but that has a corkage fee as well. I hate to sound entitled, but why? Why pride yourself on something like that, have REPEAT customers come there and then be told that we now have to pay a corkage fee. On top of that, they've raised their prices significantly in the past 2 years.  I am not in the restaurant business, but I do understand a few things. Yes, food prices go up. However, nowhere else I go has raised their prices as much as 90 miles has (relative to their old prices).  Yes, people take advantage of BYOB and hang around to finish off their bottle of wine or 6 pack. So...charge those people the corkage fee. There's got to be a better way. I left 90 miles tonight satisfied with my food, but dissatisfied about the road they have been heading down. You are better off going down the road to Chilapan. Unless they now have corkage fees as well...
