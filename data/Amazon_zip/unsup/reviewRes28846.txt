If you can forget how excruciatingly SLOW the servers are here and just focus on the food, OH MY GOD - IT'S LOVE. The food comes piping hot and I highly suggest the bami moo daeng (boiled egg noodles with BBQ pork, green onions and ground peanuts, lime, served dry instead of as a soup). And if you're a fan of spicy, ask for it spicy. Their Tom Ka Kai is also one of the best I've had. As far as appetizers are concerned the satay and crab rangoon are safe bets. Parking isn't too difficult if you drive, there are parking meters. However, it's only a few blocks away from the Western Brown line if you want to save yourself the trouble.
