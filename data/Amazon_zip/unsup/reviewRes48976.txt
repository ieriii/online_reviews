I was really torn what to rate Publican. On the one hand, some of the food was insanely good - the smoked trout was unbelievable, and the pork belly amazing. Some food was pretty good - the ribs were good, but overcooked (although the flavor made up for the slightly tough texture), the ham was good, but I have had better, and the oysters were good, but only insofar as they were good for Chicago standards. I suppose my biggest beef was the price - the food was good, but local produce should be good and flavorful - but the mark-up was insane. What let them down the most, though, was the service - absolute, total incompetent crap service. Our server ignored us for most of the night and when he did bother with us (we were a table of 10) he had us confused - we had worked out what we were going to share and what we were not, and told him so, yet he kept asking "for the table or for yourself" and "the man over there already ordered that." He also took 3 orders and left, and we had to go after him to tell him that 3 orders for 10 people was not sympatico. Then when the food came out it was a disaster - the dude who brought it to the table stood at the end whispering (literally!) "who had the oysters", when I said I didn't know, he'd have to ask up the table he just stood there and then loaded the food all in front of me! My husband also had to order his drink 3 times before it turned up. Publican - work it out - you have the potential to be good, don't screw it up with screwy servers. I won't be going back for a while that's for sure.
