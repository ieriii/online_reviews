as far as chinese food goes, this is some of the best i've found. that said, there were still some disappointing dishes here. skip the egg rolls and cashew chicken, both were very unexciting.  the sesame chicken, szechuan beef and crab rangoon were all good. i'd go back but try other items and ask for recommendations.
