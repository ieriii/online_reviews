Second time I've eaten here and I was happy to have hit a new menu so it was a somewhat new experience. But, it's kind of like going to a Cirque Du Soleil show. There are only so many ways an asian woman can contort her spine and there are only so many ways one can splash dessert all over a table cloth. Seen one, you've seen them all. I definitely recommend the elite/high-end wine pairing. Some rather exceptional wines from small producers all over. Like watching the sequel to any movie, it's just not as good as the original, because the element of surprise is not there. But, once in your life time... for sure. Do it. And buy the recipe book so you can see all the wonderful things you can't possibly create without upgrading your entire kitchen.
