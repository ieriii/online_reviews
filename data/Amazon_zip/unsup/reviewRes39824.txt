Awwww shoooooot! I'm floored. This place is epic. I went here with a group of friends. There were seven of us and we knew, it being a smaller setting, that it would take us quite some time to get sat. It did (almost two hours). So what do we do in all that time? Oh yeah! Get sloshed at the fantastic bar!!! I had a Lion's Pride Rye Whiskey Manhattan. It was my first time trying Lion's Pride and I was really excited about it. It was, of course, delicious. The bartenders over there are amazing. Expect to wait for your drink. Expect to be glad you did. I also had a glass of wine the bartender recommended and a couple beers they vouched for. All great picks. Then came the meal. WOWZAHS!!! I was blown away. We just ordered a bunch of stuff and ate it, family style, with a couple of bottles of wine for the table. Here are some of the highlights: House Marinated Olives Mallard Pate Pretzel Artisanal Cheese Selection Seared Foie Gras Veal Sweetbread Tete du Cochon Roasted Marrow Bones I think it was at about this time that I blacked out and went into a foodanddrinkcoma (the technical term, I'm sure). Seriously ridiculously delicious food. The service was impeccable, the atmosphere fantastic. I CAN'T WAIT to go back!
