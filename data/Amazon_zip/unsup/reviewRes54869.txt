Great bar, very chill, you can actually hear people when they talk. Beer is expensive but amazing and Belgian beer has twice the alcohol content of American beer so it evens out. Food is great (try the mussels) you can usually find seats at the bar if not a table (if you go fairly early). I have had an excellent time every time ive gone.
