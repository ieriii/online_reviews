The best deep-dish in the city. Period. A crust that rarely gets left on the plate, mountains of cheese and some of the better sauce I've had the chance to taste. I'd definitely recommend this one. If you're not feeling pizza, try their cheesy beef sandwich. You'll love it once you figure out how the hell you're actually going to eat the monstrosity.
