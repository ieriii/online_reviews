I love this place, I have been going here since I was nine (possibly younger). This place use to be just a tiny shack. The family that owns it is very friendly. There are a few things that set this place part from other places. 1. They have to most amazing shakes, I have tried almost all the flavors and like everyone else says the oatmeal shake is to die for. 2. If you have never had yucca this is the place to get it. It is similar to a potato, here they either fry it in garlic or boil it and either way I can never get enough of it. 3. If your a fan of plantains you should definitely order some here, I don't usually like plantains but I will occasionally get them here. My mom loves them.  This place had a good vibe, but sometimes parking can be a little difficult to get.
