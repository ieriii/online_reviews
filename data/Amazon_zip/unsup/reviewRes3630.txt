I saw this place as it was under construction, and couldn't wait for it to open; there is a serious lack of good Korean food in the lakeview area. I like the mix of more traditional dishes with some creative fare. The Buddah bowls, Seoul Sensation (burrito), and Not so Common Crisp (chicken sandwich) are all great. Friendly and quick service only add to Crisp's appeal. Only negative is that it's closed on Mondays! Highly recommended for some good quick eats.
