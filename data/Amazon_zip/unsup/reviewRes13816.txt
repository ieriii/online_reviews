Tried this place out last night. I had the Workingman Mild and a Eugene and both were excellent. My fiance had Bottom Up and tried the Wee Heavy, both of which he really liked. We ordered food and sat at the bar since there was already a wait for a table. Fiance had the smokehouse burger, which he loved, and I had the cheese soup (A+ would eat again) and the tempeh reuben, which I did not like(super bland). I brought it up to the bartender at the end of our meal since I figured they're a new place and would appreciate the feeback and the manager came over, thanked me, and comp'd ALL of our drinks! She mentioned that they're still working out some of the recipes and are hoping to get changes made. Either way, the beer was excellent, the service was amazing (bartender even "homemade" us the best honey mustard on the spot) and the fact that they took into account my feedback made a world of difference. We will definitely be back.
