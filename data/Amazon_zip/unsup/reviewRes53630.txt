Really!?!? Best chicken in America by Yahoo? I mean, it was pretty good, but I guess a little overrated if you're saying BEST fried chicken. I tried the Seoul Sassy as well as the original. Their wings are HUGE which I liked, but my friend didn't. Smaller = juicier wings?? I don't agree. Anyway wings by themselves are definitely a 4 star rating. However, their Buddha bowl leaves a little to be desired. I know its a fusion type restaurant, but I suppose I'm just used to the kind in the stone bowls served hot with the rice all crispy on the edges! Also the service was meh. Overall, 3 star rating. If you like wings, go thy them here. They're good, but don't expect to be wowwwwed.
