great pizza joint. not your typical chicago-style ... this pizzeria specializes in some great thin pizzas. i personally prefer this to chicago-style. in the words of a local, "you can't go wrong" here with the build-your-own-pizza. a large and a medium were enough to fit a mixed crowd of 7 hungry twentysomethings. prices are pretty darn good. beer selection isn't great. they appear to feature more light beers and IPA's. the one dark beer (named "dark bier") was also pretty darn good. great atmosphere for groups. it was a bit loud, but it was fitting. i'd like to return the next time i have a random group of people to hang out with in chi-town. recommended.
