The serving staff at this place is rude to the core. If you're not ordering multi orders of BBQ and alcohol, forget about service. You're totally looked down upon if the amount of your order isn't over $200. Not being attended by your server even once during your entire meal is common. Also note and beware, the food from this place is a MSG galore. You can taste it in your tongue. Very nasty after taste.
