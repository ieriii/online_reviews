Eating food so slow only allows me to eat more! My wife took me here for our four year anniversary. Fondue is a good time for any special occasion. Geja's was by far the best fondue I have ever had. I have only ever been to the melting pot, and I liked Geja's way better. The main difference is the oil. Geja's has hot oil instead of broth. Broth is for soup as fas as I am concerned and doesn't do much for the food. Also, Geja's has some great dipping sauces that take thier food to next level.  Just a side note,but while we were eating our desert course Ron Howard sat down at a table next to us. Kinda coo!!!!  Great place for a special occasion and if you are lucky maybe you will see a celebrity!
