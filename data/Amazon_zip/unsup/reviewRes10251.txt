My brother and I are a couple of New Jersey transplants, and loathe the pizza options in Chicago. Just thinking about a slice of real NJ pizza makes me homesick. And when I'm homesick, I'll go to Piece! The best pizza I've had in Chicago, aside from Boiler Room. Prices are reasonable, and even when it's crazy busy, good service.
