Not that this place needs another review - I still thought I'd add my 2 cents.  Disclaimer: Even though I'm a born-and-raised Chicagoan, I don't eat deep dish or pan pizza. If I wanted that, I'd get a calzone. I'm strictly a thin crust girl. So this review is only for their thin crust. Pequod's is in the top 3 places in the Chicago area for pizza. (#1 pizza ever is Papa Del's in Champaign). Their sauce is a little thick, but other than that, the overall package of crust, sauce and toppings is near perfection. The crust even acts as a little handle for eating! When going, make sure to have a reservation or be prepared to wait. And put your order in when you check in. I will say the bar staff is less than friendly, and the waiters all seem mostly overwhelmed (but do their best to keep it together), but the place isn't packed every night for the service. Must try for anyone coming to Chicago!
