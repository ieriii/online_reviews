I love Sultan's! Especially this location. Everyone is SO friendly, and the food is amazing. $3.75 for a falafel? Perfect. The lentil soup is to die for as well, went there yesterday because I had missed how delicious it was. Everyone should check out the new additions they have made, they just added a new wing to the restaurant with really beautiful tiled floors. Anyway, Sultan's is the place to go, and if you opt for delivery, make sure you are calling the right location. (Also, this place is A+ for the munchies)
