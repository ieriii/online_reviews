Great beer selection, and I love the CB&J. Often a long wait for a seat in the restaurant, and we've had mediocre table service. We prefer to sit in the bar when possible. Had a very bad experience recently: I've been going here for years, but was turned away at the door this past week because the person carding at the door thought my Illinois Driver's license looked suspicious.  My boyfriend, sister, and I intended to come in for dinner. Nevermind that I'm 31, and not super-young looking. I am rarely carded, not at Green Zebra last night, Ombra Friday night, or any of the other establishments I've spent money at recently. A reasonable person would not question whether I'm of drinking age, and anyway I have a legal state driver's license, which was good enough for TSA the times I've traveled by air in the past month. Why does Hopleaf have someone carding at the door? What other similar gastropubs have that practice? This is not a young person's bar - my boyfriend's 72 year old father loves this place and a lot of the patrons are his peers.  The guy at the door - in his attempt to explain to me that the fact that I don't appear to be under 21 was not a factor - told me that he's seen 35 year olds who look younger than me. Suffice it to say, overall this was just a really negative experience and left a bad taste. Again, love the heavy comfort food and so many beer options, but with so many other options in the area (where staff are welcoming) I probably won't come back here.
