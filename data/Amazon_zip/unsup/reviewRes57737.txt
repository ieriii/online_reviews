The chilaquiles are so good that I dream about them. And the scones are even dreamier! I lived in the neighborhood and was a weekend regular. I have since moved away, but try to visit every time I am in town. When my last visit didn't coincide with a weekend, I wrote to the manager, who said she would arrange to have the chilaquiles (a weekend-only menu item) made especially for me! This kind of service, along with the great food and comfortable atmosphere, is what keeps me coming back. Thank you, Third Coast!
