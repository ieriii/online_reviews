I like to go out. My partner likes to stay home and read. What's the perfect compromise? Wilde's! A library within a bar within a restaurant...yes please!  I'm loving Wilde's brunch...I had the omelette and why-oh-why didn't I try the much-hyped bloody mary at Wilde's? Every table there had copious amounts of glasses with red stuff and celery.... Love Wilde's....for their laid-back style, their library, and their food. Such a great restaurant in Lakeview.
