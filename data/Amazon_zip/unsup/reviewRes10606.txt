I crave this pizza every single day. It hurts my feelings that they don't deliver to my area of Lincoln Park. I would even pay them extra to bring that yummy cheese creation over to my apartment. Hands down, the best pizza in the city..even though my boss Scott disagrees! My ex introduced me to this place a couple years ago and ever since then I was hooked. I get the same thing every time, red sauce with pepperoni and sausage extra crispy. That sauce..is....so....TASTY!!! Go there for their beer too, it's rather tasty. I'm a huge fan of their Golden Arm, which is a German-style Kolsch Bier. Something else that brings me into the bar is their Karaoke every Thursday night @ 10:00 pm. Who wants to pass up a chance to make an idiot out of themselves...or watch other people act a fool. Other than that, the layout of the space is rather boring and boxy. The bathrooms are always very clean and the staff is always attentive and helpful. I have no gripes here. The live entertainment every now and then is fun to watch too. I will say that their advertisements are pretty annoying. On one last note: Try the pizza because I just know you will love it.
