Love this Hotel!!! I had spent and evening with a Bachlorette party here years ago and beside the $40 parking fee I loved it so much that I had to return. So just recently my love and I ate at their restaurant. It was super great. Outdoor seating on the river, booth table, great food, and exceptional drinks. I felt fancy and 2 classes above my rank. My fav drink was the tequila martini.....oh la la it was damn good. Best martini I've ever, ever had and I was a bartender. So there. My love had beers and appetizers, I mostly drank my dinner and munched a bit on the meat and cheese platter and shrimp appetizer. The setting is perfecto. Seriously if your gonna bring your date and your A game this is where you do it. This is where the magic can and will happen. Now it gets pricey but sometimes that's cool with me, with the surroundings and drinks Hotel 71 gives, I'd do it weekly if I could.
