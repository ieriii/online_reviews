We made reservations to dine in the garden. However, it turned out to be one of those Chicago days when the temp was in the upper 90s and we called to cancel, presuming it would be unbearable to eat outside. It was disappointing to have to do so since the garden is one of the most charming places in all of Chicago's restaurants and a delight when the weather is bearable. Graciously, the maitre said he could accommodate us indoors. We accepted. The food was great, the service delightful. That part of dinner lived up to our expectations. What the maitre did not say was that indoors WAS NOT AIR CONDITIONED. We could have eaten in the garden for all the difference it would have made. Not to have informed us that there was no AC indoors (something that we took for granted) was a very bad business since we made it clear that "heat" was an issue. Two of our guests were truly uncomfortable to the point of feeling ill and certainly not able to enjoy their dinners We have really enjoyed this restaurant and were so disappointed to have to literally sweat through dinner. My star rating reflects this faux pas on the part of the maitre. We will go back but never when the temperature is stifling. That is, unless they air condition the indoors.
