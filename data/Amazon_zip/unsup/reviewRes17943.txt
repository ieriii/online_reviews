Don't go expecting cost effective dining. Tis a bit on the pricey side. Or excellent decor. The dining room setup looked a little cheesy. What is UP with all the plants in the window?  GO FOR THE FOOD. It's divine. The gnocchi with bolognese smothered in melted cheese is insanely good. The portion is ginormous with plenty of food for dinner and about two meals after that. What I didn't like was the pricing. $20+ for a plate of pasta? For serious? We're in a little out-of-the-way nook in Ravenswood, not River North. BYOB, though. That's cool.
