Fabulous Brunch! Went with the family last Sunday. Had the following: Scottish egg - The sausage was phenomenal. Soo juicy and garlicky. Perfectly fried. Totally rejuvenated by fascination with Scotish eggs. Irish Bacon - Duh..so good. I think they dry-age their bacon, or something like that. It tasted a little more cured than usual - a little saltier - in a good way. Bangers - Remarkably juicy, yet light. House-made, apparently. These people know their sh*t. Dutch Pancake w/bananas - I could eat this everyday and die happy. Soft, cinnamony baked pancake. Dense, yet light. Basically, they took the perfect Dutch pancake and poured bananas foster on top. Twas a thing of beauty. Please open a pub in SF. Thanks!
