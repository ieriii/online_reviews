Naples style pizza. Individual pies per person. Fresh ingrediants and nothing like any other pizza places. Very soft and chewy! Spumoni ice cream is so good. Only thing that sucked was they forgot to put my order in; however, a person I was dining with told us that it only takes 90 seconds to make (cuz the stone burning oven is so hott!) It came out fast!
