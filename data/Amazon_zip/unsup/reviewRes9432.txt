I don't think this place is going to make it. I've been here twice for dinner in the past month and both experiences were sub par. The food itself is not bad but it's not worth the price. I don't know if Dale is actually back there in the kitchen but whoever it is either isn't tasting the food or they have a cold or something. On this last visit, I got the "Foie Gras" dish. I knew going into that it was not actually a piece of foie gras but in fact mousse. But I didn't think that the dish would include banana and walnut bread and actual bananas. First of all, foie gras mousse is a scam. It's just a way to stretch out foie gras and make more profit and if the rest of the dish doesn't go with it, it's a waste. I asked for a cocktail pairing because the wine pairings at the last meal were completely incoherent. Typically with foie you would expect a sweet wine so I was expecting something along those lines. They gave me an Aviation, an acidic cocktail of gin, lemon juice and maraschino. So that sucked. Plus it was right off the menu and I was expecting something more creative. And that's how the whole meal goes when you eat there. Although that cheese sandwich and cider is good. They should just stick with that. There was a completely bland puree of cauliflower and thyme as in intermezzo in there somewhere. The main was rabbit which was very good but again the cocktail paring made no sense and was right off the menu. Desert was decent but could have used less curry. And the place was completely quiet after 10:30. This place will be gone before the year is over. So go for just food or just a cocktail. And go if you are a fan of Top Chef like me. But don't expect this place to stand up to any of the other great restaurants in Chicago.
