I agree with the previous reviews of this establishment that I have read. The waitress was, uh, shall we say slow? We didn't have their pizza. One of my son's ordered the meatball sandwich. (aside from the service he didn't complain). My other son had Salad with chicken added. He hated it. Thought the lettuce was soggy, and the chicken had no discernable taste to it. I ordered the Turkey sandwich. I didn't think mine was esp bad. But really, non-descript. If you just want to go to a bar and watch a sporting event and drink beer. This is a five star place. (because by the end of the game, you won't give a care how the service was)
