Great place if you like to feel rushed and practically kicked out after a short meal. The staff is annoying in the sense that they are busy (I know, we are all busy; but I expect some common courtesy when I choose your establishment to spend my money). The food is ok, nothing special. The atmosphere is cramped due to the fact that the whole "restaurant" is smaller than a studio apartment. Be prepared to move a lot to accommodate others, loud ambiance, annoyed staff, and mediocre food.  * I have been here a few times, but during my last visit (a second date btw) we were sitting at the bar and one of the staff had the balls to ask us to give up our seats because another customer was tired of standing. I should have requested my check back and crossed out the generous 25% tip i left. Unprofessional and extremely discourteous. I will never go back.
