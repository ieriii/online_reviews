The food is absolutely disgusting no flavor at all! Can't believe I actually sat there with a smile and paid for this meal. I'm still mad and it was over two weeks ago. Have they heard of a little thing called garlic? Man my fianc wouldn't even eat it and she will eat anything, ended up giving it to the dog. Don't waste your money!
