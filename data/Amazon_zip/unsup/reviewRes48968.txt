After dining at this restaurant, I came away with one conclusion: don't believe in the hype. Went there on my 32nd birthday, and after spending over 100 bucks on the dinner, we came away disappointed. The ambiance was great, very trendy both in location and setting.  Loved the bathroom set up, the fountain hand wash sink was awesome! The wait staff was friendly and they were , really knowledgable about their beer menu which could be overwhelming. If you ever want to drink a 70 dollar botthle of beer, the publican is the place to do it.  The food was good but unspetacular. serrano ham and peasant bread was ok, but the ham was entirely too salty, they did give you quite a lot of ham, but with only two pieces of bread, the ham was too much to consume, we asked for more bread but it was delivered too slow. eating the ham turned from enjoyment to suffering pretty quickly, The mussels were good, but not great, but it was the best dish of the night. The main dish, the roasted pork belly, the dish that Anthony Bourdain and other national celebrity chefs raved about was probably the most disappointing dish of the night, it was fatty, which was expected for the cut of the meat, but they managed to over cooked the meat and left the meat tough at the same time. Chewing the tough fat was just a textual disaster. I actually took the meat home, sliced it thin the next day and stir fry with scallions and ginger, and it turned out pretty good.  the side dish the cauliflower au-gratin was great, best 8 dollars ever spent.  Overall, the service was decent, but the food was left a lot to be desired, i don't know if the chef just had a bad night, but with the pricey menu, it will take a long time for me to regain the confidence to give it another try.
