I wasn't wowed by Davanti Enoteca. I like Francesca's on Tayler and would recommend that spot for dinner over Davanti Enoteca. While waiting for a table (Davanti doesn't take reservations), I started with a cocktail. The Acai Fizz ($9) tasted along the lines of cough syrup. Skip this. Friday around 7pm the wait for a two top was less than 40 minutes, which was nice. For food, I ordered the Linguine with Sea Urchin and Crab. This was good, but while I liked this dish, for $13 I can get an equally good pasta dish from Francesca's that's twice the size. I also ordered the Pizza with Foraged Mushrooms, Braised Leeks, Taleggio, and Truffle Oil ($11). This pizza involves components with bold flavors, but somehow it tasted bland. Finally, there was the Grilled Half Chicken with Chili Paste ($14). Nothing wrong with this dish, but the roast chicken at Francesca's with white wine sauce and roasted potatoes is tastier. The service was friendly. Food arrived quickly. Bussers worked rapidly. The room feels small and cramped. The noise level verges on loud. The prices are generous, but the flavor isn't there. Head across the street to Francesca's on Taylor instead. It's better.
