Having already experienced 1 disgusting meal and 2 overpriced mediocre meals in Chicago, I wasn't about to take any more chances. I've been to this particular Le Colonial several times and the Le Colonial in SF several times. Historically speaking, both locales have proven to be memorable affairs.  The food is tasty, but by no means authentic French Vietnamese. (I can say this because I am French Vietnamese and have had the pleasure of consuming this particular food fare my entire life.) Most of the menu items do retain some of the right flavors/spices, but they have been (as expected) very "white-washed". My parents would freak if they knew I was paying these prices for pseudo-French Vietnamese cuisine!! Well, off the French Vietnamese soap box I go.  I don't really come here in search of authentic FV. Mostly, I come for the lively atmosphere. They serve up a mean Appletini and usually there's great mix of hip urban locals and travelers. History did not repeat itself this visit, however. Food was the same, but the place was sedate, at best. There was not even a single martini-sipping soul upstairs on a Friday night. I guess everyone's discovered that this is not authentic French Vietnamese.
