I have been going here for years. They continually win me over with the food and excellent service. I typically don't order pasta out - it's usually not good enough for me to justify all of those carbs, but here I happily make an exception. One time, there were a bunch of us for a birthday dinner and we were the last table in an otherwise empty restaurant. The staff did not rush us and we felt comfortable staying and enjoyed a great dinner experience. Last time I had the gnocchi special that was out of this world! Finally, it's a BYOB with no corkage fee!!
