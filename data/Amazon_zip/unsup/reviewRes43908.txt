Super small menu. Pretty standard stuff. Nothing fancy. Boring egg, bacon, tomato, cheddar panini...served with (get this) potato chips! Ick. Not something I want to eat for breakfast. Also had the chocolate and strawberry pancakes which were tasty but not exceptional. My boyfriend and I felt like we could have easily made this breakfast at home.
