So we generally head to Devon when we need an Indian cuisine fix. Both my boyfriend and I lived in Rogers for years and we love the variety of great Indian restaurants along Devon. You can understand why we would be hesitant to check out an Indian restaurant downtown. It was a gift certificate that brought us to Grand Ave. this past Friday night, and wow, were we ever so pleasantly surprised. We were seated immediately, given water and some nan to munch on while we tried to navigate through the behemoth menu. Although we're fairly comfortable with Indian cuisine the sheer size of the menu was intimidating. So as I usually do in these types of situations, I asked our server for his recommendation. I told him that we love seafood and some spice/heat. He recommended the shrimp masala and the tandoori salmon. Lord have mercy, the salmon was AMAZING! We were served four large sizzling fillets of absolutely perfectly cooked salmon. The flavor was incredible. There was so much of it that we had to take the shrimp curry home! The tandoori salmon is probably one of the best Indian dishes I have ever had. It is a MUST TRY! Also, as a side note, the restaurant itself made for a nice romantic evening without being too formal. Bring your friends (or your sweetie) for a great night out downtown and some awesome Indian food! PS - Side note two. Skip the dinner salad and go for one of the soups. The salad is literally just a small house salad with French dressing.
