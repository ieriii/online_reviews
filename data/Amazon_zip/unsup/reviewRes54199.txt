After living in Bucktown for awile I decieded to try this Costa Rican resturant.. The only one in Chicago.. :-(  So I had to try it .. First of all Its a long wait. This place is small . You would think with all the buisness they have they would expand. So they turned thier parking lot into a outdoor patio. Still a long wait, and Is this even legal. Is it so thier property taxes do not go up. They do not take credit cards, but they have a ATM right there. Another way to make money from you, and screw the IRS too. You get charged a fee that they make out of it. Now thier prices are high for Costa rican food. I dont respect buisnesses that do this. Its a way to take your hard working money from you. Now for the food. The oatmeal drink is a latin thing. I drink it every morning when im in PR . Everybody gives great reviews about it. The food is bland. Its more like a high end Mexican resturant. The Horchata was watered down. I had two tacos and a empanda . My friend had the steak, rice, and beans plate. They only gave him three tortias with his plate and a extra 3 was a 1 extra dollar. Plus it was a small serving for the price. Comon not everybody is Donald Trump ...........I was not impressed with this place at all and this place is not inexpensive. Unless you share a burrito. Last thing . I was told by a Costa Rica coworker that this is not the realy deal and most of the Costa rican people dont go there to eat. I didnt beleave it, but now I do. Thanks for reading my opinion on this place...
