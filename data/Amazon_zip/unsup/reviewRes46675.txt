This place was good... a great place to bring parents who are scared of non-traditional food. I'm not sure why everyone is going nuts about the salad bar... it's a salad bar, I didn't find it that special. The music was WAY too loud and WAY lame, which put a damper on both the conversation and the mood. I don't need to hear Chantilly Lace twice at a high volume when I'm having an $80 dinner. The service was great, and when we told our server we'd never been there before, she brought us a free dessert, hence the 4-star rating.
