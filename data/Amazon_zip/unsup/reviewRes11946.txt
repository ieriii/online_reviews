I've only been to the Bongo Room once, and I'll never go back. Their pancakes are good, but the whole restaurant is completely overrated. The service was rude from the onset. The manager that greeted us at the door was curt & incredibly unwelcoming. It was an hour long wait for a table for 4. We got seated at 2pm, and were then informed that the kitchen closed at 2, and had to order immediately. The food came at different times, and yes it was good, but not good enough to go back. My friend asked for extra sauce (as she always does), and for some reason today, they decided to charge her for it. Before we were even 1/2 way through our meal, our waitress brought us our bill, and began rushing us out. When we asked if we could split our bill, she said 'no', that she wasn't allowed to do that, because 'there are rules'. What was intended to be a relaxing and enjoyable brunch out with the ladies, became a waste of $67, and a solid two THUMBS DOWN to the Bongo Room.
