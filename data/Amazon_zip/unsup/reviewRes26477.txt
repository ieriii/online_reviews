Very friendly service. I thought the waiter was going to sit down and eat with us at one point. As usual Chicago is freezing balls, so we went out for Pho and some tea, the tea was good, really how bad can tea be? The Pho was solid, I had been craving it since my departure from California, and found this place which is in a lively area of Chicago. The prices were good too, $6.50, and the place was clean and quick. Argyle street has a ton of Pho, but is a bit further out of downtown.
