The Hotel Allegro is located right in the midst of Chicago's theatre district - smack next door to the Cadillac Palace Theatre -offering convenience and easy access to downtown culture and the performing arts. Within a short walking distance are the Oriental, Chicago, Schubert, and Goodman Theatres - they had a cute bar attached to it. I was there right before we saw the Lion King next door and my group enjoyed the drinks and eats.
