Our party of five got there early (just after five on Saturday and had a short 20 minute wait). They had a lot of two tops. So if you are going to go in a group of four or more, it looks like you'd be wise to go early if you don't want to wait. We were seated in the back room, which was significantly quieter than the main room where the hungry masses were waiting. The patio wasn't open but looked like it would be pleasant, as it is on the residential Schubert.  Excellent, well mixed cocktails. The whiskey (mostly American styles) list is one of the most extensive I've seen. The wine list is comparatively shorter but well thought out with a bottle for almost every budget. The food was excellent. It was one of the better dining experiences I've had. Our server was knowledgeable about the menu and friendly, but not overly so. The courses were well timed and well portioned. The flavor combinations on all the dishes were extremely well balanced. The deserts were creative and just killer. The menu seems to change regularly as it was significantly different than what was posted on their website.  My only small complaint is that the drink service was not quite as quick as I would have liked. It wasn't terribly slow but long enough that I had enough time to wonder where my cocktail was. In fairness, the bar was very busy with people waiting for tables. But the overall service/food quality was so good that I would only take off 1/4 or 1/8 of a star. One last caveat is that the tables are fairly close together and some of the tables in the main dining room are close to the bar/main walkway. If you are uptight about human contact or talking to your neighboring diners, this is not the place for you.
