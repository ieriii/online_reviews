This place is alright. The live band karaoke on Saturday nights is cool. The pizza looked good (and I've heard is pretty amazing, though I haven't yet had it myself). The beer is pretty tasty. And the atmosphere is interesting. Looks like a fancy-pants, hip Wicker Park bar. Interesting group of people. I described it as "a hint of Wrigley in a sea of hipsters." There were cool, nice people. There were your typical douche-bags. There were some awful freaking karaoke singers who need to not mock the activity while they are doing it. Oh well. The service was atrocious and my friend and I sat right at the freaking bar. Wednesday Addams apparently thought that we didn't need to be checked up on. So I had to be loud and obnoxious to flag all the bartenders down the whole night. And that just doesn't fly when my buzz is wearing off. So overall its a pretty cool place. Fun on Saturday nights. Just steer clear of the bartender that looks like Emily the Strange.
