Stopped in there last week and really wanted to like it. If you're into actual hard rock and good food go to Kumas. If you're into an authentic bar that isn't trying way too hard to tell everyone how cool they are go down the street to Five Star on Chicago (or Happy Village in the Summer). If you're a d-bag who wasn't able to get into Cans then this is your place. A hokey "prison" theme would be hysterical if they weren't serious. This is more like a "hard rock bar" (Nickelback?!) you would find at Epcot Center than something that should be in a great neighborhood like Wicker Park / West Town. Food is way too average to swallow your pride and risk being seen in this wanna-be something. Plenty of other options in the neighborhood.
