I tend to like Italian style pizza over Chicago or any other American pizza and this is the real deal. Sit outside if you can because the chairs inside are the most uncomfortable things I've ever experienced anywhere. They are made of wicker or some type of wood frame and they offer no back support whatsoever and they dig into your thighs if you don't have a lot of natural padding. Also, if you are a smoker, beware! They are very serious about not smoking even outdoors, and they will make you walk down the block to smoke. Now that the negatives are out of the way, I have mostly good things to say about the delicious fresh food. The pizza with sausage and mushrooms is to die for and the crust is so good you will want to eat every bite(if they don't burn it), Also, the fresh buffalo mozarella with tomato and basil is very good but maybe a little lite on the tomatoes. The house sparkling white wine is great on a nice sunny day or warm evening and the staff and owner are very friendly. It's nice to have a reliably good place like this within walking distance. This is good but Pizza DOC just a few blocks away may be even better and has a bigger selection.
