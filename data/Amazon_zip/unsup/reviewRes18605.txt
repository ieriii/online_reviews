Love xoco! I've been a handful of times, and it's never a disappointment. It's a satisfying meal, meaning you won't leave hungry. Well priced and amazing dishes. I highly recommend it if you don't mind waiting. They also have yummy desserts, homemade churros and different types of rich hot chocolates! Yum, can't wait to go back during the colder months.
