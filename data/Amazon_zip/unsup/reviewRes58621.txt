Still so full as I type this from dinner tonight. This was my second time at Geja's. The food is just oh so yummy! I really think I'll go in next time and just start with the chocolate fondue because it is definitely my fave!  The first time I went to Geja's, I wasn't too happy with the service. While the hostess was going to seat us, a waitress went up to her and said don't seat them in my section. I don't want another table. Ive been a waitress so I get having bad nights, but really? Right in front of me? Someone must have called her out after because she came to apologize but the damage was done. Good thing we didn't get sat with her. Our server, who was awesome, got a really good tip! Only reason Geja's is missing one star is for that rude server.Today was no problem. Typically, you need reservations to come in but we walked in and crossed our fingers. The hostess was very nice and said to give her 10 minutes so we went to the bar for a quick drink and we were promptly sat.Again, from start the finish the food is awesome. We had the Prince Geja's combination which is just that, a combination of everything. Can't go wrong with this! Steak, chicken, scallops, shrimp, lobster, and yummy veggies and awesome dipping sauces. Time for a nice long walk after that awesome dinner! Thank you!
