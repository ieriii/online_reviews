Tried to order a B-day cake, went online to look at designs for the cake and found one that I liked. I noted the name of the cake and tried to order the cake over the phone. The person from the bakery had no clue what cake is online and was told to go online to order the cake or come in. Later that night, I went by the bakery and the person in the bakery said that the internet is down and should come back the next day or call. The next day I called the bakery and the baker said that he does not know what cake is shown online or had any pictures of the cake online. Bottom line-The cake I've wanted was not the cake I received and does not look like the cake described online. The cake was too sweet and was dry.
