Not a bad place. Went here with my girlfriend at 1a.m. or so and got some hot dogs. We both like our hot dogs, but I think most of the reason you go here is for the nostalgic feeling about the place. It's a fun retro drive-in where you sit in your car, order at the kiosks, and then wait for the waiters to bring you your food on a tray that hangs off of your windows. It's quite fun actually and I'd recommend it to anyone. However, I cannot give it more than three stars because I paid $20 for two hot dogs and one shake. I'm sorry, but that seems way too expensive. I like a good sausage and cool ambiance, but I don't like being over-charged for food that is fairly standard American fare. Anyway, not to end on a drab note, but go here and have fun stepping back in time for a bit, just don't look at your bank statement for a few days.
