Excellent, authentic, convenient Costa Rican food. I was in CR two years ago and they may do the food even better here - not in the Amercanized-add-some-fried-and-fatty-stuff sense, but in the authentic-flavorful-filling sense. Dining area is wooden tables and quite casual, but if that's cool for your plans it's a great environment with friendly staff and great energy.
