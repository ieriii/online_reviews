Great place...love the decor and the tasting menu was interesting with southern touches and excellent presentation. A steal for only $24. Waiter was friendly, but service was slow. Would go back again. The only other note is that this place is a bit on the noisy side so at times it was very hard to hear our waiter and vice versa.
