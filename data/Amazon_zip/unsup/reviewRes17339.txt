The food is pretty darn good, but I'm giving Carnivale 2 stars and I'll tell you why. Every time I go there I have a strange experience. My first time there, they'd run out of guacamole. Unacceptable. My second time there it was my birthday and my mother made reservations for us, but we still waited 45 minutes for our table. Then the service was terrible. My third time there, the waiter was impatient, like he was just waiting for us to leave, and kept trying to take plates away that we weren't done with. I think he asked a total of 5 times if we were done. If you do go to Carnivale prepare yourself for an interesting experience, but for the price of the food I dare say save yourself the trip.
