Just have to add my two cents to the hundreds of others. This place is different - it still has "car hops." They serve a generous sized dog on a poppyseed bun, covered w/crinked fries, a great tasting pickle and a green tomato, all tucked neatly into a box. Gotta love the neon green relish! The vanilla shake gets 5 stars. Glad we thought of it while cruising up Milwaukee Ave.
