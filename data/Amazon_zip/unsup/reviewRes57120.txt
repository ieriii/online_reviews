We came here on a Friday night with a group of 12 to celebrate an engagement.Pros:- The food is astonishingly good. Do yourself a favor and try the Empanada and the Churrasco.- The ambiance is fun without being too loud for casual conversation, though it would have been nice to get a better table location.Cons:- Even with a reservation and with the restaurant not being full, we had to wait in the bar for 15 minutes to be seated. Not a fan of this.- I was surprised at how long it took for our first round of drinks to come out. Same for the appetizers that were ordered next.The drinks here get a lot of hype, but my sangria was pretty average. I would definitely come back to Carnivale again, but it is not high on my list.
