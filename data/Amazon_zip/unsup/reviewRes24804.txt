I called Geja's at 11:00am and asked for a reservation for 2 for that same evening which was a Friday (Friday before Valentine's). The gentlemen said he had a 9:30pm only available and it had just opened up. I gladly accepted. We arrived 9:05pm (seated 9:25pm) and were escorted to the bar to wait for our table. There we enjoyed a heart-shaped bowl of cheese spread & crackers. The atmosphere was so eclectic, hearts in the marble in the bar countertop, valentine's hearts, red lights, OMG!!! We received the best table in the house!!!! Our waitress, Cat, was from Buffalo NY and my boyfriend and her chatted about the movie Buffalo 66. I'm sure she had many, many tables to tend to but you know what, she really listened and was in the moment with us. I was super impressed with her patience and sense of ease. Actually, I encountered several of Geja's waitstaff who were above and beyond friendly!!!! Did I mention the romantic atmosphere??? I loved the cheese fondue with the apples & grapes. My boyfriend enjoyed dipping the bread in the cheese. Main course, so much food!!!! We couldn't even eat it all.... We had a blast losing our food off of our forks in the cooking bowl and laughing while digging to retrieve onions, beef tenderloins, shrimps, mushrooms, etc... Dessert, I really enjoyed the pineapple dipped in chocolate, marshmellow, & a sprinkling of graham cracker!!!! What a perfect time for celebrating Valentine's. I couldn't picture a better way!!!
