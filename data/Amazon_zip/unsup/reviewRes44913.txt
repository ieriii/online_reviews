My first trip to Chicago. I was in town for less than 24 hours in February, and was staying with a friend's sister. The plane touched down pretty late in the afternoon, so we only had time for one meal. "What do you want to eat?" she asks when she picks me up at the airport. "PIZZA." Everyone knows about Chicago's deep dish pizza. How could I leave the city without trying it? Coming from LA, Chicago is freaking FREEZING. The block and a half we walked from our parking space to the restaurant was like torture. So the blast of warm air and delicious pizza smells right as I walked through the door immediately made this place great. It was pretty packed, but the wait was still only about 20 minutes. We ordered our veggie pizza before we were seated to make the wait a little shorter. Service was quick, we got our pizza, and yeah. Hands down the best pizza I have ever had. Thick and cheesy and vegetable-y and saucy. Just yum all around. I also got to use a fork and knife to eat my pizza, which I always see people do but have never had the chance to do myself. (Because if it's not deep dish and cheesy and saucy, what's the point?) It's six months later and I still think about this place. If not for the fact that I wasn't going to be back in LA for another few days after leaving Chicago, I would have ordered some frozen ones to eat at home. I almost wish I were moving to Chicago and not Philly, because deep dish pizzas are infinitely more delicious than Philly cheesesteaks!
