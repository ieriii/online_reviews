Nose hair in egg roll, hair in rice, funky shrimp, two bad orders of grilled pork, watered down pho soup base, crappy service, waiter forgot half of order, waited over 45 minutes for order, waiters laughing at us...this is a summary of 4 visits with 4 friends. Should have stopped going after nose hair incident, but friends and Yelpers kept repping this place and they were always busy. I'd rather pull my own nose hairs out than eat here again. I'd rather watch my 78 year old neighbor clip his funky yellow toe nails than eat here. I'd rather eat the mystery meat in a can that fell off a truck that just left a horse farm than eat at Tank Noodle.
