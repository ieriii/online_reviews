XOCO does not mess around. Sure the line is long, but they are quick and the whole seating system works. Came here and ordered a lot of food because I was hungry and everything sounded great. Jugo del dia- Papaya lime juice. Amazing Aztec hot chocolate- thick, chocolaty with a little spice. Real different, but delicious. Chips and guac- pretty standard. Creamy guac. Delicious. "Top Chef" Torta- Braised beef tongue, chorizo, potato and avocado-sounded amazing and did not disappoint. Explosion of flavor. Pork Belly Torta- Was the special of the day and it was even better than the top chef torta. Delicious fatty pork belly with a salsa negra. Perfect sweet and salty combination. Churros and chocolate- Wow. Delicious churros and the chocolate just made it even better. Overall I was extremely impressed with XOCO. I wasn't sure if it would live up to the hype, but it did. Can't wait to come back and try everything!
