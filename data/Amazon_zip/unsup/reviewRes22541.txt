this place is great for so many reasons. awesome but cheap food. great patio (even in the winter, its heated and very comfortable). unique menu. BYOB! the only thing to be aware of, is that it can take a very long time to be served and pay. its very small with a tiny kitchen, so when its crowded it takes a while. it only accepts cash, and the register is busy when its time to pay. you can also wait a while for the restroom. as long as you go into your experience aware of these things, you'll have an amazing time for cheap.
