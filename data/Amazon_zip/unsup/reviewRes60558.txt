Went here once a few years ago after a day shopping on the Mag Mile. Remember having a really nice meal. Can't recall exactly what I had, but it was good. It had an elegant atmosphere, but was not too pretentious. I didn't feel uncomfortable in jeans there, but felt thoroughly sophistocated in this beautiful restaurant. It is pretty convenient to everything downtown too. Overall, a great experience.
