Enjoy the same great pizza and beer Piece servers for $25 on Sundays - 1 large pizza and a growler of beer to go. I haven't had experience with delivery, so I can't address the issues other reviewers mention, but if you're in the area on a Sunday and have the means to get it home, it should be mandatory.
