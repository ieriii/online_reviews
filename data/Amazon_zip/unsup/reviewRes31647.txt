ALWAYS amazing service - I love that the manager walks around and stops at every table to greet everyone. I've been to Sunda a couple times and have never had anything I didn't like. My favorite items are the loompya, steamed soup dumplings and the oxtail pot stickers. Make reservations! This place is always very busy!
