I love that they're open late and in my neighborhood. It's a cool place with the whole community, crowded feeling it maintains. The prices are okay and the food is fine. I go here more for the after drinking thing. But I once got the avocado salad and was anticipating something exciting. I got slices of avocados on a bed of unseasoned, watery lettuce. WHAT?? oh well. Then the incredibly un-interested waitress brought me thousand island dressing. I had to walk up to the bakery-thingy section to find her and ask if there was another dressing. (I asked very politely) NO. Yuck, I don't like thousand island. Especially on my mexican food. So I ate it with nothing but salt and pepper. So much for trying to be healthy. I recommend going simple here. Just get standard burritos/tacos etc. One more note: the man who seated us last time was so rude he was almost scary. I mean it seemed as though he wanted to wrestle the customers. Maybe he had issues....
