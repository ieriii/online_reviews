When you find yourself writing the 372nd review of a place, it sort of puts your personal significance into perspective. ahem. Anyway, I went to Piccolo Sogno ("Little Dream") for a company holiday party (by company, I mean all three Anything is Pawsible dog trainers, holla!). Dinner included a round of fried calamari (better w/o the marinara, imo), a special ravioli (w/ lobster/shrimp/anything-w/-a-shell), a gnocchi invernali, a rare ahi tuna, a puff pastry/custard dessert and a blueberry tart (godalmighty,yes!), and two glasses of jammy/spicy red wine. I'm re-gaining weight just thinking about it. I had the gnocchi inervali and I LOVED it, except for the gnocchi. But I think I just don't like gnocchi, so that's my own fault! (Doughy potato-pasta balls? Really, Italy?) I've already decided to return in my fat pants and ask for the invernali sauce all over some angle hair pasta. The blueberry tart reconfirmed my belief in a higher being: imagine everything good about dessert - then douse it with blueberries. And then warm it up. It was on the a specials menu, so let's all start a call-in campaign to get it on the menu through blueberry season. 312-421-0077, go! Our waiter and his slew of helpers were nice. The only really bittersweet moment was when we finally allowed them to take away our calamari - after being asked four times to remove it, we started to feel as if it's customary that some calamari should go back to the kitchen and be reunited with the chef. Don't pay for parking, just drive around back and park in the loading zone spot. (It's only zoned from 9a-5p, yer welcome.)
