This is my favorite Chicago Pizza place to get Pizza by the slice for their Pan and Stuffed. Their crust for each has a nice buttery softness that's a little easier to bite into than other pan or stuff places, like Giordano's (which I also love). Crust has just the right amount of flavor, not overdone. Cheese and ingredients are fresh and reasonably priced.  Their thin crust is generous on the cheese and, like their Pan/stuff crust, has plenty of flavor. Their thin Meaty Delight is my favorite chicago-styled thin crust pizza in the city. I am not a meat lovers fan either, but this is the exception to that. The inside is casual, BYOB, and plenty of seating. Though it's not a place that's really known as a dine-in restaurant, mainly because their service and quality is great on their delivery and carry-out. That said, a good amount of people bring in beer on weekends for dine-in. Definitely not your typically deserted take-out place. They also have great weekly deals on non-pizza menu items.
