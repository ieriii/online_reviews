I've been wanting to try a colombian steakhouse for quite a while now and when a groupon appeared to this place I decided it was that time. Tip: If you have a groupon you HAVE to make a reservation. We didn't order any appetizers since I saw how generous the portions were, but I did order the Caipirinha. It was very strong, if I had another one I probably would have gotten a buzz. For dinner we had the Picada Colombiana for 2. The chicken was my favorite part. It was very flavorful and not dry at all. The steak had a good flavor, but it was kind of chewy. The chorizo was good, i mean its sausage come on. The ribs were nasty. Very dry and flavorless. Now on to the carbs. The potato was nothing special, the yuca was awesome though, and the tostones were good as well. Our waiter was really good as well so no complaints there. The food came out in about 10 minutes or so. I would come back to las tablas, but I wouldn't get the combination plate again.
