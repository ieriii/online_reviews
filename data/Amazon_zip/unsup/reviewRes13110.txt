Came here while on vacation with my sis for her birthday, and had a really great time over great food. I've never been to a churrascaria, so this was a pleasantly surprising experience. First off, I was really impressed with the variety and quality of the salad/side bar which included good seared ahi. Second, the drinks were delicious: we had a caipirinha, traditional mojito, and Brazilian mojito made with cachaca--all really strong but well balanced. Third, the service was very attentive though it got a little hectic with all the guys with meat on skewers running up to us. Finally: tasty grilled meat of all kinds. My favorite was the lamb chops. The lamb chop guy made several trips back to the kitchen to get me ones that were cooked just the way I like it.  One minor complaint: the fried bananas (sadly, not plantains) they bring to your table when you start asking for meat are sprinkled with cinnamon sugar, totally unnecessary. And the meat is over-salted, though this is a fairly standard restaurant trick. Pricey as heck (though a good value) but a good time if you're in the mood for an "experience".
