Fantastic food. I ordered the chicken w/ candied pear & goat cheese & my boyfriend ordered the gage supreme burger (I might be a little bit off on the name). We got the Brie cheese fondue & both thought it was pretty good. They have a wide variety of good beers & an incredibly knowledgable & pleasant wait staff. The food was great, the bill was pretty high for 2 ppl but i guess that is to be expected from any good restaurants right downtown on Michigan ave.. We probably will only go there for special occasions in the future bcs it is a little over priced
