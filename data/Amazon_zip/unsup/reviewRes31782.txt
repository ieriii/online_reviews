As a vegetarian, its so refreshing to come into a restaurant and you can order anything on the menu. I felt like a kid in a candy shop, feeling so excited with all of my choices. I ordered a bacon cheeseburger and devoured it less than 3 minutes- it was that good. But what really got me reeling was the sweet potato fries. Whoever makes sweet potato fries ANYWHERE needs to figure out how the Chicago Diner does it. Wow! Why did I wait so long to stop by? Not sure, but it won't take me long to return!
