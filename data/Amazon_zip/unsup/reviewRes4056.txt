Here's the skinny on a highly anticipated restaurant: The food was good, but not great. Four out of nine dishes were more sweet than savory, which I found rather odd. The oyster amuse bouche shooter had a sweet froth, a crab dish too, and a tiny piece of halibut was served with a giant "paint" of burnt marshmallow. There was just not enough fish for the amount of marshmallow which made this dish way off balance, not to mention the whole sweet thing again and again. What gives? On the other hand, some components were way too salty to eat (this was our table of five's consensus not just mine). ***The best dish of the night was a quail egg raviolo ***We had late reservations so perhaps its best to book early to avoid any kitchen mishaps... ***You'll be disappointed if you go for the three course so do the nine, however, my meal was not worth the price but fingers crossed yours is! ***The "experience" at Schwa was what its all about, in my opinion. The loud music, interactive/charming/funny chefs, and positive energy made up for the food...a little. If you haven't gone, you should go and give it a shot...maybe my night was an off night, I don't know. Judging from said night I wouldn't return for a repeat visit, but am glad I went. It just wasn't the "best meal of my life" or even the best I've had in Chicago...and I was expecting that.
