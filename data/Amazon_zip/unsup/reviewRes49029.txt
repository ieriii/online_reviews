Had dinner here on Saturday June 27th. Read many posts about this place, was very excited to go. They hit a home run, not a grand slam. We ordered many dishes. One, being the pork belly. Was cooked a little too long, and thus made it very chewy. Pork belly for one should always melt in your mouth, almost like butter... The ribs were very good, and HUGE. I didn't care for the sardines, but it was also my first time eating them. My wife liked them, as she ate all 4. The beer list, is very good also...
