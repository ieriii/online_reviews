This is not for the amateur. They put this bowl of white-hot charcoal in the middle of the table, give you mounds of raw meat (we had Kalbi--excellent, and pork belly--not bad), impressive array of sidedishes, and you go to work. the heat and the grease sometimes caused flames to shoot up and threatened to engulf my outstretched chopstick-wielding hands. But hey, no pain, no gain. We just kept throwing meat onto the grill and food into our mouths until our bellies were at the very verge of explosion. It was good. very good. it's unfortunate that i've lived in LA, and i know there is even better stuff out there. but this was definitely a solid 4- star.
