go to boka, it's in the same price range and much better. i had the exact same expectations for boka as i did graham elliot. (celebrity chef, new american dishes, expensive but worth it date night, etc.) boka beat my expectations, and GE fell way way short. extremely disappointed with graham elliot... the service was poor for the perceived quality of this restaurant. if we were at chili's i would be fine with the service, but when spending $300 on a meal + wine for 2, i expect much better service.  the popcorn which everyone raves about was served cold -- we asked if it was supposed to be served like that and waitress said no and that she would go get some fresh popcorn. we never were given the fresh popcorn. the food was good, but nothing was GREAT. we had the kobe beef and bbq chicken for apps. both were very good, but nothing to brag about. i had the skirt steak, my fiance ordered the tuna. again, both fine dishes. then, instead of ordering dessert, i asked the waitress what her favorite dish of the 8 appetizers was (4 cold/4 hot) and she recommended the tuna sashimi. being that this was her favorite out of all 8, i thought for sure i would be impressed. but once again, it was a fine dish but nothing special. bottom line, from a "top chef masters" and for $300, i expect much better service and at least 1 or 2 dishes that truly impress me.
