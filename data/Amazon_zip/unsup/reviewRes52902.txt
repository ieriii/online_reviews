Having JUST done about a 4 mile walk, I was sweaty, hungry, hot and in desperate need of a yummy lunch. Enter 90 Miles Cuban Cafe. While most sandwiches on the menu are sinful, the pollo (chicken), grilled with lettuce, tomato and yummy grilled onions served on a nice, toasty roll was tasty, fresh AND felt mildly healthy. Add a side of black beans (hot and soupy - just the way I like em) and a guava and cheese empanada (holy shit... sweet, creamy and the best surprise of the meal) and a can (or two) of diet Coke and you have a seriously happy camper. This location has way more seating than the Roscoe Village location and boasts a large, shady patio. Perfect for lounging with your girlfriends for a leisurely catch-up session. What kept me from coming here for so long? I'll be back soon. I can't WAIT to try some of the other (read: pork product) sandwiches.
