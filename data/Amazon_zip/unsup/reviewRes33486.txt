I had dinner recently at Mia's while visiting Chicago. The sole reason for me wanting to visit the Clark street restaurant was because the spot was dubbed Jennifer Aniston's favorite restaurant...and obviously I'm starstruck.  The ambiance of Mia's is very relaxed and the tables are all fairly close to one another. The seating resembles wooden church pews and you feel as though you are in a dining room at someone's home, which makes it seem cozier.  The staff was very friendly, however when we were choosing a bottle of wine the server didn't provide us with feedback or specifics regarding the reds we were interested in. With "grape expectations" we opted on a Malbec and were thoroughly delighted with our choice.  When it came time to order food, we went with the scallops and shrimp dish as well as a goat cheese pasta entree. Both of the meals were fantastic and the flavor was mouthgasmic for lack of a better word (go ahead I dare you to find a better one). At the end of our meal we ordered the pistachio ice cream puffs with chocolate drizzle...they were everything and more than expected. The entire experience at Mia's was pleasant and worthwhile. I will be back!
