My wife and I arranged a graduation party for our son at Calo Ristorante. We couldn't have asked for a better venue, more attentive service, such wonderful food or more generous beverages than what Saqib and his staff provided for us. We recommend them without hesitation. This establishment will be a must stop whenever we're in town.
