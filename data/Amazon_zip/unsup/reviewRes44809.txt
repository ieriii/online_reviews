Don't judge me for the fact that my reviews of late have been about pizza joints. I eat other things, I swear. So my verdict for Giordano's is---not as good as Lou Malnati's! (But better than Gino's East). I appreciated the pre-order option here (we ordered while waiting, so by the time we were seated we only waited 10 mins before our pizza arrived). But the pizza itself was overwhelming, our mushrooms and olives were smothered by the cheese, and in general it felt like way too much. I realize that deep dish isn't meant to be a "light meal," but I feel like Lou Malnati's finds the perfect ratio of ingredients to cheese to crust for a deep dish pizza.
