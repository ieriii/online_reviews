went here for the first time for a friends birthday party...and i have a few thoughts...(i guess i always do). pros: -byob...and no corking fee, but no liquor, beware -really really fresh fish...the tuna was melt in my mouth...best sushi ive had in chicago so far... -really nice staff, super helpful..my bf isnt much of a sushi person (hes trying but it may be an acquired taste for him) and our server was really great about helping him pick a roll he'd like -there was some roll w/eel in it...and it was delicious. im not normally an eel person (too sweetish) but this roll was really great! cons: -pretty pricy...most of the rolls were pretty large, but they charge you a pretty penny...coast is a special occasion type of place for me! -not enough spicy sauce on the spicy tuna...sadness. -1 stall for the ladies restroom. i went twice (it was a long dinner ok?!) and there was a line of at least 5 ladies ahead of me...
