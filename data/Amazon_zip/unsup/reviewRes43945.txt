Phenomenal! We tried out this restaurant after our hotel concierge recommended it. I ordered the filet, while my fiance got the prime rib. We split a caesar salad and a baked potato. Our steaks were cooked perfectly, and the sides were amazing too. We will definitely be back to this restaurant. The food and service was spectacular!! Five stars from me!
