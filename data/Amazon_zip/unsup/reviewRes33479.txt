Delicious and Cheap Middle Eastern Food! What's not to love? I have been meaning to try this place for awhile and I am happy I did. If you are in the mood for some homemade chicken potato soup this is the place to try out. Both the lamb and chicken shawerma were amazing and  I liked that the amount of spice added could be chosen by the customer. The packaged hummas, pitas, cookies, etc. also looked good. Stop at the ATM before coming here though, because they only accept cash...small price to pay though for the delicious food!
