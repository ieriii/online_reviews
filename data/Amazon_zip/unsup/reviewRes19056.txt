Most white people I've seen making food in a Mexican restaurant. On a Sat night there was a HUGE line for the dining room. I waited about 30 min for take out. The place is good and I would recommend it, BUT if your from SoCal you can get the same or better food for half the price in many many places. To me this place is more of a lunch spot (sandwich,soups) then dinner (entrees). I didn't get a chance to try their soups but they looked really good. *Tinga Chicken Torta- average chicken flavor, nice crusty bread *Churro and Chocolate - da bomb, excellent chocolate dip *Side Salad - crazy good limey dressing
