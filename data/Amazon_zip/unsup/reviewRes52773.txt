My friends have been telling me about this place for a while - so happy I finally made it here! Went early on Saturday with 2 friends. We had 6:30 reservations, and arrived 1/2 hour early. Was able to wait upstairs, open our wine, and write on the walls! Our waiter was so friendly and gave great recommendations.  We had 2 appetizers, and both were plentiful and flavorful. I had the special paella of the night. I would go back just to eat this again! So much food and all of it wonderfully prepared. BYOB also!  Can't wait to go back.
