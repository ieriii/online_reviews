I have been a customer of Nuevo Leon for 29 out of 32 years I have been on this planet. My family sometimes gets take-out and drives it home 28 miles west of Pilsen. Believe me the food stays warm the entire trip! First off order the Quesadilla Raul. It is filled with chihuahua cheese and smothered in red sauce and onions. Goes great with the free tortilla chips as you scoop them up. Sometime I am in the Nachos Dias kind of mood loaded with ranchero sauce, sour cream and gucamole. That a must! Okay now for the main course bistec a la mexicana regular. I absolutely go on record saying the pieces of skirt steak simmered to perfection in their house salsa/sauce is the best! Its got a kick so becareful if you are not a spicy maniac like I. In the past this place has been under the heat lamp for bad reviews, but I only order and stick to my comfort zone. There are plates on the menu I will NOT try. Nuevo Leon is part of my child hood growing up. Upon each visit it reminds me of my family and the family that has passed and gone. Fast service and friendly staff is what makes my experience a great one.
