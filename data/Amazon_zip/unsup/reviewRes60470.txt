Went here last night for the second time, first time I had the soup of the day (potato leek). It was memorable enough for me to come back a year later. This time, for starters we had the cheddar artichoke dip, very good dip; not so good toasted bread, fell apart while trying to pile on the dip. The I had the super good chicken pot pie, pastry was baked around the bowl of insides, so it was piping hot. The pastry was a little bit doughy though. No hot sauce available only Tobasco pepper sauce. We also tried the blackened chicken club sandwich with avocado; very good...not the best fresh cut fries, a substitute is recommended.The decor and aesthetics of this place is awesome, fire places, leather seating, tin ceilings. Great bottled beer selection, good service ( a little too quick to box our food from the bus boy) The chicken pot pie is great, be careful it comes HOT. The place is big so no worries about finding a table for two.
