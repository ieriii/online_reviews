My girlfriend came in from Australia a few months ago. I was so nervous because it was the first time we were meeting face to face after dating online for a year. For our anniversary dinner I decided to take her out for a romantic fondue dinner. After much deliberation I decided to venture out to Geja's. We arrived about 15 minutes earlier than our reservation and were seated right away. The environment was inviting even if it was a bit dark. We sat down across the table from eachother. My girlfriend ever the nut asked the waitress for permission to sit next to me at the table. She was elated when permission was granted. I had to laugh at her for asking permission. The bus boys were attentive and pleasant from the start. We received our glasses of water and they even took a photo of us together for my girlfriend.  The appetizer was delicious with the cheese fondue. We ordered the International and Breast of Chicken with Sea Scallops for our entree. It was a lot of fun and very interactive cooking the food in the oil and trying all of the different dips that you get along with the dinner. And dessert....well let's just say it definately served its purpose.  The check came and it was about what I expected. It is expensive but well worth the price if you are looking to impress. Make a reservation before you go and make it early in the evening so you aren't stuck waiting.
