I was introduced to this place recently and have been back twice in the last month. Sooooo good, and the Bad Boy Buddha bowl (may favorite) includes a wonderful mix of vegetables. You cannot go wrong with the organic brown rice either (minimal extra charge). This food fills you up!  Chicken is good too, if you don't mind getting your fingers a little messy. The staff here are super-friendly and pleasantly chat with you.  They deliver, but the atmosphere and large bench-style tables make it worthwhile to dine in.
