I love this place. They have a great beer selection and the beer they brew is pretty solid. On top of all that they have a really great menu featuring local produce, meat and dairy. Always check out their daily specials. You won't regret it. To items I find myself always getting are the beer cheese soup and the cauliflower bruschetta. Meat eaters and veggie can get along at Revolution. The smoke tofu sandwich and the pizzas are awesome. Do it.
