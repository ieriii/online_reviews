Like Julia D., I have chosen THE ART OF PIZZA as my inaugural review. Haling from the east coast, I was very skeptical of deep dish pizza. I like my pies New Haven style: thin, crispy, blackened crusts and fresh, minimal ingredients. After an unfortunate experience at GINO'S EAST, where my single serve spinach deep dish tasted like a breadbowl filled with ragu, I swore off deep dish pizza for a time. Then I moved to Roscoe Village and, after much convincing from my roommate, I agreed to try a slice of THE ART OF PIZZA. Sadly, when I paid my first visit, they had no vegetarian slices left on the hotplates. I was disappointed, and I swore off deep dish pizza for a second time. When I finally returned to THE ART OF PIZZA, the pieces fell into place. I bought one slice of green pepper, mushroom and onion stuffed pizza for a couple bucks, and my life changed. The clouds lifted and the birds sang. I never imagined deep dish pizza could taste like this. In the many times that I have been back there, I have never had a problem with there being no vegetarian options. I have since tried deep dish pizza at a number of deep dish pizzeria's claiming to be THE BEST DEEP DISH PIZZA IN CHICAGO. LOU MALNATI'S, GIORDANO'S, GINO'S, EDWARDO'S, PEQUOD'S, CHICAGO'S. None of these places are nearly as good as THE ART OF PIZZA. One caveat: yes, delivery and takeout orders do tend to take a very, very long time. Be prepared to wait, but know that the wait is worth it.
