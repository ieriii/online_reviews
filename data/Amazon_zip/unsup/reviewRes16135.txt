This is a great place to take a date, but shoot for a weeknight date when it's not so packed. And don't be afraid to inquire about the drinks. The servers know so much about them. It's a very classy place, but no club. Think prohibition-era drinks meets funky, yet elegant decor in a relaxing setting. This is where my guy took me on our second date. There is no sign, so he just walked into a random door with a yellow light above it. There are super-high ceiling and long curtains in the dimly lit entrance. I thought for sure it was some underground smut club. Much to my surprise it was amazing. I haven't stopped talking about it. A must-visit.
