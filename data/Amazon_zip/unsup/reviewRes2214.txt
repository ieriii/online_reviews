It was everything I expected...simply stunning. We waited in line for a little over 30 minutes to finally order our rattlesnake and duck dogs with duck fat fries. I would suggest going close to when they open or close to not wait as long. Also try to make it on a Friday or Saturday because those are the only days they serve the duck fat fries. You're missing out if you have the chance to eat them and you don't...it's as simple as that.
