If you can get a room here for a deal, make it happen. Its value is in it's location near the loop and Magnificent Mile. With over 2k rooms there is a large mall or airport feel to the place. It's convenient and clean. Especially for business and tourist attractions. I would suggest traveling out of the loop if your looking for a nice evening of Chicago food and bars. Everything closes early near the hotel and you pay a premium in this business/tourist part of town. There's no free wireless, but they do have neat little computers set up to print your boarding pass before heading out.
