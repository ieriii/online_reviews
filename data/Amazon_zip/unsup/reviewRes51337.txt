My siblings and I were not sure where to go for dinner until my brother-in-law suggested Mexican. We decided to walk into the heart of Lincoln Square to get dinner.  My standards are pretty high for Mexican being that I spend a lot of time in Mexicantown in Detroit. The four of us were seated quickly we then got some good chips and salsa which we ate quickly and got an immediate refill. We ordered and got our food quickly. It was huge and big. I did not realize that the meals would be so big. It was also reasonable for Chicago standards...but not in comparison to the hole-in-the wall Mexican you can find in Pilsen or LIttle Village.  We left with three take-out boxes for another meals worth of Mexican.  Overall it was a good experience and I would go back again.
