I've had this delivered to a friend's place, and man was it good! He ordered sushi (which, from the piece I tried, was delicious) and I got gyoza and pad khee mow (or however they spell it here). I must say, I was both impressed with the food and the delivery time. I just wish that they would deliver to Evanston! All in all, probably one of the best places you can get delivery from in the area, especially if you want to satisfy a few different Asian cravings at once.
