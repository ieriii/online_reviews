90 Miles is one of the best Cuban restaurants that I have been to. It does not disappoint. To start off with you have to try the Empanadas. As my entree I usually share the Churrasco and the Ropa Vieja. Aside from having great food it also has a very lively atmosphere. They have a guy playing the guitar. You really feel like you are in Cuba while you are there.  This restaurant is great for having drinks and food with friends, definitley not if you are in a hurry. I am usually there a minimum of two hours. Not sure why it takes so long, but hey I just enjoy my surroundings while I wait. All in all if you like Cuban food, this is a must try!
