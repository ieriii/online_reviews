The food here is excellent, no doubt. But after a 2.5 hour wait on a Saturday night (we arrived at 5:45pm!!!), anything would have tasted good. That said, amazing value with a menu top to bottom with very well priced choices, as well as an seemingly endless list of (again, well priced) wines. Would we come again? For the food, yes -- absolutely. If we had to wait 2.5 hours before our table for four is available .... I'd have to say no :(
