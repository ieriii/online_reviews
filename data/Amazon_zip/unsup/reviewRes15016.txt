Came here on a saturday night. It's definitely one of those place where you want to go hang out, drink and chill with ONLY your friends. Since everyone gets their own table, so it's quite hard for you to talk to other people, which is a good and bad thing (sorry girls, you can't sweet talk dudes into buying you drinks here) I had the followings: Juliet & Romeo Fries Gnocci and ton of sips of alot of other drinks The drinks are good and the bar food goes well them. Definitely a great place to go.
