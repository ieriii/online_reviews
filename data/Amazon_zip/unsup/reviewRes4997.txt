A small, intimate restaurant with amazing food and a stellar wine list that's also a good value ... all on Michigan avenue? Is it true? Absolutely. As a local Chicagoan, I tend to avoid many of the restaurants along Michigan avenue since they are generally geared toward tourists and/or are overpriced compared to all of the lovely neighborhood gems. However, I've been proven wrong. The restaurant itself is much smaller than I expected with tables lining along the windows and the one wall, and diners also lined up at the bar to taste the tapas. The decor is simple, but well done to feel like a Mediterranean tapas bar. The wine menu is extensive with pages of Greek, Spanish, French and Italian wines - many of which are under $40 a bottle. The cheeses are exquisite and sourced from Pastoral which I love. We opted to try new ones, and really enjoyed the recommendations from our waiter. The pork shoulder was tender and just fell apart, while the black cod offered a lighter option accented with grapefruit. The Sicilian Iris for dessert, a splurge in the calorie department, was a wonderful doughnut meets canoli creation. Downside is that it can become very congested around 7-8pm as people wait for a table since there is no good spot to stand in the restaurant without being in someone's way. Just a result of the no reservations policy.
