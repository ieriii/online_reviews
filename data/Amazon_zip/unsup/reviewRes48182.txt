For dinner, this is the best restaurant in Chicago. This is a place for people who love meat. I believe that their specialty lies in making strange meats taste amazing (for example, their scrapple is mouthwatering, hearts are delectable, and the sweetbreads are to die for). I loved the oyster platter (3 from the east coast, 3 from the west coast). Since you could easily spend $100 per person and go wild, I will just give two tips for how to eat a great meal for a bargain price here: 1. Go for brunch. You can eat brunch for $10-20, and you won't be sorry. Order the bacon plate ($7) for the table. It's very thick-cut and fatty in a way that melts in your mouth, and it's doused in maple syrup. I've had the chicken fried steak (4 stars), the hanger steak with grilled peaches (5 stars) and the red wine poached eggs with prosciutto (4 stars). 2. At dinner, order the whole chicken. It comes with fries and could easily feed a small table. No one wants to order chicken at the Publican because there are so many more intriguing options, but if you do, it will be one of the best chickens you've ever tasted. Finally, the interior is beautiful. The restaurant is in the old meatpacking district and the decorations are pig-themed. At the bathroom (which has fantastic soaps), you wash your hands in a communal trough. If you sit on the main wall you will sit in a booth with swinging doors, like a pig stall. The wooden fixtures, big ball lights, and old-timey pig pictures will surely win over even the coldest, most meat-loathing of hearts.
