Went to Shaws for a post-movie meal. I have been here a couple of times and still cant complain. . . much.       We started off our meal with a couple of rolls, the lobster, avocado & cucumber and the spicy crab, salmon and lemon (server suggestion) and the lobster bisque. The lobster roll was good. Ive had it before. The crab one. . . oh my god! It was so good. The very thin slices of lemon on top are a perfect little citrusy punch. I loved it.       Our server was a little M.I.A. for a bit, but when he did finally return, we ordered. My guy got the loster roll sandwich. Which is always great. I got the mahi tacos. They were sad. Oh so very sad. The presentation was not all that impressive and the portion was minimal. Three tacos with one, tiny fried piece of fish in the middle. It was tough and didnt really have much flavor. Like I said, oh so very sad.       Of course, I will be back, but this experience has taught me to stick to my signature dishes at this place.
