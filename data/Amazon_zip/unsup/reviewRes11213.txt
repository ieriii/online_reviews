Piece is an oasis in the hipster jungle. It's a down-to-earth place that seems to cater to all types. I might even go as far as to say kid-friendly. They crank out really good pizza and brew some pretty good beer to wash them down. This is another place that you have to eat at to fully enjoy the pizza. It doesn't hold up as well for delivery. And while I wouldn't say its a sports bar, they definitely have enough tvs tuned to the games of the day. And if you're feeling spunky, check out their live band karaoke.
