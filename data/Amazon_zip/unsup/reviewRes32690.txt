I enjoyed the black beans and the greens. The wings were not at all what I expected, but the soy strawberry milkshake made up for that. What a treat!! The customer service staff was great, but a little slow on the Saturday evening that I was there due to the crowd. I highly recommend this place to anyone, vegan or not, it is worth a try.
