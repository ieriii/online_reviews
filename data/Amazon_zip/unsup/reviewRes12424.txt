Had to give Cafe 28 a try after reading all the rave reviews on Yelp - after dinner, I have to admit my mixed feelings about the place... Arrived at the restaurant and was surprised by how big this place was!! The entrance looked like a tiny bar / 5-table place, yet when the host waved us out back, I was pleasantly surprised by the large dining room (x2!) It was a nice, warm evening, so I figured I'd give the outdoor patio a try. Con #1: They only had dim lights / candles on selected tables, and for some reason, despite our early arrival hence empty seats, we were led to a 2-seat table with no candles, and not under any light. This spelled disaster for the remaining evening.. as our server didn't even offer to light a candle, and we couldn't see what our platters looked like at all! We decided to give the Calamar a la Parilla a go, nothing spells exotic Cuban cuisine like fresh seafood! The calamari were tasty, charcoal-grilled so you can taste hints of smokiness. The "red pepper sauce, sauted vegetables & queso de cabra (goat cheese)" was fantastic, and truly complemented the dish. With such a great appetizer, I was in a happier mood. I was underwhelmed by the service though... there were less than 10 tables in the restaurant (6pm on Tues), yet our server was super slow and paid far more attention to the table next to us (who ordered a HUGE pork chop), not to mention our candle still hasn't arrived. Con #2: The outdoor patio is situated behind the Brown line track, so you'd hear occasional train pasting, creating a REALLY loud noise... not the most romantic addition to the background music... After our long wait, we finally ordered the entree: La Ropa Vieja with a side of fried yucca. The meat was flavorful, but nothing distinctly unique and I didn't find the herbs "Cuban" enough.... Overall an O-K experience, maybe seating indoor + pairing with mojito will make this a better trip.
