Decided to go hear on a whim, as I had read many positive reviews about it (both on yelp and in Time Out). Excellent patio - roomy, very green, really nice ambience. I wouldn't want to sit inside though - way too dark, with linoleum floors (why?). My companion said it reminded him of a haunted house with chandeliers.  Our appetizer (caprese salad) was quite good. However, both of our pasta dishes were just average. My gnocchi was relatively bland, while my companion's penne was quite chewy.  Since this place opened a week ago, though, I understand they're still working out the kinks. I have high hopes for it and hope to return again before the summer ends.
