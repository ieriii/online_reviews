This place is definitely 5 star-worthy! A group of us went for a work outing and got the $55 per person tasting menu. It was AMAZING! Everything we had was wonderful. First off, the red sangria was really good and I don't even like sangria! As for the food, I am a firm believer in just letting this chef select my meal. We got about 8 appetisers to share and 4 entrees. Not one disappointed. The cured meat melted in your mouth, the spanish omelet, octopus, meatballs...I don't even remember what else but everything was mouthwatering. And the entrees were killer...tender beef and lamb, spicy jumbo shrimp, and a tasty mushroom and rice dish! The service was great. The food just kept coming and each server explained in detail what the dishes were. The decor is very pretty. This is a great place to impress out-of-towners. I can't wait to go back and get the tasting menu again!
