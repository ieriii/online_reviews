* I would give this place 2.5 stars* I finally got to try Chicago Diner last weekend. Very cute location right off Halsted, but it's a tight space. You will probably need to wait. The menu is not that impressive. I felt it was very repetitive. There weren't a whole lot of things I wanted to try. I had the huevos mexicana and it was good, but surprising greasy. I have to remind myself that just because it's vegan or organic doesn't mean it's healthy. I'm sure they cook with healthy oils, but it's still oil. I'm not opposed to going back and the place is certainly crowded enough most of the time so they're doing something right, but.... it's not high on my list to do again.
