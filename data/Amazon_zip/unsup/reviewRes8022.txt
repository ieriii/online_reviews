Best brazilian steakhouse in the city. I have been to Brazzaz, Texas De Brazil and Fogo. Texas has the best salad bar, Brazzaz is the only one with pineapple(amazing), but the star of a Churrascaria is the meat and Fogo de Chao wins that hands down. Every cut of meat is amazing, and better than everywhere else. There isn't one cut that I can say is better at another place than at Fogo. There is no sauce needed, everything is seasoned perfectly and juicy. This is also the only place that did Parmesan pork right! And the lamb chops are ridiculous. The salad bar is the worst out of all the churrascarias, but that's okay. It's still filled with high quality ingredients. And Fogo also has the best table sides; fried bananas, mashed potatoes and bread. I never complained about the price. It's well worth it but at least once a year...because you'll probably not want to see another piece of red meat after a trip to this place!
