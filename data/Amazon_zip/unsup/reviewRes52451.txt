So you pay about $50 per person and you get to eat all of the meat you can - in theory. Except here I could only find very few meaty things that I actually wanted to eat more of - the quality of the meats wasn't very good and nothing had a lot of flavor, other than one delicious porky thing. And they were out of the skewered shrimp very early into the evening - How did that happen? The staff were all very nice, but we went very long periods of time without being offered anything at all and having to really look around and try to find somebody with something - and when we found them they would always seem to have the same something, like they had lots of certain cuts they were definitely trying to push over the others. My favorite things here weren't meat at all, but the roasted pineapple on the skewer and the risotto at the "salad" bar. The risotto was mushroom and super creamy and perfect, but as good as it was, it was still disappointing that the meat wasn't the shining star. And as much as I loved - loved - the pineapple, I was disappointed when I had to kind of haggle to be able to finish off my meal with it, because I was getting a hard sell on the desserts that you have to pay extra for instead. It was a decent enough meal, but it is overpriced for what you get. If you've ever experienced the meat onslaught and incredible service at Fogo de Chao, though, this will come up far short in terms of the food and the experience. There is really no reason to eat here for the same cost as Fogo, but if you're going to try it out do lunch instead of dinner for about half of the cost. I would maybe go back if I had one of those coupons people were talking about, but we were told they were going to mail us one and I don't think we ever got it - just as well.
