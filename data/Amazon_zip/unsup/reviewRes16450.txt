I came back here for the 3rd or 4th time this past year and i can't explain how much i love this place. It's just one of those spots that grow on you slowly, ( like a mold? ). I guess as i grow out of my early 20's and into my mid 20's i crave more of a laid back, relaxed setting. coming in here last night i ran into some friends who were going out to debonair and empire , amongst other louder bars in the area - maybe it's just me, but i'm really over the bar scene where it's too loud to talk to your neighbor, your shoes get stepped on by drunk frat types, there are ogle eyed out of towners trying to get a city experience....and  watered down cocktails still run 10-12 bucks. for 12 bucks a drink, you can probably get some of the best made, fairly strong, and damn tasty liquour in the city at violet hour. the only downside to last night was that they aren't really enforcing their cell phone rules anymore - the people sitting next to me were literally videotaping each other with their blackberry cameras - with those obnoxious bright camera flash light thingies. - this is why i must subtract a star from an otherwise perfect bar.
