I love their wine flights. The food wasn't that memorable, but I only go for the wine anyway. Coming from the Bay Area, I cringe when I see the mark-up in their wine store, but what can ya do, you're in the mid-west. I like the fact that they are connected with the House of Blues Hotel - what a shwanky bathroom!
