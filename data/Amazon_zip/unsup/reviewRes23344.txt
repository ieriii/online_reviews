I have never had Costa Rican food before, so thought to try this.  The food seemed quite similar to dishes from around the area.  The restaurant is nice, the service is fast, and be sure to have cash as they do not accept credit cards. Food is good too. It is not bad, but not out of this world great either. It is filling and you will not need to eat for another day. I ate around 12 today and I still do not feel hungry. The food is tasty, not too greasy and is presented nicely. I would try try it out once to get the experience. Also, the shakes and drinks provided are great!
