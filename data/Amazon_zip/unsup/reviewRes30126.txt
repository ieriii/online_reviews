I love 3rd Coast. It's anything you want it to be. A coffee house with unlimited refills, a wine bar, late night munchie place, brunch, lunch, dinner, anything! It's in the heart of the Gold Coast, and one of the few restaurants in the immediate area. The staff is always friendly and I was pleasantly surprised at their wine knowledge. Perfect for groups, brunch with the parents, or a nice date night. The menu is large and orders come out quick. I always forget about this place, but always happy when we end up going.
