Okay. I am SUPER picky about hotels and I usually pick the hotel but this time my b/f chose the hotel. The Whitehall Hotel is an older hotel. It has old charm and it is in a awesome location. (walking distance to pretty much everything) But, again, it was an older hotel. The elevators were small and every time I walked into my room it smelled like an old folks home. Also, the walls are thin. It never failed, each night at 2am the guy above me came in, slammed his door and took a shower. I could hear it all. BUT, on a positive note, the staff was friendly and helpful, the hotel was in a good location and the bed was comfortable.
