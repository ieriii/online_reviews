Oh boo hoo, cry me a fucking river to all these people giving Brazzaz a 2 star rating. If you can't give Brazzaz at least a 4 star rating, it's not the restaurant's fault.... I"m pretty sure it's your own fucking fault you're such a picky eater and a self proclaimed "foody". Why the fuck would you come here if you don't want to eat meat Jesse B. from 12/11/08? Maybe you should go outside and eat some polluted grass in a Chicago park? Maybe you'll give it a 3.5 then...? Let me tell you why Brazzaz is so amazing...: -All the delicious food you can eat, that is of high quality, and isn't going to cost you a shit load of money. -Tons of amazing meants (fillet Mignon too) among others.. -Really friendly service, and constant attention If you're reading this review, I really want you to go here. It is one of my top 5 restaurants in Chicago, and you will not be sorry after you eat here. If you're a real man (unlike Jesse B. from 12/11/08), you will thoroughly enjoy this place enough to actually want to go here and spend the money on a date (aka eating frenzy)...
