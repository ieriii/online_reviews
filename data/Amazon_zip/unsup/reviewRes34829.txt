Ok, so we absolutely GORGED ourselves on some seriously delicious half-priced sushi last night. The three of us agreed that it was some of the best sushi we have had in a long time and we each have sushi several times a month. A couple things: The seating in the side area is poorly set up and it made it difficult for our server to get to us, therefore we didn't get a lot of service. When you first walk in, its so dark you can hardly see! Yikes. The table was a little grimy and the soy sauce bottle was a little icky too. Once I got over those things, I ate as though I hadn't eaten in days. The Red Dragon - uh-maz-ing. I also had the White Tiger. Yum. My friend had the Godzilla. Deeeelicious (a little too much cream cheese for me, but still very tasty) and this one that was all veggies with a ginger dipping sauce that was really good too. Overall it was super fresh, tasty and we absolutely stuffed ourselves for $24 each INCLUDING tip. Totally will be back for the special.
