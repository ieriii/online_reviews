I'm happy to see this place is finally getting the reviews it deserves. For a long time it consistently had a 3 star average, which annoyed me when I discovered that most of the reviews were based on the fact that it was "too expensive." Perhaps a result of its Grant Park adjacent location? No idea, but this is no 3-star restaurant to me. I've been for both lunch and dinner, and both were fantastic. I would recommend getting anything from the "a la planxa" menu. I've had the scallops, octopus, and several of the meat dishes. Everything was phenomenal, and the sauce that came with the scallops and octopus really was great. I also love the tapas-style food, but it's much higher-end than a traditional "tapas" restaurant. For that reason, some people may be surprised by the cost (either they may think the "portions are small," or the cost doesn't fit the portions), but people need to keep in mind that this is a NICE restaurant, and you're not expected to get one dish per person. It's much higher-end than your typical tapas restaurant, so don't expect to pay the same amount of money, but the food is better. (Is it authentic? No idea. I don't really care as long as it's yummy.) Next up.... I am going to plan ahead and try the suckling pig!
