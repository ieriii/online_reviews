I think I built this up in my mind a little too much beforehand. I'm a pizza fanatic and I'm always trying to find the best pizza of my life. I was told to try Pequod's ASAP. We picked it up and took it home one snowy night. We didn't get meat on it which I think may have been part of the problem. We got the deep-dish style with mushrooms. The crust was AMAZING I'm not going to lie about that. It is burnt a little bit with a glaze they put on which is really delicious. It was the main pizza part that I was kinda disappointed with. I didn't think there was enough cheese or sauce - it was mostly breading. Call me crazy - but I'm just not crazy about Pequod's!
