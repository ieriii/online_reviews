i like san luis because of their speciality: alambres. kind of a mexican stir-fry, but better and more authentic than fajitas, the traditional version has beef, bacon, onions and peppers topped with melted cheese, they also serve a few other combinations. not recommended if you're in a hurry, the service is, shall we say...casual? but very friendly, and the waitress is good about refilling beverages and chip baskets while you wait for your entree.
