We called ahead to make a reservation for a party of 4 at 7:00PM on a Tuesday, and the host informed us that they only have 6:00 or 8:00 available. We took the "offer" and arrived on time, by the time we started our dinner it was around 6:30, and there were still a ton of open table around us. Why being so pretentious? I hate restaurants doing that, even though it's your "marketing strategy". Service is definitely good because there are actually more people working than the number of customers, so service was impeccable. When it comes to the food, I think it was just OK. The manager was nice enough to offer us a couple complimentary appetizers including the unagi watermelon and the baby spring rolls. The unagi watermelon was such an odd combination, the unagi was totally over cooked, not a fan. We also ordered the Kobe beef entree, which does not taste anything close to Kobe beef, come on, seriously? I actually HAD real Kobe beef in Japan and they don't taste like that. We were just disappointed to pay $48 for that kinda quality of 'steak'. The shishito pepper is probably our favourite, very different from Niu Sushi's Shishito Pepper. It's got a little kick but not overly spicy. Desserts were OK, just the regular mo-chi which you can get from the store and the cookie sampler. Nothing to Wow us. Will we return to Sunda? Sure. I don't think it's fair to judge a restaurant base on one trip. I love the decor and it'll always be on my list for drinks, only if they have reservations available.
