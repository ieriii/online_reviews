Kinda out of the way, but all the good joints are! We had the caprese to start, some of the best smoked mozz, I can remember having. And they serve it with bread. I ordered a white pizza with arugala on top of it. Don't remember seeing pizza look like this in Italy, but it was damn good. The crust was perfectly authentic. My friend had the funghi, it was also darn good. Their tomato sauce is not spicy or sweet, tastes just like it should. Didn't indulge in dessert, but from the looks of things, I'm sure it's good. The wine selection leaves much to be desired, but I'll drink any wine you put infront of me.
