Now I've been frequenting Wilde semi-regularly but less for brunch and more for early-to-mid evening drinks and I'm going to be honest...I have some concerns. While I love that Wilde has Magners on tap (which is great), their wine list is short and uber-expensive. C'mon Wilde...throw me something in the $20 range for Cripe's Sake. Seriously. And their food is good...but the portions (which are ENORMOUS) might be used to justify the price (which can be ENORMOUS) and I don't need either. I want this place to be our "hangout" place on a regular basis. It's very cozy and the atmosphere is hard to beat (although the last time I was there is was beyond loud). But it's just too expensive for what I'm getting. Please Wilde: Help me walk in through your doors. I want to love you!
