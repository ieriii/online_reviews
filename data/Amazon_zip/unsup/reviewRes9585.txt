The food was great, but nothing top-notch. Supposedly this is a fusion restaurant (Vietnamese+French), but I thought the french component was missing in their dishes. I'd go to restaurants on Argyle for cheaper(yet good) Vietnamese food if I wanted only Vietnamese. The place is really crowded. They jammed in too many tables and chairs, I kept elbowing a person sitting at the next table.
