The Hopleaf is another place in the city that has an amazing atmosphere. The first time I came here was with my roommate and his parents the day after Thanksgiving. It was a great night to be in the city as the Christmas atmosphere was starting to ring in. When you walk in the door you enter the bar which I haven't really experienced yet as I have only come here for the food. You have to walk through the bar to get to the restaurant part. There are two levels of the restaurant. I love the top balcony because it overlooks the level below and you can hear the chatter below but it isn't disturbing. Again this place is very comfortable, I could sit here for hours and just eat and talk. Food = Amazing. Huge beer and wine list. I loved the sausage plate. Four kinds of sausage and pancetta with white baked beans. I ordered the steak and frites. It was very similar to the steak and frites and had when I was in Poland only the frites come with aioli. Which is probably one of the best things ever. Frites and aioli for days. So good. The mussels here are very good. Two kinds: Belgian and then they usually have a mussels special that changes. I talked about this in my Publican review. The mussels here are very good. Nothing to scoff at but again I would say the mussels at the Publican are better. However if I was going out strictly on atmosphere to get mussels I would choose Hopleaf. This is a great place to bring friends because if there is a wait you can just sit at the bar and enjoy the giant selection of beer/wine. It is sort of out of the way, a bit north, but it is worth the journey as you will leave happy.
