I give the Diner three stars for the food and five for the service. I think the food is a bit over-priced for the portion sizes, but if you're a vegetarian or vegan it's great to have this many options. I have had their chili, which is delish, and on my most recent visit I ordered the Bi Bim Bop (I think i just butchered the name) which was a mix of veggies and quinoa. Tasty but not gonna lie, I was still hungry when I finished eating! I also ordered a bloody mary, and for the first time in my life, I had to send something back. It tasted really awful and was undrinkable. I had serious anxiety about telling the waitor but I just couldn't take another sip. Our server was super cool about it and didn't charge me for it-don't worry I tipped well.
