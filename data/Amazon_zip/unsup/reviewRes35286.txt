Oysters falling from the sky!!!! A friend of mine is an oyster fiend and she wanted to go to this place to satisfy her craving. They had half off oysters last Thursday and we destroyed four dozen. Our server was very knowledgeable on all of the different oysters. She made sure we were satisfied with everything and that we enjoyed everything. We tried the mojitos and they were not so great especially for the prices they charge. Great menu here and will return to check out more seafood goodies!
