Oh, Hopleaf. You were a first date I was really excited about, but now that it is over, I can't decide if I want to go out with you again. You seemed so perfect before we went out, but now I'm not sure if you'll ever live up to your potential. When we arrived we were informed there was no beer on tap because of a flood in the basement. Ok, we said, no problem, shit happens, we'll order off the extensive bottle beer menu. But then we were told they were out of all the beers we ordered. Um, this is a beer bar? Hopleaf, have you been lying about who you really are to get me to come out with you? Then, happy surprise, the beers on tap came back on, and half an hour later we were happily drinking our first beers. But, then, our food order ticket got lost, and we waited over an hour with our drinks and the server never checked in with us. We finally flagged him down and he confessed our ticket had been lost. When our food finally arrived it was mostly delicious, but way, way over-salted on the quail and mashed potatoes. The rabbit salad was superb, however. To make up for all the waiting and errors and such, the server did buy us a round of drinks and a free dessert. And he didn't lie about the mess up, which was much appreciated. Hopleaf, you made a gallant effort to impress me on our first date, but you failed. I want to like you, but my friends don't like you, so I don't think we can ever be a serious item. Maybe we can meet up for drinks sometime during the week.
