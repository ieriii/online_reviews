Hotel Bar Review: I had, quite possibly, the worst bottle of wine to ever cross my lips at the bar attached to the Congress Plaza Hotel. In case you're wondering, it was a 2008 Parducci Pinot Noir. Avoid it at all costs. And the cost? Over 40 bones. Bogus. Other than that, you're just looking at a boring, lame, empty and if I'm being honest, too brightly lit hotel bar. No thanks.
