The fact that people wait in such long lines for this place intrigued me.  I am not a big believer in long waits in line, especially for eggs and pancakes, so we went o a Tuesday morning at 9am. There were more servers standing around talking than patrons eating at tables. The interior is pleasant and inviting. The tables are comfortable and clean. The staff although ample,are not so friendly or attentive. Our server pointed out the juice and tea choices, hovered over us until we placed our orders and then disappeared until he delivered the check. When he returned with the change we asked that my husbands food be wrapped up.  Moments later my husband was handed a container and bag for his food. I can understand the self bagging when the place is busy, but these servers were all just leaning on the coffee bar chatting about life and looking terribly bored. I think he could have packed up the food ! I ordered apple cinnamon pancakes and link sausage. My husband ordered an omelet with poblamo peppers, bacon and cheese. The pancakes were good. They had a nice texture and flavor. The granny smith apple compote was tasty, although the apples were hard and needed to be sauteed longer. The sausage was really juicy and cooked nicely.  My husbands omelet was very tasty, but over done. His potatoes were very good, but nothing "special".   I would eat here again, but on a weekday when there was no wait.  Meli is good, but not good enough to wait in a line.
