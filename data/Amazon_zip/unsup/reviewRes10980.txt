Pizza's one of those foods that I don't think you can do much variety with but Piece has its own flavor that's for sure. My friend and I went on a Monday night, grabbed beers, and a white pizza with chicken, green peppers, and tomatoes. Pizza takes a bit to come out, which makes sense. Didn't really like our seating -- we were squished between tables of 2-4 where it was a hassle to get in and out of our seats. Space inside is large with high ceilings. The bar extends from one side of the restaurant to the other. Saw a couple arcade game machines. I tried their ... something white ale (the title is too long to remember). A sweeter beer -- good because I love beers like Blue Moon. Also got a medium pizza for 2. Took a few slices home.
