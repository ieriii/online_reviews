There's nothing about this place that would make me want to try it again. I ordered the cheese quesadilla for dinner - it had no flavor and was cold. As for the chips and salsa, nothing to rave about either. I found the food to be plain and generic but wasn't expecting to be wowed, so at least i wasn't disappointed. I certainly wouldn't recommend this place to anyone or go back.
