Tasty beer, good pizza. My sister and I split the a New Haven-style pie, which is a style I'd never had before. It was pretty light and tasty---not exactly what I was craving at the time, but I can't really hold that against the restaurant. The brews I tried were most excellent. Not sure it's totally worth braving the crowds or standing for the wait, but if that doesn't faze you, it's a great place to have a meal.
