This place deserves to be egged. When I got there, I was seated in a crowded back corner next to a couple of old hipsters, getting drunk on some over priced wine, and talking about how much they enjoy getting drunk on overpriced wine. And i know this because I was seated several inches from them. I could also tell you the waitsataff's measurements, as their asses were always in my face whenever they had to talk to the drunk hipsters at the other table. When said waiter leaned over my table to address me, the heat from my fondue pot caused him to sweat, leaving my cheese fondue extra salty. But I haven't even mentioned the hot oil--the main course. as the waiter demonstrated to me how to cook the food in the hot oil, he dropped a piece of chicken into the pot. However, this splashed up on my date's face, severely burning him. I had to rush him to the hospital immediately, and I still had to pay full price for my meal. My date still hasn't called me back... When I looked at the prices on the menu, I figured "oh man, its so expensive, this shit HAS to be spectacular, doesnt it?" nope. I could have gotten it all on EBT at the Jewel Osco. If i wanted to dip stale bread in cheese, I would have gone to the little mexican resturant down the street from where i live. My only advice to those who want to come here: dont.
