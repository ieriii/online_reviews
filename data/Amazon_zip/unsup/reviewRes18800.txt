Had lunch here on a lazy Sunday and was able to get a reservation on OpenTable last minute. It definitely has a pub feel but still very upscale-y. For starters, my gf and I had the poutine, which neither of us had ever had. Let's just say it's like cheese fries but way better. There's fries/potatoes, a small amount of gravy, cheese, and some boar meat. Don't even think about it. Just get the poutine for an appetizer. For the main course, I got the Venison Burger and my gf got the soup of the day and roasted turkey sandwich. Polar opposites. Venison Burger was hearty, heavy, a great piece of meat and cooked a real Medium Rare (not Medium like most other places do it). The soup of the day was a honeydew, grape, crab mix with an apple, brie, and turkey, very light but great tasting. I'll definitely be coming back to try more items off the menu, probably for dinner.
