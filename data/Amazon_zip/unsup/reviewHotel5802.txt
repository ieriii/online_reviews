This place was as good as it get, very reasonable and affordable. I recently moved into Chicago for the Occupy movement, and found that this place meets all my needs. The staff was very kind and warming and even helped me to my room with my bags. I would recommend this beautiful hotel to anyone looking for a great place to spend the night.
