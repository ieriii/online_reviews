I've lived in the neighborhood near Opart for over 10 years and have been eating there regularly longer than that. It's consistently good. I most often get:  Yum Neau (beef salad) it's so tasty. The lime dressing is to die for - get a side of rice to soak it all up. I've tried beef salad at countless other thai places over the years and theirs is by far the best. The quality of the beef is fantastic. Tom Yum Chicken soup. Again, had it many times over elsewhere but it's never better than here. Citrus-y with lots of flavor - and no tomatoes! I don't know if tomatoes are typical in Tom yum but it kills it for me when they do. Nam Sod - another salad. This time, ground chicken. Lime dressing. Get a side of rice. I could go on. It's the best service is good though I must say, as much as I go in there and order take out they could acknowledge me. There's never any 'oh, hey, how are you?' or when I call in the order they never punch my number into the computer and ask 'the usual?' but hey, I guess they are too busy making awesome food.
