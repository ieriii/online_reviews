I LOVE CARNIVALE! the decor, service, food, drinks, ambiance, IT'S AWESOME! i've been here a couple of times and every visit, is as good as the last. mojitos are yumm. guac is yumm. arepa is yumm. ropa vieja is yumm. tuna ceviche is yumm. churrasco is yummtastic! it makes you wanna dance every time you take a bite. polla is yumm. bistek palomilla is yumm. fried yucca is yumm. wow, i think i've tried almost half of the things on their menu. for first timers at carnivale, i recommend mojitos, guac, churrasco and the gigantic 3 layered (guava, mango, pistachio) ice cream cake! yum yum yum~ happy eating!
