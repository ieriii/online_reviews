I'm always a little bit late to the party, both literally and figuratively. Everyone has been gushing about Gilt Bar for a long time but I just finally made it there last weekend. It has been on my list for ages but the idea of waiting and waiting to get in, let alone get a table, has always led me somewhere less swanky. This past weekend, however, I was in the area thanks to my generous boss who had gifted me with a overnight stay in a downtown hotel, and decided to try GB out. We started at the bar with one of the very tasty champagne drinks. A couch in the lounge opened up and we were seated fairly quickly for a Saturday night--within about 30 minutes. The little couch area was uber romantic and my girlfriend and I were both wishing we were there with dates rather than each other. But, we made the most of a very lovely atmosphere. We started with a Caprese Salad with toast and the roasted garlic in balsamic vinegar and oil, both served with about a loaf of bread each. Had we known we would've ordered just one. That is a lot of bread for two girls who really should be watching our carbs. Ooof. Of course we ate all of it. That roasted garlic was amazing, and besides, I was not with a guy so I went for it. My girlfriend doesn't care about my garlic breath and stuffing a whole loaf of bread down my gullet. Continuing with our carbo-load, we each ordered one of the homemade pastas. She had the truffle oil pasta (TO.DIE.FOR!) and I had the Parmesan and pecorino pasta. Both were amazing and I've been thinking about them ever since. I've got a return trip to Gilt Bar on my brain for when I can round up some handsome fella to take me there. Loved it.
