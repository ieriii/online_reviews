I went for brunch during a weekday. There was no wait and the service was good.  The beef fat fries are good here, and most of the breakfast options are really good and won't break the bank.  I had the fried chicken and waffles. The chicken was hot, tender and juicy. It wasn't overwhelmingly salty either which I appreciated. The waffles were good and kept well. The sweet potato hash was really creative and complemented the chicken and waffles well. The bar is nicely stocked with a lot of drink options too. Overall, this is a really nice chill place to eat.
