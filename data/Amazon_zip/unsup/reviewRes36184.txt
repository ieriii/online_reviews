I've been to Meli half a dozen times or so for breakfast and today was my second foray there for lunch. They excel at all things breakfast, but today I just wasn't feeling "egg-y," so I decided to go with a salad instead of breakfast for lunch, as I usually do. I should have known better. My friend opted for an omelette and as soon it was set down, I had food envy and looked at my Cobb salad and was disappointed. I'll toot my own horn here and say that I happen to prepare the best darn Cobb salad this side of the Brown Derby, but Meli's wasn't all that. It had the standard Cobb fixin's (bacon, bleu cheese, hard-boiled egg, tomatoes) but the roasted turkey that came on it was sliced, like deli meat, and not cubed. It was weird. I am used to chunks of turkey or chicken in my Cobb, so the gigantic, thin slices of it laid across the top made it less than desirable for me. It was kind of a "blah" salad, which is difficult since a Cobb has so many naughty ingredients--it should be bursting with flavor. It was not. I do love Meli for breakfast and brunch; I've never had a bad morning meal here. I'll stick with ordering off the breakfast menu from now on when I come here. Omelettes, frittatas, french toast - you name it, it's all top-notch. Luckily, I work close enough to Meli to be able to come here during the week. I just can't stomach the waits on the weekend of upwards of 45+ minutes. As much as I love Meli for breakfast, if I'm going to wait that long for a table, I'm going to my first love, M Henry.
