just as i imagined it to be AWESOME!!!!!! The Foie Gras topped dog is a must, never had Foie Gras and believe me this alone is well worth the wait; the foie gras jumps in your mouth and is so pronounced i can't explain in words you simply have to taste it. Also the fries are well done and nicely salted which works well with the hotdogs. The owner was very friendly and professional and really enjoys what he is doing. i simply love this place and will definitely go back for some more !!!!!
