After hearing about the new "revolution", friends went this past weekend. We had a great time. we picked a variety of appetizers - mussels, potato cakes and the bacon dripped cheese popcorn. The popcorn was great, but I was afraid of the bacon drippings, and bacon...but I still sampled it and enjoyed it very much. The potato cakes were absolutely delicious...I could order it just for my entree. Didn't try the mussels..Ordered the hamburger with the egg on it...man, was it good...the bun, made there at revolution, was magnificent...the burger big and tasty. Others in my group ordered the pork chops and the pizza. All reported good things... Now, as you all my know, I am not a beer drinker...give me my apple martini and I am happy. But after my experience at Kuma's, I thought, Barbara you are going to a Brewery, order beer. So I did. Had the Workingman Mild and enjoyed it very much. Sampled a beer hat had "french" in its name and did not like it. But will have the Workingman Mild when I go back...please note: I did notice on the menu that they have specialty drinks...one with cherries and tennessee bourbon got my attention...i may have go back again just to try this one. The design and decor of the Revolution Brewery were fantastic. Greeted bythis greet beer bottle chandelier ( the host told me that there were 99 beer bottles in it) to the actual brewery in the rear, the restaurant is great. The bar with its Fists was a piece of art...I kinda expected to feel uncomfortable in a brewery, since I am not a beer drinker. But i loved it...learned about the whole process of brewing andfelt very comfortable in the restaurant. The wait staff were on target all visit...friendly and helpful. I will definitely go back, probably many times.
