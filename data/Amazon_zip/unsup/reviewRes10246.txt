My favorite Italian restaurant in the city! I've been dining at Piccolo Sogno for both lunch and dinner since they opened...never had a bad service or meal... This place if always busy; the service always exceeds my expectations, and the food never disappoints. Ricardo is a top server at Piccolo Sogno and always takes great care of us (my boyfriend and I and sometimes a group)...he is very knowledgeable about the menu and makes great recommedations. All their pastas are made in-house; my favorite one is Straw and Hay (homemade green and yellow pasta with veal ragu)...also the Pappardelle with Boar Ragu is amazing...perfect comfort food for a cold winter... My favorite bread basked in the city! Rich olive oil and balsamic on the table...can't get enough... My favorite wood-burning oven pizza in the city as well...Bianca Con Ruccula (parmesan and arugula topped pizza) is the best. Huge wine list...all Italian...and a great by the glass selection. Can't wait til summer when the patio opens...looking forward to long lunches and nice romantic dinners with my boyfriend. Thanks to Tony and Ciro for always been hospitable.
