Tru was the one restaurant I really wanted to go, but missed out on during my first food trip to Chicago. When I finally did go I was pleased I waited because they recently introduced a Sommelier's Collection where the wines have at least equal importance. The Sommelier's Collection has one more course than the Chef's Collection which my girlfriend went with The Sommelier's Collection: Amuse: Jasmine-Scented Pear - Fennel Parmigiano-Reggiano, Smoked Paprika 01 SC: Grape Gelee - Crab Salad, Cucumber, Honeysuckle 02 SC: Veal Sausage - Sunchoke Cream, Celery, White Peppercorn 03 SC: Pheasant Consomme - Pomegranate Gelee, Cote De Brouilly 04 SC: Pork Belly - Corn Pudding, Granny Smith Apple, Pickled Leeks 05 SC: Hot and Cold King Oyster Mushroom - Avocado, Grapefruit, Caviar 06 SC: Smoked Bass - Carrot Puree, Harissa Panisse 07 SC: Venison - Blood Orange, Cocoa, Condensed Black Olive 08 SC: Bison Ribeye - Smoked Paprika, Blackberry, Parsnip, Malabar Spinach 09 SC: Duet of Brillat Savarin 10 SC: Red Wine Sorbet - Passionfruit Caramel, Plantain Chip 11 SC: White Chocolate Mille-Feuille - Apricot, Lychee, Strawberry, Cinnamon Mignardises and Lollipops The quality of the food seemed to vary wildly from dish to dish, with the standouts being the Pheasant Consomme, Pork Belly, and Bison and the low points being the Smoked Bass and Venison. Overall I enjoyed the Sommelier's pairing even though I thought the execution was a bit off.
