I heard many good things about this place prior to going... I was told it was the new cool hangout to be at... I've been a few times for drinks, not a real outright dinnner... we found an empty table in "the library" area...which turned out to be a great and cozy table. and we didn't wait at all for it, apparently the bar area is a free for all... had a good time. drinks were good, and service was very prompt and friendly. the place itself was pretty unique. had quite a vast mix of people. the people who told me they loved it were all gay... the place seems to draw a lot of gay people, but a lot of straight people and families alike (complete with a trixie who for some reason thought she needed to bring her baby with her, including giant stroller and all??? completely out of place honey). then the wheelchaired granny was a table or two over too. the table next to us that was leaving offered us a beer they had just gotten but hadn't drank any of...  (maybe they were hoping for some roofie action?).  so it was pretty cool that people were actually not all the same, and mingling with other tables even. the decor of this place is very warm, woody... bathrooms are the best of tile outlet. i did have some food another trip... it was kinda averageish pub food if you ask me...  it was some appetizers, not an outright meal. my friends who went for an actual meal told me about the same thing though... i'll go back!!
