2 stars for service and organization, 4.5 stars for the beer.  I've been to this place 3 times over the past 3 years, and I have never had a good service experience. The worst service experience was 2 weeks ago when I went in with 2 of my buddies. We all love craft beer and supporting local business. It was my buddy Josh's first time at Revolution, and we raved about the atmosphere. We walked-in, no tables. They put us at a beer barrel that served as a quasi table to stand around. 5 minutes later, server acknowledges us, says he'll be back to take our order. Said server goes and chats it up with the receptionist. 10 minutes later, still no server, and we are thirsty. We walk-up to the bar, and bartender informs us that we are in a server section, so he can't serve us. Next, we see an open table, and ask the receptionist if we can sit there instead. She responds, that we can only sit at the table if we are ordering food. This would make sense, if it were not for the fact that we were all going to order at least 3-4 beers/person at $6-$10 per piece. 5 minutes later, we left. So; 20 minutes and no service. So, bad and most likely 1st and last experience for Josh, and ruined opinions on the bar/restaurant side of RevBrew. I'll come back for the beer and for friendly and knowledgeable bartenders, but I'll pass on everything else.
