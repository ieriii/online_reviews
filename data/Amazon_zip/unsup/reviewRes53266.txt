After hearing countless raving reviews for this place, my partner and I decided that it was worth spending 2 hours of our short weekend trip to Chicago lining up for a Saturday night dinner at Fronterra. We were satisfied, but not impressed, and would not return. The service was OK, the atmosphere was loud, and the food was just alright. Not worth all the hype that it receives. We started with the goat taquitos, which were delicious. We then had the skirt steak tacos and one of the shrimp entres, both of which were just OK (not worth a 2 hour wait). Overpriced, overrated Mexican food. An average experience, not worth all the fuss though.
