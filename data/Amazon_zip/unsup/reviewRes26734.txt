OMG I LOVE THIS PLACE!!!!!!!!!! First found out about this place about 1-2 years ago when i was hanging out with some cast members from Second City. They recommended it and then my GF and I decided to go there one late night since they open til like 2am or something like that. Frickin good pizza.  Have ordered a pizza from there from where i live, which is Lombard, and it was worth the drive. Yum. My friends and I always order pizza from here whenever we feel like some pie whenever we are in the city. My last visit i also tried their cookies, that stuff is good too, big and tasty (that's what she said).  Anyway this place is great. Love it Love it Mahal.
