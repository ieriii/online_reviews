I really hope this place never closes. It's one of the few good Thai restaurants in the neighborhood. GREAT presentation with the sushi and dishes. Everything I've tried is very tasty and has its own take on Thai and Japanese. It definitely can get very crowded since it is such a small space - call ahead and ask them to reserve a table. Very well priced and a nice atmosphere. Go here! EDIT: I've become a lot more descriptive in my reviews so here goes: My favorite sushi here are the V Tempura, Caterpillar Roll and Summer Passion. They have specials as well. I tried the Indie Maki which was an option available in the restaurant. From what I can remember, it was very good. Sushi will run you from $4 (nigiri) - $18 (rolls at the most expensive price) depending on what you order. Almost everything I've had on the Thai side of the menu has been very tasty. My favorites are: Sweet Basil Chicken, Panang Curry and the Drunken Noodles. Those will run you around $7 - $11. They have good appetizers too. Everyone seems to like the Crab Rangoon which are pretty small unfortunately. :( The strawberry mochi is an excellent way to end your meal. It is BYOB. Parking is a hit or miss in this neighborhood. There are metered parking spaces on Broadway and Thorndale. You are better off trying a weeknight to come here. I recommend that you come in for sushi as opposed to calling for delivery. The thai menu is good for delivery if that is what you really want.
