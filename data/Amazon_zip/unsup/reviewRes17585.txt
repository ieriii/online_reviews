gave it another shot and went for weekday lunch buffet... i'm still in the same boat - salt overpowers spice. this is however, one of the cleanest, well stocked lunch buffets. my friend loved the butter chicken. it actually smelled amazing and not as salty as my vegetarian dishes. i did try the dal this time which i thought to be very good. i think once you try jaipur (on randolph) nothing else really compares!
