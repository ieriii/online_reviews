Had a great experience at Big Jones. The food was amazing and the bartender makes some fabulous drinks. The place was super busy but we were seated promptly for our reservation. My favorite dish was an appetizer - the Crawfish Gnochhi. Also had a fried chicken salad that was superb. The batter on the chicken was addictive. Shrimp and grits were tasty, tasty, tasty. All in all, a great dining experience for a special occasion or when you've got some money to burn. I am still craving everything...
