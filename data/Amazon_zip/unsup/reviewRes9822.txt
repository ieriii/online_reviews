This is such a unique and fun place! The inside is very cozy and warm. The cuisine is French/Vietnamese and it is amazing! They have some very interesting combinations which I have never heard of before. I got a roasted chicken in a chili pepper sauce with sticky rice on the side. My roomate for a vegetarian dish which was amazing! I had a great glass of Shiraz wine and just really enjoyed my time here! The menu is a bit pricey but it's worth it! They also have some great deserts-especially the chocolate pie. I highly recommend this place!
