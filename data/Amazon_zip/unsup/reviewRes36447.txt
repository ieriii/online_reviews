I miss this place. So. Much. Prior to being the Indie Cafe, there were several other restaurants in this location, none of which stayed open for long. I think all of Edgewater rejoiced when Indie opened its doors and we found really great food there. It's awesome that they're still open, and they've even expanded. Indie has proven time and again that good sushi doesn't have to be expensive (or pretentious). The Thai options are excellent as well. I am always amazed at the beautiful way they plate the food, because you feel like you're in a super swanky restaurant and should be paying way more than you are. To make it even better, it's BYOB. Great food, and great value for the money. Go here now.
