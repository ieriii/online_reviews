The food is excellent, and the margaritas are STRONG - just the way I like 'em. Seriously, after one I'm buzzed and 2 I'm damn near wasted. On Tuesdays and Thursday, margs are half price - great for a night out with the gang. My only complaint is that the staff is sometimes too attentive - every five minutes a waiter stops by to see how we're doing. It's pretty annoying, but I guess it's better than being ignored all night!
