I am debating whether to give this place a 3 or 4 star. Good food, but very oily & salty. almonds - yum, but oily pig's eat with crispy kale - very good bone marrow - burnt bread & too oily pork blade steak - very very good jamon with asparagus - very salty, but it is jamon milk braised pork shoulder - wow butterscotch budino - too sweet sicilian iris - good This place reminds me strongly of Spain, I have to say I like the dishes, but not the oiliness.
