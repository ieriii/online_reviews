First time trying Sushi X...The place was packed, had to wait 30 minutes for a seat, weird artwork on the walls, no alcohol...all of which didn't matter when I tried my first bite of a roll - the double stack.Loved it. And the red dragon. And the carpaccio. And the ceviche.Yes, the place is small, parking is tough (ride a bike!), service was not exceptional (but the waitresses were busy, I can understand that), yes, the artwork on the walls were a bit of a shock but now having eaten there, I can sense that's part of the restaurant's personality.Bottom line: the food was delicious, and within budget for me.
