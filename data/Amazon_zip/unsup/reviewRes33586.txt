I've found my falafel paradise and it checks in under $4. Giant falafel sandwiches filled with fresh, spicy goodness. More than enough to make my stomach happy for the rest of the day. First thought after my first bite into that soft pita, warm, crispy falafel and cool, crunchy cucumber? When can I come back? I split a "small" hummus with a coworker and we marveled at the quantity and ate until we were absolutely stuffed. Service was fast and friendly with the guys behind the counter letting us know answers to our questions quickly without being rude or impatient. I'm a fan. The atmosphere is cozy and I love the personal booths with pretty chandeliers. Our booth was right next to the salad bar which at $5.99 per pound, was quite a deal from all the fresh goodies we could see. At these prices and a location not far from my office, I think I might become a regular.
