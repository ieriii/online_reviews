With the growing number of high-end brew pubs in Chicago serving amazing beer, I had high expectations for Revolution. I was NOT disappointed. The staff was friendly and professional but relaxed and approachable. The menu had me a bit flustered as I found several items that I REALLY wanted to sample, but that is by no means a complaint. I liked the layout of the place, casual but classy. I was pleasantly surprised to see how toddler friendly this place was at 6:00 on a Friday. They even had changing stations in the Men's Room, which to a stay-at-home dad like me is a God-send. My meal was great. I had the calamari appetizer. Great flavors, if a tiny bit small in size. I had the fish and chips. It was good. The fish had a crispy batter that covered a steaming hot piece of fish.The fries were great, not too salty and wonderfully crisp. I had a Workingman, an English Luncheon style brew. Described as low alcohol and lots of flavor, it would definitely be great with a burger or just about anything else on the menu. I will definitely be back.
