A tasty little discovery. We originally went to Division to stop at Renegade Handmade next door. After shopping we were looking for a place for a coffee break. We though Milk & Honey was a cool place so we ended up returning the next day for breakfast. The next day the place was packed, so we knew we made a good choice. Fortunately, when we arrived there was a just cleared table, so we were able to enjoy breakfast without a long wait. I tried the breakfast panini with egg and bacon, while my girl opted for the orange brioche french toast. the panini was fresh and not greasy. Plus, you cannot go wrong when you combine egg, cheese, bread and bacon. The french toast was a little different, but good. The subtle sweetness of orange was unexpected. We shared a side of chicken sausage which was a little spicy and really good. We would definitely eat here again.
