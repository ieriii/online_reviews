My mom and I were driving by here on a Saturday morning about 10:30. I guess she's never driven by here to witness the throngs of Hot Doug's disciples that line the street waiting for their encased meat fix. My mom, who's naturally funny, asked what everyone was standing in line for: "Is it a soup kitchen line for hipsters?" I almost crashed my car from laughing so hard.
