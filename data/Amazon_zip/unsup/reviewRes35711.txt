So after reading and rereading the reviews of Sun Wah, I knew I had to go immediately. Well, after this week, the hubby and I needed to celebrate our successes so I told him we were coming here. I had talked it up to him for a while so he was intrigued as well.  We came. We ate. We conquered. Words can not describe how succulent the duck was. The crisp, fatty skin dripping with the juices of the duck. The tender, moist meat tickled my taste buds as I ate. The buns with the radishes, scallions and carrots heightened the flavor of the meat. I pretty much devoured those. The soup with the left over duck and the duck fried rice came next. We gorged ourselves on the duck that we hardly made a dent in the other two dishes. We did try it and wow, everything was top notch. And the duo sorbet of mango and raspberry really rounded off our rich meal. Talk about getting three more meals out of it. Definitely worth the price tag of $32.  We thought coming here early on a Saturday would have been the best time. Although we had a great time chatting, we did have to wait over an hour for our duck and when the duck came, the woman who carved wanted to make sure our first time would be great. The way she was talking gave us the impression that she may have been an owner or one of the owners. We could tell the kitchen was slammed with orders of the Peking Duck.  Needless to say, the long wait and the lack of service did not deter us from discussing when we would be coming back. And trust us, we will be back very soon!
