HEAVY~ The deep dish pizza is HEAVY. My boyfriend and I can eat, but the deep dish, can't even fish one slice. If you order the 10", have at least 3-4 people there to help you finish. Price is descent. Overall, it was alright. Got to try out if you are in Chicago right? I waited for 30 minutes, if you have time, give it a try;)
