This hotel wasn't exactly what I was expecting based on the reviews I read. First things first...go to the lobby for free wine! You can't go wrong with that. But, to my dismay, there was no thumping techno...in fact, often there was no music piped in a lot of the time. When there was music piped in, it was lame pop/rock and it was not the same music as you moved through the elevator/lobby-lounge/bathrooms off the lounge area. Even though the decor was swanky and AWESOME, the music really sucked the energy out of the spaces for me. Our room was tiny but pretty. The subway tile in the bathroom is gorgeous and pairs well with the baby blue ceiling. All the mirrored surfaces entertained me. It was nice to have two closets; one for him and one for me. We didn't have bathrobes in our room. Maybe because it was hot outside? I did sleep well here. The two Roman shades allowed me to adjust the lighting in the room when morning rolled around.  It was impossible for two people to get any work done with the amount of surface area available, so I wouldn't recommend planning to work from a standard size room here. The location was very convenient to the freeway, but not as convenient to Chicago hotspots. Things seemed to close early around us. In short, I have mixed feelings about this hotel. It's chic and boutiquey, but I think I want to try somewhere else next time I'm in Chicago.
