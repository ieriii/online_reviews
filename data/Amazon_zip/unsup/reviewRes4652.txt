Came here with a large group and each ordered 2 dishes so here's what we got: Fried Olives- these were so so, not impressive. I'd skip this. The big tail was delicious, probably something i would want for myself :) The meatball slider- not bad. It's your average meatball with bread. Deviled egg was good- a bit difficult to share with 6 people. The pig ears were amazing!!! I've been here 3 times already and never had this. I don't know how I've missed this. The foie grois pt was amazing Pork shoulder was tender and Tasty Pork blade steak was enormous. Pork neck Gravy with ricotta cheese spread was good too. Caesar salad- Id skip Prosciutto de Parma type 2 was so so. All this food for six people- this was more than enough. I feel you can get more bang for you buck here compared to Girl and the Goat. Must haves: pig tail, pig ears, shoulder blade was good value and the prosciutto. Done. Total bill 169- 35 a person with tip. This sure beats the 100 per person at G&G!
