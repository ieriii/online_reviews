I spent New Year's Eve here and had a spectacular time! First the bar in the lobby had some great drinks. The empire room didn't have anything going on so my date and I went in and talked and slow danced and then went for more drinks. We didn't make reservations for dinner so had dinner at the Lockwood. Great service. My food was okay and my date's was phnomenal! He took me on a tour of the place and told me about some of the history. And of course the lobby is breathtaking. I'm not so sure why so many people are unhappy with their rooms because there's so much to do outside of the room - how much time do you really spend in there? We spent about 5 hours total between getting ready and having breakfast and a catchin a few zzzzz's. The bed was sooo comfortable! And the showers get really hot and have good water pressure. It was enough room for two people to relax and not feel cramped. My only gripe is that we ordered some room service and we paid $40 for 4 half sized diet cokes on ice. And heads up! Any room service you order there is a fee and a tip added on for you.... I caught myself tipping my breakfast guy $5+. Had I done that He would have gotten over $12 for rolling our cart up to our room..... Breakfast was good but not $50 good.
