Fantastic salad bar, good feijoada as well. Most of the meat was overseasoned though, exceptions being the flank steak and parmesan crusted pork. Sausage was highly disappointing. The good thing was Eric, our waiter, seemed to take these criticisms quite seriously so perhaps they'll be corrected down the road. He also helped us select a mid-price wine which was quite enjoyable. I would consider going here just for the salad bar. BTW, this may be the largest (in terms of # of seats) restaurant in Chicago...
