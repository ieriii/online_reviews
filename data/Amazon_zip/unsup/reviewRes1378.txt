We disregarded good advice and slept in on the Saturday we were to visit Hot Doug's. We took the bus down Addison to California and walked the rest of the way. You could see the line all the way from the bus stop (3 blocks away). We weathered rain, wind, boring nerdy hiptster convo about Star Wars and other meat-themed restaurants for 2 hours, but we were on a mission. This was an adventure we had planned for.  My boyfriend's a trainer so he had planned to make full use of his professional appetite. This enabled me to sample several dogs: The Chicago Traditional (a classic favorite), Atomic Bomb (I managed one bite- it was stuffed with jalipenos!), Rosemary Chicken (my favorite of the group, savory in true sausage form, the cheese was perfect), The Teuben (tasted exactly like a reuben- so good), Thai Chicken (my BF's fave, but I was grossed by the seaweed- it ain't natural on a dog), and of course, the infamous Duck Fat Fries (good but not so good I need to write home about it). After 2 hours of anticipation, I can say that we weren't disappointed. They had a wide selection of sodas, the decor was amusing and we managed seats on the stools facing the outside window so we got to watch the line.  I will confess, I'm vegetarian for 99% of the week and Hot Doug's was a treat I'll allow myself vary rarely, if ever again. My lack of 5 stars was the hours. I'll even brave the wait if Doug's was open for dinner. Alas, they are not. So, they get my measly 4 stars. Definitely go at least once, but don't expect the speediest or classiest of meals. Just great eats.
