I just had my first dining experience at Sunda and can't believe I waited so long!! My date and I had reservations for 8p but didn't get seated until 8:30. No big deal and fairly normal in Chicago, especially at such a popular venue. We had a drink at the bar and the staff checked on us a couple of times to keep us posted. When the table was finally ready, the hostess surprised us by offering to treat us to a free dessert for our wait. Sounds good to me!  Once seated, they brought out a complimentary noodle dish and we ordered edamame to start. Picked out one of the specials of the evening, which was some kind of fabulous roll that was topped with a seafood mix of crab & lobster, baked, and had a bit of a spicy mayo flavor. It was too die for and our server assured us that they were planning to make it a regular fixture on the menu. Also got the garden veg roll, which was enjoyed even by my carnivorous date. The escolar was fantastic as well, the potato chip giving it quite a surprisingly great twist.  For dessert we chose the ridiculous, which was......ridiculously delicious!! It started off a chain reaction in our row, as everyone looked at the table next to theirs and ordered it as well. It was a tough choice as all of the options sounded great.  I can't say enough positive things about Sunda - great service, polite staff, very innovative and tasty flavors, and a super hip & urban vibe. My only small complaint is that our table was next to a post with a small gap in between that became the walkway for the wait staff. The constant traffic was a bit annoying after a couple of hours, but didn't overshadow what was a wonderful experience. Sunda has risen to the top of my favorite Chicago restaurants!!
