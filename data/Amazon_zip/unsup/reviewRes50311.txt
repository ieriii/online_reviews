Darned it!!!! I HATE it when I LOVE a place and then they go and ruin it. Went in last night for dinner and thought that the Family Style Lenten menu looked good. Not what I might have normally done there, but it looked like a decent amount of food and I could take the kiddos.  Well, something has happened to the service (or they don't ramp up until after 8p). LONG WAITS between courses, mediocre small portions, and just so-so flavor/presentation. The lenten soup was OK, not really that hot when it hit the table. The fritters were doughy on the inside, and the trout was just a general pain in the ass to manage while still being on the bone (with skin, thank you very little). The fish would have been bait on any boat on the lake, but that was our main entree for three of us. Really? Cream puffs were good, not great. $75 out the door for two adults and a child. Still hungry when I left (and damn disappointed).
