After all the hype surrounding this place I found it to be a bit of a letdown. Maybe I've been spoiled by Pita Inn, I don't know, I just didn't see what all the fuss was about. Sure the sandwiches here are pretty big, huge even. Unfortunately it's not something I'd return for regardless of the fact that I "get my money's worth" or not. The Chicken Shawerma sandwich smelled like a sloppy joe, was overly messy due to the excessive amounts of hummus inside (my pita ended up falling apart as I ate it) and was ultimately not fulfilling. I did, however, enjoy the falafels I ordered on the side. They are twice the size of the ones at Pita Inn and just as good. The same goes for the baba ganuj. Even though there's no Pita Inn near me in the city, I'm certainly glad there's one near my place of work. Otherwise I'd never get a decent middle eastern meal.
