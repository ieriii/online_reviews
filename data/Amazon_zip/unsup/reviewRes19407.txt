Total deliciousness. Ordered the white dragon roll, one of the specials, and the soft shell crab appetizer. We split it between two of us, and it was more than enough food. Also, we went on a Saturday night without a reservation, and I had figured there would be a wait, but it wasn't too bad. They told us 45 minutes, but it really only took about 20-25 minutes until we were seated. The lighting is very dim, but it works. My only gripe is that the line for the bathroom is ridiculously long, as there's only one bathroom for women, and one for men. And the fact that some girls take 10 minutes in the bathroom (really? what are you bitches doing in there??) is a little too crazypants for me.
