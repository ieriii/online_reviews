my favorite brazilian steakhouse over Brazzaz. I enjoy sampling the variety of meat, especially the flank steak and the beef ribs. It's soo flavorful and never disappoints me. The gauchos are always attentive. The waiters, eh.. you will see them once in a while. From the salad bar area, the lobster bisque is a must try. I can devour 3 plates of the fried plaintains. The papaya dessert is too creamy, but the cheesecake and creme brulee is good. It's bit pricey, but totally worth it!
