Since I am a recent Sushi convert, I am always up for trying new places. That's why I was especially excited for a girls' night starting at Coast. We had reservations for 7pm on a Friday night. We arrived in a few different waves. I was very shocked at how accommodating they were with getting us an add-on table just for more space.  I was disappointed with the 1 bottle for every 2 people BYOB policy. In my experience, the more you drink the more you eat. But to each their own.  We all ordered appetizers to share for the table, none of which stand out in my mind as wonderful. The asparagus and beef was disastrous when it come to logistics. There was no graceful way to share between more than a few people. The Tropical ceviche was missing something. Nothing was overly impressive. The maki rolls were better. Everyone ordered a roll to themselves and had a few more to share. The White Dragon roll was very good, unique. I also ordered a Philadelphia, but I've had better.  The atmosphere was loud and a bit crowded. The decor is along the normal lines for a trendy sushi place.  Throughout the night, we had a few communications of when our table needed to "vacate." When the reservation was made, it was 9pm. When they sat us down, they said it was 9:15pm. However, at exactly 9:00pm, we were asked to leave. It isn't like we had food still on the table or that our bill hadn't been paid, but a little please and thank you would have made the transition go more smoothly.. After all that said, I think that I will think twice before venturing here again.
