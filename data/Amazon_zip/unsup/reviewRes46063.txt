Oh, Grand Lux, what can I say about you... I dream about your ahi tuna burger. Seriously. And so I forgive you for a lot of things (and give you the first two stars). Unfortunately, the last time I came to you I came with a family that was sunburnt, hungry and fidgety after a hour-long Architecture Cruise. Since my family doesn't exactly do "inventive" cuisine, I suggested you. After a thirty minute wait (at 6:00 pm?), you came through with bread, but appetizer plates that were still dirty from the table before us. Really? Then, after another thirty-minute wait, you fed us a lackluster pizza, way too oily pasta, and Salisbury steak that tasted like it came out of a Stouffer's box.  Sadly, I think this is the end of our affair. Next time, my family and I are moving on a few more blocks... to the Cheesecake Factory.
