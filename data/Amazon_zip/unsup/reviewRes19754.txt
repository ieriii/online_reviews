The Gage is a nice place, it seemed touristy though. Our waitress was nice but it sure took a LONG time for her to bring out our food! She could have at least bought over a few more baskets of rolls if it was going to take that long. I had the scallops, they were really good. The brie potato side and french firies were good as well. The gage burger was good.
