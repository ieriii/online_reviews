Absolutely amazing italian food. The calamari frittura was cooked to perfection (no sauce needed). Also the spaghetti neri "frutti di mare" was quite tasty.The Margherti pizza is great. Try the Tagliatelle di Castagna with wild boar ragu was amazing. Pair it with the a glass of Barbera d'Alba red wine.
