Agreed. Location is great. But there are also a lot of other hotels in the same area. I stayed at this location for a convention being held at the venue. If I had a choice I would have stayed elsewhere...for the following reasons: - Rooms are tiny. They have updated the decor but doesn't make up for the closet feeling room. - Separate charge for internet service. If some motels can provide free wifi why can't you when I pay 3x as much for a stay here? - Split elevators. They have separate elevators for floors 1-28 and another set of elevators for the higher floors. Confusing if it's your first day there or you switched your room several times like I did. - Broken ac/heater functions.  - Foul smell bathrooms. Like they used a dirty cloth and no cleaning solvents to wipe down the inside of the bathrooms. Ewwww On a positive note, the staff was wonderful and really accomodating. If only the building and amenities reflected the cost and service - I would be a happy camper.
