At the very least, go check out the bar. The decor is like an acid trip (not that I've ever done acid--not that there's anything wrong with that). The colors in the bar and dining room are absolutely wild and extremely vibrant. Everything we had was delicious. Three words to remember: tacos, tacos, tacos. I'm not a big taco guy, normally, but these tacos are good--with whatever filling you order.  Drinks are potent and tasty and the service was great, too. The lively ambiance was great, too. I'd go back anytime. It is a lot of fun and the food is creative and hits the spot. I was also extremely impressed with the wine list which was lengthy and very interesting. I was surprised to see so many different wines offered at a Mexican restaurant, but hey, they get extra points for that effort.
