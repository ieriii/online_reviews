I know, I know...you've probably read that same phrase on every yelp pizza place review. But this is the real deal, and I'll tell you why. First off, I live in Bridgeport...so pizza has to be FANTASTIC for me to drive to the north side. Second, they know how to make a real pizza! The caramelized crust is the perfect combination of baked/burnt/carmalization goodness. Also, they know how to put on the toppings. When I want sausage, I don't want little pea sized nuggets of ground beef mixed with table salt and pepper thrown on. I want god damn chunks! A ballet of cheese and toppings and I want to see burned/backed tops as if the sausage was cooked on an open pit flame grill....Pequods does it. I went there recently with a small group of friends and we experimented with a Green Olive, Anchovies, and Jalapeo pizza....WOW! AWESOME! Now the interior does get to be a little sports bar like, but I'm here for pizza so I could give a crap about what game it on. The waitstaff is young and sometimes they're on the slow side...but its pizza! You sit down, order a beer, order the toppings you love...sit and enjoy the greatest pizza you'll ever have.
