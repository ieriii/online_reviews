I went there with a large group for my brother's birthday and was with my parents. I talked to them and they were also very disappointed, especially for the price. I got the garlic and balsamic vinegar bread to start with and it was very good, but for the main dish I got the pot roast. This happens to be the most expensive item on the menu to. Anyways the portion of it was tiny and looking at everyone else's plates the portions were small to. I figured for what they charge there would be more, especially since all the sides are al a cart. The the supposed "spoon tender" pot roast was not that tender and the wine sauce that came with it was also very bad. I had someone else taste it and the agreed. It was "winey" or course but also salty and nothing else. For a side i ordered the smashed potatoes and they they were rather bland. I did try the fries and thought they were good, but hey they are just fried potatoes with salt. For dessert I had a cherry tart with pistachio ice cream, which was good. I guess I was just disappointed in the main course and my dad who is a chef was also disappointed in his pasta dish. My mom got the mussels and she said they were ok but again very small portions. She does not eat very much and was able to finish the whole thing. Also i know its nit picking but no specials or soups offered, and I don't even want to talk about the prices for drinks.
