Cute place which was pretty quiet on a Wednesday afternoon. The water glasses were broken on the top so had sharp edges which was a little bizarre. I had a vanilla latte which came to me in a glass beer mug and my friend had a hot apple cider which he said was delicious. I was disappointed that they serve coffee from NJ instead of Chicago which to me defeats half of the purpose of going somewhere local to have coffee. I also didn't understand why the coffee wasn't in a coffee mug. The service was great though and there seemed to be some good food options on the menu. Will definitely be back for the food, if not the coffee.
