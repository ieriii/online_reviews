Came here with a couple friends the other day and everything was just about alright. I thought that the plate I ordered was actually pretty good, to where my friends said their plates they ordered were a little bland. The one problem that I do have with this place is actually the portions. When it comes to pan asian food, I have an expectation about portion sizes. Now, I understand that Simply It is trying to appear on the upscale side, but it's no reason to skimp on the portions. This is unfortunate, because I would have liked to given possibly four stars, but from the complaints about the blandness and portions, I couldn't. I actually finished the beef, shrimp, and fish on my plate was still so hungry that I wound up eating the garnish on my plate with chili sauce. That wasn't satisfying to say the least. This is also after eating an appetizer as well. So, if you live in the neighborhood, it's worth a try. Other than that, don't go out of your way.
