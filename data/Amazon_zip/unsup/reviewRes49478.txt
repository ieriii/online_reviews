Wine and cheese are the main reasons to go here. We went here for dinner and enjoyed it very much. The menu includes about 6 white wine flights (4 different wines per flight) and 6 red wine flights. You can also order wine by the bottle or the glass. The menu also includes many different cheeses and charcuterie. I ordered the petite platter with camembert, speck, and salami. It came with excellent olives. If you want a more substantial meal, they did have some entrees. Someone else in my group had a burger with fries and another person had the grilled cheese. The gourgeres were really really good. The chocolate spaetzle with strawberries was only ok. The waiters were friendly and helpful without being "wine snobby."
