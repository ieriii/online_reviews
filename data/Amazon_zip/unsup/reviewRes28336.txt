By far my favorite place in Chicago. I've gone several times and service has always been great with or without reservations. My last visit was 7/15. I don't remember the exact name of the cocktails-one was a peach champagne and the other was an orange 'crush' like cocktail which were both fantastic. My guest and I are both vegetarians so we asked the server what was recommended. We had a tasting menu that was not on the menu...Consisting of tofu and edamame fizz. Great presentation and flavor experience. Dessert was a sea-salt chocolate dish which we couldn't finish, but so good. Icing on the cake was the fact that they played LCD Soundsystem throughout the evening. Can't wait to go back!
