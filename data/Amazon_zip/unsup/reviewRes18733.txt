I probably would not have checked this place out if not for their burger reputation. It's got kind of a Lincoln Park, sleek/posh vibe going on, or at least that's how it comes off to me. But, don't let that keep you away from their delicious burgers AND fries. I emphasize their fries because they may actually be the highlight of the place, and they make damn good burgers. Their truffle fries are incredibily delicious and perhaps the best overall option for fries. If you want some kick with your fries, get their chipotle option. They're spicy and very tastey. Oh, and, another thing that drew me into this place was the fact that they serve garlic fries! Garlic fries are a west coast staple, and have been frustratingly hard to find here in Chi for this former SF resident. They definitely hit the spot everytime. Did I mention they make good burgers here? Well, they do. I'm a bit of a carnivore, so I found some of their burger options frustrating. They have a lot of creative options, but at the end of the day, I just want a freaking bacon cheeseburger. I ended up getting the Ole Imperial (with bacon) and I was not disappointed. It was good, real good. I got my baconcheese fix, but with white chedder and porter marinated mushrooms. Ah, it was good. Throw in the truffle fries and a Founders IPA, and it was sweet dreams for this guy. Oh, also forgot to add that they've also got a great craft-brew selection too, which is another added bonus. Overall the food and the beer selection cancel out any negatives associated with the sleek vibe. Good service too.
