I feel a little intimidated to even write a review about this place. I truly believe it is one of the greatest places (perhaps THE greatest) place to get food in Chicago.Don't let the line that wraps around the place turn you away. Bring a book or something, because the wait is WORTH IT!I love that the owner, Doug, takes every person's order.I love that they change their specials frequently- it keeps me coming back for new things to try and for some reason makes me think the food is fresher.I love the quirky, non-threatening atmosphere.Ask for Doug's recommendation, and he will probably tell you to get the Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage with Truffle Aioli and the Foie Gras Mousse. It is incredible. But the other specials have always been just as mouth-watering.My advice, go with a bunch of friends. That way, you have people to hang out with in line. And then everyone could order a different special and get to try a little bit of everything.
