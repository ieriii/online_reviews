Authentic Mexican food with an authentic Mexican atmosphere.  There are 3 La Pasadita locations all right next to each other, and 2 are just quick late night take out spots, while this one is an actual sit down restaurant with menus and servers. My chicken tacos were so good I don't even know how to describe them. It felt like I was back in Mexico getting cooked for in someone's house. Homemade Mexican food at its best.  It's so hard to find places that really taste authentic, but this place does it. I can't wait to visit Chicago again so I can go back for more. I've been craving those tacos since I ate them a week ago. Delicioso!
