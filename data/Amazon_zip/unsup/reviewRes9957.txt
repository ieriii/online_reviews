god i love a great micro brewery! I went with co workers and we had a great time 3 of us shared 2 pitchers of dysfunctional (spelling) and we loved it sooo much!!! the flavor is so beautiful!!!!!! i cant describe it, so aromatic and delicious! we got a margherita style pizza, and i wasnt impressed, but my friend got clams and bacon!!!! it was suprisingly great! im giving 4 stars because i did feel the pizza was a bit pricey for me. but your non stop crowds says otherwise!!! thanks for introducing me to craft beers!!!!
