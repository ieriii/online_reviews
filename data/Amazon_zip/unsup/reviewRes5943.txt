This place gets 5 stars because the manager, Karissa, was super accommodating to a special request I had and went out of the way to make sure the seating arrangement I needed was there. The food alone earns this place 4 stars anyway. Try the ragus, they're awesome and something different than whats at your standard italian place. great experience, i'll be back!
