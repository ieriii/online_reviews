Easily lost in the sensory overload that The Magnificent Mile provides, the Purple Pig is tucked back and to the side of the 500 Building, just above Illinois St. Our group of 6 was told there was a 20 minute wait, but ended up waiting less than 10. Shortly before that, I left to run back to the hotel thinking I had time... my tardiness was not missed by our server, Darma. If you are lucky enough to sit with Darma be prepared for a quick smile, great sense of humor, passion for food, thorough knowledge of the menu and no mercy for late arrivals. The atmosphere is casual with easy conversation at the long table that we shared with another, smaller group. Dim, but adequate lighting and music at a pleasant volume. Once we placed our order the first item came out in a matter of minutes. We shared a number of recommended items, small portions perfect for sharing, with the highlight being the Roasted Bone Marrow & Milk Braised Pork Shoulder. We had about 8-10 different items. I lost count with the great wine & conversation. Everything I tasted was very good and the overall experience was one of the best I've had. Good food, good wine, great service and the company of amazing friends is always winning combination.
