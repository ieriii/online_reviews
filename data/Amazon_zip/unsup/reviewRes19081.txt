The food here is amazing! Since I work in the neighborhood, I go here for lunch fairly often. I have never had a bad meal. Anything with pork is great. My favorite is the Tuesday special - Carnitas. Its a pork sandwich from the wood-buring oven. But I also love the Carnitas Caldo - this great soup with pork, dumplings, chayote, greens and avocado. For dessert, I once had a chocolate fudge covered brownie with bacon. Sadly, I don't think that is on the menu anymore. My only complaint is that the place is so small its usually hard to get a table unless you go early or late. Finally, the offer take out, but that can take a while, too.
