Underwhelmed. A couple of months ago, Graham Elliot abandoned its old menu full of whimsy and moved toward a more streamlined upscale offering, with a strong push toward tasting menus. Bad move in my opinion - the food has lost a lot of what made it stand out from the rest of the Chicago dining scene. I started with the charred octopus. Totally overcooked and not tender at all. The table shared a crab cake, which was good but not particularly memorable. For my entree, I had the skate confit. Really disappointing. I didn't even finish it. I expected a lot better. We got all 3 desserts - the lemon cake blew the other 2 away, but all and all, I'd say that the best thing I put in my mouth was the truffled popcorn waiting on the table upon arrival. That's the Graham Elliot I like. As an aside - wine here is pricey, with most bottles around the $100 mark. We decided on a tempranillo for $70 -- it may have been the least expensive red on the menu (and retails for $20-$23). The beauty of malbec/tempranillo/roija is that they are consistently good for a lower price point. In other words, our $70 tempranillo was no better than the Paso A Paso I hoard from Kafka wines (*best wine shop ever, by the way). The decor is cool and modern and our servers were excellent. I just really don't like the direction ge is moving in. It feels like perhaps Mr. Bowles has become more focused on his celebrity chefdom than pushing the culinary envelope. WIth amazing new restaurants popping up weekly, ready and willing to take his place, I don't see myself coming back any time soon.
