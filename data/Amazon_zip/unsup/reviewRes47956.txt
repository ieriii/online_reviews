Great service! The place has a nice ambience and when I told the host that I was taking my boyfriend there for his birthday, the whole staff treated us like celebrities. Everyone was very accommodating and nice and the food is really good. I had a great time, and am very grateful to Raymond for helping make the dining experience a great one.
