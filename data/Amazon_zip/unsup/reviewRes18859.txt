Wanted to pile on to the awful ketchup tirades. Have been here half a dozen times, and have been pleased with the burgers, but always forget how much I hate the ketchup until it is too late. However, I decided to go on Sunday and brought a tiny little Tupperware of Heinz with me. I pulled it out and mentioned to the bartender that I BYO'd - "do you mind?" She got quite an attitude, telling me that she wished I hadn't done that, their chef puts a lot of time and effort into making the ketchup and she "realizes a lot of people don't like it" but basically that I should deal. My boyfriend was surprised I even asked, but I thought it was the polite thing to do. I didn't think I was making a crazy request, nor did I deserve to be lectured. So I put it back in my purse, attempted to eat their terrible "ketchup" and made a resolution not to go back anymore. Try Jury's one block north, or Sola's down on Lincoln past Irving.
