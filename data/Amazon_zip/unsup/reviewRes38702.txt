This is a great pub with a great atmosphere and wonderful beers and ales. I agree that it can get pretty loud, but it's a pub and people don't whisper in pubs. If you go with this in mind, you'll have a great time. When you take a look at the menu, you'll notice their specialty: Mussels for One & Mussels for Two. My wife and I have a "mussels for your birthday" tradition we started since we met 8 years ago and the mussels at The Hopleaf are by far the best we've had in town. The super plump & tasty mussels are offered in two broths-- a beer-based and a white wine-based. We've tried both and while i feel the white wine broth is my fave (with slivers of garlic and bacon) my wife prefers the beer-based broth (she's not into the smokey bacon flavor.) The mussels are served with frites that are cooked perfectly with great texture, crunch, just the right amount of salt and a little bowl of aioli that you can't get enough of. Other fares we're fond of are the escargot and the sausage platter. These are both appetizers that we've gotten when we've dropped by the HL for a quick drink and snack. If you've got a real sweet tooth (I'm more of a savory man mysself), I'd suggest you stay away from the desserts. That being said- I've also had the carrot cake and although it was odd to taste the Pere Jaques beer-based raisin sauce, I totally "got" it from the second bite on. Very rustic and organic. The beer list is one of the best I've yet to find in the city. Belgian, French, regional and national micro-brews will leave any discerning beer aficionado happy and any novice contemplating who the real king of beers should be.
