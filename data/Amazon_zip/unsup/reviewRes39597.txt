Everything we had was perfect.  The tuna was ok too.  The service was good and despite what people say about the saff not speaking engrish, they did a fine job. Have the ricecake beef soup and their miso is amazing - i dont even like miso. I'm hungry now thinking about the seafood pancake leftovers that I tossed this afternoon :( Bad idea, shoudl always wait til snacktime the next nite before throwin out leftovers. Open 10a til 5a daily....not 24 hours, but no one needs much more than that anyway....
