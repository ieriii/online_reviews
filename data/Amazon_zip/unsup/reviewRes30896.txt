Old school vegetarian I'm not the biggest fan of food pretending to be something its not, like vegetables and grains pretending to be meat. Inferiority complex? Meat doesn't pretend to be vegetables or grains. Own it, vegetables! Having said that, I do think the Chicago Diner has a lot to offer, and even more so is probably the premiere vegetarian restaurant in the city. They should be, they've been doing it for a very long time, even before it wasn't cool to be a vegetarian and even after it was. I would recommend avoiding things pretending to be something they aren't and to stick with the wonderful and creative vegetarian dishes that say "I'm a vegetable! Eat me!"
