Wildfire is a good steakhouse that is not too expensive. The food is tasty and the drinks are even better than the food! I can always count on Wildfire for a good cosmo. I think they make the best cosmo I have had at any restaurant. They don't skimp on the liquor! I've been here twice. Each time the food and drinks didn't disappoint. Their spinach and artichoke fondue is delicious as an appetizer. Of course, for the entree, I got steak....the NY strip, with a bleu cheese crust is mouthwatering. I love the atmosphere at this near north location. The space is open but it's warm and intimate at the same time. It's a lively place to go after work. Three stars because of the service. It's always slow.
