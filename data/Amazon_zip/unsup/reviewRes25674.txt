Geja's Cafe made my first fondue experience a pleasant one. Although I was not seated at a booth, I did not find the table seating to be too "cozy" because the table was located in the back corner of the restaurant. That being said, it was particularly dark in that area because there was no lighting overhead. I would highly recommend bringing a flashlight (I did, and that made cooking a lot easier because I could tell when the food was fully cooked!). The service was excellent. Our waiter kindly explained how everything worked, and told us about any additional charges (e.g., $8 plate-sharing charge). I only ordered one premier dinner (the Prince Geja Combination), which proved to be enough to satisfy two people. The cheese fondue was excellent. I didn't think it was too rich, which is usually my main concern with dairy foods. The main course had at least two of each of the meat options, and a good assortment of vegetables. I was not bothered by the smell of the oil, and only noticed it when I sat down. The oil never splattered out of the pot. The chocolate fondue was not very special, but I still enjoyed it. The waiter even brought out a chocolate-covered pound cake for my special occasion, on the house. Definitely two thumbs up for service!
