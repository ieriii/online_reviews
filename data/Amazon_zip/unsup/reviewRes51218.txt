Blackened salmon, braised greens (slightly too salty) but well flavored, heavenly mac and cheese has completely won me over. Wish I had room left to try one of their desserts but I will be back Simply delicious. This is southern food that is full flavored in a relaxing atmosphere with delightfully personable wait staff. Ask for "Jenny". She kept us smiling throughout our visit.
