I live in Andersonville, and often walk to the restaurants and pubs nearby. My wife and I hit this place at least 3 times a month at various times. The food is reasonably priced, delicious and healthy. Yes, the service can be a bit slow, but for those of you who've visited Europe or Northern Africa, cafes are SUPPOSED to leave you alone to enjoy your conversation and food. If you're a typical rushed American who needs to get in and out (as I've been on a number of lunches), simply flag down a server--no big deal. The owner is also quite a character, and fun to talk to. I think he's French Algerian. Final note: I brought my entire family in once (about 12 people) with individuals from out of town. They loved the place. Bottom line: Great food, good prices and friendly staff.
