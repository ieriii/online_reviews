So perhaps my expectation for Frontera were a little too high given all the hype that Rick Bayless has gotten but I wasn't overly impressed with Frontera. I do admit, the food was good, but not out of this world. I went here with my team from work for lunch I ordered the pork tenderloin - which came and looked like the chef had lovingly sliced each pork tenderloin piece. It was so delicate and each piece was tender and juicy. Plus it came on top of this delicious spicy mole sauce with a small corn tamale on the side with a dallop of creme fraish. My other two co workers ordered the tamale of the day (goat) which I had a bite off. Again it was good, but not of this world. I was most disapointed in the gucamole that took over 30 minutes to get to our table and I found it lacking in taste and the texture was a little too thick for my liking. I would be willing to give Frontera another try and would love to check out XOCO, but let's just say I am not exactly chomping at the bit to go back.
