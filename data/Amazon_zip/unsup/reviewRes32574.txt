I have eaten here twice and I am not a big sushi guy. The first time I ate at Sunda I did a variation of the miso soup and had the firecracker. I was not a fan and did not like my food or the service the first go around. The server seemed as though she was not on top of the things, she messed up a very basic set of orders but did apologize profusely for her mistakes. The second time at Sunda I did the miso soup, dragon roll and the beef dish entree (cant remember the name off the top of my head was steak like with awesome seasoning maybe wagyu, would have to look at the menu) that meal was unbelievably good. The beef was excellent, the dragon roll was much more my speed and the miso of course was miso.  What I learned from my two trips at Sunda is that you need to order lots of different things off the menu. Try everything you think looks good because the portions are not large. Also, you must be very specific and stern with your server as they are fleeting and seem to think if you don't make a big deal about the little things they can put you off while tending to the other million tables they are waiting on. The menu at Sunda is deceiving, though it appears as though you can eat decently here for 30 dollars, that is clearly not the case. To enjoy your meal plan to spend 70-100 each.  For sushi in Chicago this is one of the places you have to go to, just mentally prepare yourself for suspect service.
