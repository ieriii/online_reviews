I have been to Tru twice. Once about six months ago and again more recently. And each time the food was nothing special.  The service has been great both times. This last visit, the sommelier was wonderful and selected a great bottle of wine within our price range. I really liked him. But the food is very upsetting. Now least you think I am some simpleton who has never experienced fine dinning. I have lived in New York and been to many of the most upscale places. I have lived in Europe and have been to many upscale restaurants in Paris and other countries.  I am not proud of this. I am not trying to boast . In fact, I do not like going to these types of restaurants. I only mention them to give some perspective. Quite simply, the food at Tru is nothing special. I expected much more. The list of ingredients sounds impressive. The plating looks elegant. But the taste is lackluster.  The desserts were equally uninspired. Save your money; we're in a recession.
