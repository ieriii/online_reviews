I consider myself to be nutritionally focused, value and take pride in what I eat. I also frequent various organic and health oriented restaurants quite often in the City of Chicago. This location was highly recommended by someone I know, but unfortunately my time there was not pleasant at all. Upon entering the restaurant we were approached in a way that was rather uncomfortable, however they thought the remark made was complimenting, but it wasn't. The server was not pleased with my pleasant rebuttal, so she continued to ignore me through out my entire time there. The cappuccino served was horrible, and the remake was even worse. The bus boy was more pleasant and attentive than the waitress. The chef was great. But I will not frequent this place again, nor recommend it to any of my FB friends, or business contingents. The food was delicious, but the service sucked. NaNa is a no go!
