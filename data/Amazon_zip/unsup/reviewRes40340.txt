Let me preface this by saying that we ate brunch here, so the review is only about that menu and not the dinner options. That being said, for a place that has just received a Michelin star, I expected much more out of my experience. We arrived a little before 11:00 and were seated right away - in between a bohemian pairing of women and a couple who were clearly there to pick apart everything they ate and eat enough to feed a small village. We ordered juice and cola and decided one of us would get lunch food and one breakfast, to span the gammut. I ordered the duck hash and got my egg scrambled (also a duck egg - never tasted the difference unless it is salt because MAN that egg was a sodium nightmare). Husband got a burger and thought it was okay, but nothing to rave about. He did, however, rave about the fries cooked in beef fat. The hash was good, but the weird vinagrette swirled on the side of the plate was just off-putting. It's brunch - eggs and hask and duck meat, fine, but mix in sour vinegar paste and NO thank you. It all just seemed like it was trying too hard. The orange juice was fresh squeezed and the service was fast (we were seated, ate and back in the car in 40 minutes) but I am not sure I would deal with the headache of parking in this permit only all the time neighborhood (we scored one of the VERY FEW metered spots on Kedzie) to wait forever for a dinner table. They need to grow up and take some reservations like any normal place if they mean to be serious about keeping that star.
