I don't even want to give it one star! Gross food- horrible service. I order thai here one night and the potstickers tasted like they had been sitting out all day (and felt like it too, cold and soggy) and the basil chicken smelled WRONG! When i called to complain they said all the could do was give me store credit- like I'd ever eat there again. DO NOT GO HERE- walk across the street to snow spice and try there wonderful basil chicken
