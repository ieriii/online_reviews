Being a tourist, I enjoyed my experience here. I went with a couple of friends (one works regularly in Chicago) and we had a great time. We started our evening of food and booze here and it provided a solid foundation. A bit pricey but the decor was nice and the staff was nicer. One downside - I sat facing the windows and the setting sun sat at just the right height to blast me in the face for awhile. I asked for the blinds to be lowered further, but they were as low as they would go. Time to get some better blinds.
