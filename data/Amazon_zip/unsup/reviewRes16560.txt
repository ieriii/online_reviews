I really used to like this place for its food, taste, style, decor , and overall fun. I was supremely disappointed last time I visited, however, in regards to the service. We had two servers for our party of 12, and I considered our party to be pretty low-maintenance and easy to please. No "princesses" here. So, as the two servers took the order for our party, my mother, whom was eating there for her first time and was still reading the menu, politely asked the female server to be "the last" order taken. The server quickly snapped back and very rudely said, "We took the orders. You ARE the last one." No smile, no jest in her voice. I thought either she was joking or I must have heard her wrong. Yet, we were all taken aback, as i could see in the faces of my dinner guests. Poor, poor behavior for a server, even if you are having a bad day. It was mid-afternoon also. Hardly the "end of the night." Not what I'd expect in a restaurant that pulls in as much money as this one. We should have complained, but we didn't want to dampen the mood and celebration. Plus, the other server for our table was more than polite. I give one star because there's absolutely no excuse for that kind of behavior from a server, especially since we did nothing to deserve it, and we spent quite a bit. We were an easy party and tipped a full 20% anyway since our other server was reliable and polite enough to deserve it. But now, this place leaves a nasty taste in my mouth. I won't be back soon.
