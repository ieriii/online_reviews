new oatmeal stout is amazing. We had a party of 8 and they found a way to accomodate us even though our full party was not there for quite awhile. Food was fantastic. Great hamburger with creamy gorgonzola and fried onion. Everyone else enjoyed the food as well. Love the selection of beer between there crafted brews and of course the guest beers they have as well. Great energy, fun place. 5 for beer, 4 for food but overall with the energy and friendliness they deserve a 5.
