Definitely not what I expected - large menu but not as expansive as Cheesecake Factory. Great service, great food, huge portions. Our waiter even brought me out for a free birthday dessert after noticing on my id that my birthday was in a few days. Be prepared to wait in the awkward waiting area with tons of tourists and families. But the wait is worth it...
