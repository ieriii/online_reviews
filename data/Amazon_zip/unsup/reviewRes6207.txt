My boyfriend and I went to Wildfire to celebrate a new job offer he received and the service was great! Food was prepared perfectly and everyone was very attentive although it was a busy night, I'm pretty sure it was a weekend day so that probably explains it. I loveeed the atmosphere. Our sitting arrangement was a little confined but once again, it was quite busy that night so its understandable :) I know this is so silly to comment on but I'm a carbs type of girl and their bread was DEEEEELISH! Its safe to say I had enough bread for like 2 lifetimes *teehee* A little too pricey for casual weekend outings which is why I rated it a 4 but its well worth it if you have the money :)
