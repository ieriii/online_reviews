Although I'm not new to the Korean BBQ experience, I was an SSGS virgin. Until recently.  Vegetarians beware. While you can find things on the menu to eat, the piles and piles of raw and cooked meat flowing around the table are not for the weak-hearted. There's also the smoke and smell from said cooking meat. Pass me a beer, kimchi, and some rice, please. SSGS serves up Korean BBQ like other places I've been. You order up something to grill at your table, then you're treated to a variety of condiments/side dishes, such as kimchi, to eat along with your meal. All of this is served family-style. While this experience is most enjoyable with a few others, it can be a bit crazy with larger groups (i.e. more than 10), so I'd recommend smaller groups.  Did I mention the kimchi? What really keeps me from giving more stars is the service. It takes far too long to flag someone down and get drinks or anything else needed at the table. I almost drank right out of the water pitcher on my last visit while waiting on a glass. If the smell of piles of tender meat cooked over an open flame, smoke from the grill, lots of Korean condiments, and drinks sounds like a good time, check out SSGS. Oh yeah, there's some tasty kimchi. I'll be back again just for that.
