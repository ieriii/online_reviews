The negative reviews for the Violet Hour are proof why some Chicagoans just don't "get it". Sometimes I WANT to go to a place that tries a little too hard and charges more for drinks because they take them as seriously as chefs do food. A cheap blues joint can't even be compared to this place. The Violet Hour is taken from the idea of Milk and Honey in London and NYC, and Chicago could use a place or two like that. It shows the city can do it all. A little something for everyone. I love that the minute you walk in, it feels like they are putting on a show for you. Like you're stepping into a play, a little escapism. Everyone that works there is putting on this show so that you have a good time. The blue Alice in Wonderland feel is perfect, the tall chairs let you have conversations with the person next to you while still hearing the music. And thank god for a place where people aren't loitering around the bar or clicking their lives away on their blackberries! You can actually focus on the lost art of face-to-face conversation!  Needless to say, the drinks are innovative. The snacks - helloooo, deviled eggs and peanut butter/banana sandwiches dipped in honey - are beyond yummy.  And if you go only a handful of times, get to know the doorman, and slip him an extra $20, that wait line becomes nonexistent.
