The cornmeal crust. We went here because we had to have a comparison between Gino's East and Lou Malnati's. Well Lou won hands down. I can't get used to the cornmeal crust, which was very filling and made me think I was having a pot pie. Like at Lou's a small was enough for 2 people. We also had an order of the chopped salad for some variety. The sauce was decent, but I can't get over the think and filling crust.
