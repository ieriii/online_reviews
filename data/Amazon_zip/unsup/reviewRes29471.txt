The #1 thing I miss about Chicago, by far!!! I have never had a bad experience here - the food is always amazing, especially the dessert! One word of caution to my fellow vegans (or those w/ dairy allergies)... If you're ordering something with non-dairy cheese, make sure you specify that you're vegan AND ask if the cheese has casein in it. I once ordered their lasagne with soy cheese, assuming it must be vegan, but got really sick. The next time I visited, I was told that the cheese I'd ordered previously contained casein. My bad for ASSUMING that soy cheese = dairy-free!
