Food is good, concepts are great, hostesses are terrible. The real question here is whether or not the food is worth the hour and a half wait. I'm still debating.  The brioche french toast was the most noteworthy item. It's a sweet dish worth ordering even if you typecast yourself as a savory kind of brunch-goer. All in all, the best part of my brunch experience was our burly beard-faced waiter. I would have happily traded my meal and 1.5 hour wait-time for a big bear hug from Paul Bunyan.
