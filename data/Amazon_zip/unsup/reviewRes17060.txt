Simply amazing...and a bit easier to get to for me if I don't feel like traveling all the way to Devon Street. I was lucky enough to come with 4 dinner companions, one whom had the hook up. So glad too because the menu is so intimidating...I took one glance at it, and my stomach not only growled but it lurched in my stomach. It was screaming at my brain bc I had just finished a work out and it only wanted me to feed it...not try to decipher a 3000 dish menu. I hate to say it...this review may be useless since I let someone else order for the table...I had no idea what I was eating. Here's how my experience broke down though. Starters: Naan with tomato cream dip - Delicious. Gone in about 5 minutes. Fried Veggies Appetizer - Similar to tempura...so good. Loved the fried spinach balls. Some chicken and onion appetizer - Never had it before. Awesome, and I kept picking at the onions. Some chicken on a heated plate served over onions - Juicy. Great, even though I usually don't eat chicken. Entrees: Fish Tikka Masala - Didn't get a chance to try. Chicken Tikka Masala - Amazing. Delicious. Scrumptious. I have nothing else to say. Lamb dish on a heated plate - I didn't get to try bc the boys in my group ate it all first. Mutter Paneer - Best I've had in the city. Seriously. I want more!!! Rita - Loved it. 2 types of Naan Poppadom Rice - Yum. There wasn't enough...I was sad all the white people took my rice. 3 bottles of red wine. Fantastic service. Lovely atmosphere. I glanced at the bill when it came...around $250-90ish without tip for 5 people - 3 boys, 2 girls...and absolutely nothing left over. I think that was mostly bc we all ate and drank like it was our last meal on earth. I want go back. Now. Also, I noticed lots of Desi's were there....I give India House my vote with confidence. As for their lunch buffet, if they have it on the weekends, I want to go. I mean, I can't do it on the weekdays...I'd for sure fall asleep at my desk.
