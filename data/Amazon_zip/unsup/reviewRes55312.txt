I liked this place ok. Compared to NYC brazillian steakhouses that I've been to it's not number one on my list. Service is great, the only gripe that I had was that I was wearing a white shirt, and when they sliced the meat a bunch of its juices got on my white shirt. Nothing was done about it. So I would say, be careful if you're wearing something nice.
