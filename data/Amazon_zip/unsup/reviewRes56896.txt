I've been to Piece three times. The one time in the mid afternoon was best. But the other two visits were marred rather drastically. The pizza is good, but not amazing. The beer is good. And I like to support local. But with all of the amazing craft beer available it's not worth going out of your way to get. But the real killer is the noise. And especially the music. We asked 3 staff at different points to turn it down. And it would come down for 2-3 minutes. Then be cranked back up to ear splitting. It really is pointless to go here with anyone. You have to yell to be heard. My wife was horse by the time we left. My friend said the trumpet was so loud he would rather die than have the audio assault continue. I'm glad for them that they are popular. But the people waiting for a table really just wind up standing in the aisles packed in like sardines. Even the cramped nature of Uno's or Duo's downtown provide a significantly better dining experience. I really don't plan to go back to Piece.
