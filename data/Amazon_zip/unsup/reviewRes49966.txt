Wow, this place is good. I came on a recommendation of a friend, and it did not disappoint. I went on a Friday night with my bf and another couple. We got there right at 7pm and were told it was a 20 minute wait. That was pretty accurate.  We started off with an order of the empanada sampler. It was 6 empanadas and that was a good start for the four of us. Most of us also got a mojito and it was very good. Not too much rum to take away the flavor of the mint, but enough that you could taste it there. For dinner, the two guys got the skirt steak. Now, my bf is a really picky eater, and he is hard to impress. But he LOVED his meal and couldn't stop talking about it. The portion is huge and he finished every bite of the steak. My friend got one of the combination plates with the steak and the pork, and she was very pleased as well. I got a combination plate with calamari and shrimp. Both were very good. The shrimp was excellent and full of flavor, and the calamari was cooked perfectly and not chewy at all. If you are going to go, I think the combination plate is the right choice because then you get to try two things, and it doesn't seem like the skimp down on the portions of what they give you. Afterwards, we were stuffed. We were debating trying the flan, but decided we were too full. Our waiter had heard us trying to figure that out, and he brought us an order of flan on the house. What a perfect way to end the evening! A note on service: I was a bit hesitant after reading other people's reviews on here, but I was VERY pleased with the service. Our waiter was awesome and even gave us each recommendations on how to enjoy our leftovers at home.  I don't have a negative thing to say about this place and will for sure be going back... especially on a weekday to take advantage of the BYOB.
