Big Jones provides a superlative dining experience. The cocktails are "spot on", the staff is attentive, young, and hip, and the food is delicious and healthy - suprising for Southern food. I have to say that I don't necessarily love the South, but I love Big Jones - a little bit of Alice Waters influenced to be sure... NorCal southern with a great cocktail and wine list that compliments the culinary adventures available. I especially love their brunch.P.S. Que C is trippin! He doesn't know shit from apple butter!
