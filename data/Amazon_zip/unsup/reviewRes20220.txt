i had heard great things about this restaurant from a co-worker and later saw it highly rated in Food & Wine so when my old schoolmates were in town for the National Restaurant Show, we gave it a try. The Blush Martini tastes wonderful and comes with tons of bubbles and fresh berries. I got the "Regular" Burger while my friend got "The Gage" Burger. I tried both and both tasted great, however, when it comes to burgers I have a more simplistic taste and didn't feel "The Gage" was worth $6 more than the "Regular" which was priced very reasonably for the menu. My other friend got the Semolina Dumplings - which she raved about. So the food and drinks were great. The service, not so much. Let me start by saying that all three of us are in the service industry and have high expectations. The menu at The Gage does not have the most common plates in general. We first had a discussion about what Semolina actually is and figured it out between us. Out of curiosity, we then asked our server, sort of as a "test". She failed miserably. While we were visiting (we hadn't seen each other in nearly a year!) she kept on asking if she could take our plates away when we were clearly not finished. This was highly irratating. I give this restaurant 5 stars for food and drinks but they need to order staff that take an interest in their product and guests.
