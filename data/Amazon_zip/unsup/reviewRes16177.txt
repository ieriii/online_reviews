Apparently, the Violet Hour is where the beautiful go to hang out. And the not so beautiful people, who look look beautiful here due to all the flickering lights. Their cocktails are divine, from scratch liquid masterpieces. And the apps are good, really good. I always start my reviews with a solid 3 stars and either go up or down as warranted. Unfortunately, we can only go up to 5 with the Violet Hour, because it is definitely better than as good as it gets.  Go, have fun, drink a delicious drink, and feel beautiful.
