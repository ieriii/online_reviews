We went with our kids for what was supposed to be amazing chicken. We were not so impressed. The chicken had a lot of breading but was a bit over cooked for our taste. We got just the fried chicken and not any of the other specialty types as our little boy can be picky. (no sauces). We wish we might have tried one of those as it may have added some more flavor. I suppose we were most disappointed in our plate of chicken because there was very little meat on the bones. I was mainly the breading and not much meat at all. The drink options are pretty limited other than bottles of various predictable brands. Overall it was an ok experience. We might return to try out one of the other versions as others around us seemed to be enjoying them but I can't say this joint has lived up to the hype we have heard about it so far. This is also mainly a take out place. There are a few picnic type tables to sit at but there is not much space.
