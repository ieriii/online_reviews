A very nice Italian restaurant with great good. For an appetizer, my date and I shared the hummus. Too much olive oil and tomatoes for our taste...the hummus was green! My entree was the Ziti al Vodka. To die for. Took some home and actually ate some the next day (I typically hate leftovers). However, our service wasn't that great. Everything took way too long. From waiting to order our food to waiting for the check, it was too long, especially considering that it wasn't busy at all.
