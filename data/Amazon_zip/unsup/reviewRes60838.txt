Went there last Friday for dinner and everything was great! Sammy set us up with some wine & cheese pairing in the wine room and that was excellent. After that, we were escort to our table for dinner. Dinner was great with variety of salads, meats, and fish. Very good service from all the staff. The GM came over to make sure we were having a great dinner. Will definitely come back soon!
