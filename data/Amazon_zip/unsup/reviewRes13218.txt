This review is being written in real time. When you tell people it's a 20-25 minute wait, mean it. I, and many others, are pissed after waiting much longer while a large table sits unused. Terrible planning. Plus, apparently their waitstaff can't turn tables fast enough, but isn't communicating that to the hostess station. Again, terrible planning. After a week of bad service everywhere from The Gage to Papa John's, I've had it. What's the deal? Have restaurants decided service isn't important anymore? However, they do have great food and wonderful beers. So if you're willing to put up with a wait and bad service, go for it. I will try it again, but if I have the same experience, we're done.
