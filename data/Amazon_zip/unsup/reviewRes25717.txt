Took my girlfriend here for an anniversary dinner and enjoyed our experience -- would give this a 3.5 if possible. The prices weren't bad, the wait staff & owner were really kind, and, best of all, it's BYOB so we brought a nice bottle of wine to split. Had seen a review on Yelp! that praised the Saigonese Crepe as an appetizer and were really happy we listened. The Crepe was the best part of the meal and big enough for both of us to get a good amount.
