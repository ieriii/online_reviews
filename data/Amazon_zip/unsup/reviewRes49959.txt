Really enjoyed taking my boyfriend here for his birthday. Went on a Sunday, no wait. The service from start to finish was excellent, everyone is friendly and attentive. Started out with great drinks, pineapple mojito and some muddled drink that the bf loved. We both tried the skirt steak platter with shrimp and chicken, respectively. Oh, and can't forget about the empanadas, yummm and a great way to start the meal. I tend to like more sauce on my food, but that's just me, they served a few different toppings (chimichurri?) for the meat which was good, I just would have liked something for my yuca. Overall, would def go back.
