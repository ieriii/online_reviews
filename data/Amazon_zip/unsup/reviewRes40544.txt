Carne Asada tacos are amazing. All you need is a little cilantro, onion and some green sauce (optional), and you have one of the best tacos in the city. The Carne Asada is really well spiced, flavorful and best of all, almost always freshly grilled. This last point makes all the difference between a standard taqueria taco and La Pasadita's Carne Asada. Enjoy.
