India House is home to the best Indian Cuisine in Chicago. It's also home to the best lunch buffet in the city. Every dish here is excellent, from the tomato soup to chicken and lamb dishes, to the mango ice cream. It's a little on the expensive side, but WELL worth it. Take your co-workers here for a special lunch occasion, you won't be sorry.
