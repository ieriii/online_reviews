This restaurant is somewhere that every steak lover needs to go! But, even for the people out their who do not like steak, they are great fish and the calamari is amazing! The steak is the best thing on the menu and the best steak I have ever had. It is so tender and it is always cooked perfect. I ate so much when I went that I could not eat for 3 days after! Also, the dessert menu is exceptional and one dessert is big enough to share between 3 people! It is also a family restaurant that you can bring everyone to as well as a casual restaurant if you want it to be. This is a restaurant that will never disappoint your expectations.
