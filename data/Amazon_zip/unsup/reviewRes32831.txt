The first time I was here....The Sushi was excellent....Second time I went the sushi was just okay....I went with a group of friends....Some of them came for the first time....and was a huge disappointment on the uni nigiri....My friend was not a person that would complain...but somehow he did....The manager comped all of our 7 orders of uni nigiri....The manager was very nice....and even had the sushi chief came over....I feel like we are being treated like a value customer.....I think customers are always right.....I am going back to this place Sunday....I hope the uni are good this time =)....Thanks a lot Sunda!!!....I'm still in love with this place.
