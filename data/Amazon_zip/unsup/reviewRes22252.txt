After reading the reviews and being told that I would enjoy the food here.. I was actually a little disappointed. When looking at the pictures online the HOTPOT looked amazingly delicious, however again I was quite disappointed. It was a lot of work, really messy.. and they also provided sauces on the side. However i didnt really like the sauces. I also ordered 2 different dishes to go, it was chili and beef and chili with chicken. The beef dish was basically in oil. The chicken was actually kind of like general tos chicken (without the sauce) with a ton of dried chilies that werent even hot. Over all, like I said its ok. It probably wont be my first choice to go to again if I went down there, but I probably would go back just to try the different dishes. Also, we had to wait about 30mins or longer to get into the restaurant because it was just so busy. However when we told them that we wanted to eat the Hotpot.. they brought it out pretty quickly. A few mins later, they brought out my 2 dishes to go.
