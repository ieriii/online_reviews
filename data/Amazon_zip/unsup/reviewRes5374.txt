I've only been here once, but it's a place that I plan to return many more times. I'll say this though, I went on an early lunch in order to get fast seating and service. I have not experienced the evenings there and I'm not sure if I want to. Now for the dishes. For starters, my friend and I had marinated, fried olives stuffed with sausage. AMAZING! I like olives a lot, and the quality of these were great, especially with the sausage in there. We also had the chicken kebabs with fried mashed potatoes. The chicken was good, not the best, but did help with the sauce on it. The potatoes were really good. The best part about what we had though was the pork blade steak with honey sauce. The pork was vvvvvvery tasty, but then to make it better was the tenderness of it. So tender I could barely tell there where the fat was. Only place I've been where the pork is more tender is Longman and Eagle. Oh, I should say that the honey sauce did top it off, making it one of the best lunches I have had in a while. Service was pretty good there, didn't take too long for the food. I didn't check out the wine or beer selections at all because it was lunch, but I've heard from others they're good. Even without the drinks, I'd say check it out. Good veggie food from what I hear too!
