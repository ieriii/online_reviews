A regular spot for my girlfriend and myself. The beer list is large and of quality. The draft list always has solid beers on it, but not hard to find releases. Burgers and fries are their specialty. Their pork belly is superb (The Belly Burger or the Pork Belly sandwich are a must). I like the fact you can get creole seasoning on your fries as well. Perfect for a Saturday lunch or weeknight drink and burger.
