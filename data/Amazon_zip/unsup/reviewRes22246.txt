This has been my go-to Greek restaurant for years. Never a bad experience. Definately expect a wait on weekends and even on some weeknights. The bar is not a bad place to wait (if there's room). Some favorites of mine include taramasalata, the chicken pie wrapped in phylo (look for it on the specials), and broiled fish.  The wait staff are almost all older and male. Sometimes they come off as a bit gruff but professionalism rules the day here.
