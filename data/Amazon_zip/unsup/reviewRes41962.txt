I just want to find a good pho place who doesnt pump broth full of msg or some bullion ( you can find these in jars at the local orient grocer - made of beef fat and concentrate). If you have ever had home made pho, been to vietnam, or lived in the west coast its a bit over priced and quality ok. why do I come back? cause I have no where to go.. I need to find a place with real broth ( though I know this is a semi-home made version) I want the real stuff. And they dont have imperial rolls (served in fried rice paper skin versus the regular stuff)
