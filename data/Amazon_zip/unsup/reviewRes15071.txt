Went here for the first time and had an incredible meal. The Sweet Potato cakes are excellent with complex flavors of roasted peppers and a touch of curry, the Apple pork pizza was delicious, as was the bread pudding dessert. The beer list is extensive, but get something that is brewed in house, they have great beers in great variety. Finally the place is lively without feeling cramped or crowded, the service was attentive, helpful and not pushed, and the meal was incredible. Enjoy!
