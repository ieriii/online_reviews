Little Bucharest Bistro was basically the opposite of what I was expecting. I tend to love grungy hole-in-the-wall restaurants from the former soviet world with boiled food, sparse vegetarian options, dirty silverware, grumpy waitresses in stained uniforms, and grandma cooking in the back. Having passed this place driving up Elston a million times, I thought that I was in for my usual post-soviet experience. But I was wrong! This is in fact (an attempt at an) upscale Romanian bistro. Fancy peasant food? OK, I will try anything once. We had a very tasty and smooth soft polenta appetizer that I feel should have been served with more feta to balance out the creme fraiche. My vegetarian "goulas" was actually an eggplant strata served over cous cous-- no paprika, definitely not boiled, tasty as hell (though a big too oily). Grandma did not prepare this meal. The charismatic and clearly eccentric owner asked my date if his chicken dish was "big enough." I think it was. Next time-- limo service.
