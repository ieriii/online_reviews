Best churro I ever ate. Had it with the thick mexican drinking chocolate and used it to dip. Pork Belly Vermicelli Caldo was awesome too. Pork belly fried to a delectable crisp. Soup was flavorful with a slight spice to it. Something I never really had before and it was pretty amazing. I wish I lived in Chicago so I could eat here on a regular basis and try all the other things they have.
