90 miles cuban was an extremely pleasant surprise. typically, when i go for cuban, i expect somewhat dry plantains, dry chicken, clumped up rice. the chicken was so tender. the beans and rice were flavored delicately and cooked perfectly. i really liked this joint. i went with a group of 6 and it was a fun laid back atmosphere... only downside was that it was a little loud and hard to hear conversation with that many people because our voices plus the distance across the table competed with the fabulous music they were playing. BYO was a major plus... i went when it was cold, but i heard they have a pretty sweet patio.
