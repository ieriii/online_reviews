Meh is how I feel about this restaurant. I live around the corner from here and it took about six months for me to be able to get in. (They don't take reservations.) Small annoyance, but whatever. I had been hearing so many good things about this place so I was super excited when I was finally able to get in. Sadly, I feel like it didn't really live up to all the hype. The food was good, but I've had better, and the server was kind of arrogant. Not what I was hoping for. Oh well.
