i would first like to apologize to caro mio for lessening their cozy, romantic atmosphere with our bachelorette party the other week. a big thanks to the staff for ignoring the "blow job bib" our lucky bride-to-be was wearing, and a special thanks to our sexy waiter for entertaining (if not accomodating) my request for body shots off of him. all that aside (hey, it's byob- don't judge), the food here is Amazing. i will go so far as to say that this might be as good or better than la gondola! from the lobster ravioli to the ricotta-stuffed spinach gnocchi in gorgonzola cream sauce, the pasta here is drool on yourself good. all that, and close to my hood? hell yes. i'll be back soon!
