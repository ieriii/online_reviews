Garcia's is my favorite Mexican joints north of North Ave. I only say that because my favorite Mexican joint south of North Ave is La Pasadita. The salsa @ Garcia's is excellent. I've only gotten the tacos and burritos there. The steak tastes like steak. The chorizo tastes like chorizo. It's awesomely great cheap Mexican food. If I still lived in the area, I'd be going there at least once avery 2 weeks (hey, I'm trying to watch my figure....)
