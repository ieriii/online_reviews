Unlike so many other pizza joints in Chicago, Piece was a refreshing pizza experience. If you are indecisive this place is not for you! It was a little hard for me to come up with pizza topping combos since they don't have ones you can select from--but we ended trying one red and one white with a few toppings each--nothing crazy (although there were some crazy toppings!). The pizza was nice and thin and delicious. Great service and helpful staff too!
