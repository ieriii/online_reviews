Food Snobs can go ahead and rip this place but the fact of the matter is Grand Lux provides generous portions of fine dining quality food(a notch below fine dining) in a solid presentation, with great flavor. Avoid PIZZA and pasta here, and you will be quite pleased. I believe Grand Lux's menu, while similiar for sure, is a bit better than sister Cheesecake Factory.
