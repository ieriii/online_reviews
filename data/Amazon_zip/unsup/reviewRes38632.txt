An initial visit visit to Chicago is not complete until you try a Giordano's deep dish pizza. This establishment was my first introduction to the Chicago Pizza "pie" culinary experience. Although the service is mediocre at best, your not going there for the wait staff. One thing to note however is the wait time for the pizza to be made. Expect a 35-45min wait for your pizza to arrive on your table. Not a place to go for a uncomfortable blind date.
