After eating here for the first time I actually said "My tummy is smiling right now." I left this place feeling so satisfied and full of yummy pho and avocado cream cheese wantons, that I just wanted to curl up in a fetal position and grin. Don't want to take the El to a trash and urine filled part of town to eat good pho? No problem, just stay in Lincoln Park. This place is sure to satisfy your pho cravings. It rivals the best of what Argyle has to offer. It is clean, cheap, tasty, and the service is awesome. Did I mention they deliver! Why go anywhere else? Oh and its BYOBoooyaaa.
