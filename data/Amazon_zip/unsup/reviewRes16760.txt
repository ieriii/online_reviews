My eyes lit up when I walked into this restaurant and saw the buffet. It was everything I would have wanted to order but in all-you-can-eat format. Glorious. Moreover, at most buffets, the food quality is the first thing that suffers but this wasn't the case at India House. Everything was delicious and the tandoori chicken (which is brought fresh to your table, even with the buffet) was actually delicious, flavorful, and juicy -- and I normally detest tandoori chicken! Also, the mango ice cream is a must-try. I do wish that the naan was a little softer and less crispy but it was really not a huge issue at all. If you like Indian food, definitely give this place a shot.
