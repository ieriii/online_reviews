The pizza was decent. Toppings were obviously good quality even if the crust seemed a little bland/soft. My delivery experience, on the other hand, was AWFUL. I ordered through grubhub, which gave me a delivery estimate time of 60 minutes (both initiallly and in the order confirmation email). My pizzas took an hour and 40 (!) minutes to arrive. And (unsurprisingly, after all that time), the pizzas were lukewarm when they finally arrived. One of them actually had the top of the pizza box crushed into the pizza as well. (I'm pretty sure the boxes weren't made to hold up to the humidity of a cooling pizza for as long as it took for them to get to me.) While I was waiting I went to their website and noticed that since I live one block north of Montrose, I'm actually one block outside their official delivery area. They must have expanded it for Grubhub, which my experience suggests was a poor decision since the pizza I received DEFINITELY did not survive the trip well.
