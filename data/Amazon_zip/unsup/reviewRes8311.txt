I just love this place, plain and simple. K and I have been going to Spacca since we moved into the 'hood, which was right around the time when they opened. I think we've had just about everything on the menu by now. And then some. I went to Spacca over the wknd with two other couples, one couple had NEVER been there before! One of the newbies asked how big the pizzas were. I simply said "lunch size," since the pizzas remind me of what I'd have for lunch every day while I was in Rome. This time, we tried four different ones - the buffalo mozz and arugula, the sausage and mushroom, the diavola (FINALLY a permanent pie on the menu! I remember when it used to be just a special!), and the three tomato special. All were just as delish as ever! The buffalo mozz is, IMHO, the perfect cheese for these pizzas. Yes, it can leave the middle a little on the soggy side, but I don't mind, not one bit. One other thing I love about Spacca - they serve Menabrea! Only a few spots in the City serve this Italian brew, and, thanks to Spacca, I love it with pizza. It was nice to see that Spacca FINALLY expanded into the space just west of them. And yes, there's still a wait. But it's totally worth it in my book!
