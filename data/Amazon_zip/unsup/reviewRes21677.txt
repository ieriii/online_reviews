I think you pretty much get your money's worth here. The staff is very friendly and prompt, and the food was pretty good, too. I had a very delicious tortilla soup, and a steak burrito which was on par with other authentic Mexican places. It was very loud and rowdy when I was there, though, and I was disappointed in their complimentary tortilla chips and salsa. I would say this place is more like 3 and 1/2 stars, but since Yelp won't let you do that, I'd rather round down than up in general.
