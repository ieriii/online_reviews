I thought this place was OK. I went here with another couple and between the 4 of us, we split 2 appetizers and 4 entrees which was a good amount of food. Everything we ordered sounded SOO good, but tasting each food, I wasn't overly thrilled. Appetizers we ordered: Avocado Wontons - Sounded amazing because I love both avocado and cream cheese. The sauce was really good, however the way it was prepared didn't do the dish any justice. The cream cheese was on one side and the avocado was on the other, so you didn't really get the full effect. It was good, but I think could have been a LOT better. Chicken Dumplings: Good, can't go wrong with dumplings in my opinion. Entrees: Pineapple Calamari - Preparation was really pretty - it was all served in a half pineapple, however the calamari was super chewy in my opinion and I expected better flavors out of it.  Bamboo Roasted Duck - It was OK, the flavor didn't really leave an impression on me.  Grilled Salmon Noodles - Flavor was really good. It came with a delicious ginger garlic sauce - tangy and delicious! Simply It Chicken Fried Rice - My friend remembered it being really good, but I wasn't overly impressed. I liked it, but didn't leave any kind of lasting impression on me. Overall, I had a great time here. The BYOB is really nice with no corkage fee and the food is good. I can't say I would be dying to go back though since I tried quite a bit of what is on the menu and wasn't really wow-ed.
