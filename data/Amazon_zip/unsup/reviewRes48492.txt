I was so excited to come here since I love meat (especially pork) but it didn't live up to the hype. To be honest, I was starting to come down with a cold and I was so full from all the food I had eaten over the weekend but the meal was average. We had the sweetbreads and the bollito misto (the pork shoulder was great, sausage was ok). They were both good but didn't overly excite me. I would definitely go back but I would try the pork shoulder, the ribs, and the mixed ham plate. The beers were great (nice to see The Bruery on there which is a local SoCal brewery).
