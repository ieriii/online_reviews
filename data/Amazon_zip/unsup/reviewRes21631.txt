All I need to say is, simply the most unique Mexican I've ever had. The Caldos Carnitas had quite a kick. It was so delicious I wanted to get back in line and grad seconds, but instead opted to go to the Frontera Grill for drinks and dessert. The Guac rocked as an app, but I preferred the salsa verde. Tasted like it was made fresh in Mexico.
