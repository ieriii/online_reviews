I've typically loved Sultan's but man their delivery SUCKS! I've gotten a couple of times and every time they mess it up. It's either they get the order wrong, the food sucks, or they take forever. I'd stick to going there, and stay away from getting it at home. I mean if you can't do good delivery then don't offer it.
