um, i don't get it? we came here to celebrate 2 years of dating back in september and nothing about the experience stands out. i don't get what all the hype is about. we ate outside on the second floor balcony which was nice but REALLY crowded...not really conducive to romance. food was fine...service was fine. none of it seemed worth the price. would not go back.
