Seems a little funny that a place that's supposed to resemble a speakeasy (whether on purpose or not) has almost 800 reviews.... just sayin'. Not so secret and you are not special for knowing about it you pretentious f*ck. Came here once not really interested in coming back. The experience was OK but not worth the pretentious attitude, long lines, and ridiculous prices. I will say the decor is something you must check out at least once... but once is probably enough.  Oh and the drinks are gross.. I tasted at least 6 or 7 of them and I don't give a rats ass if there is a raw egg in it or not it tastes like garbage liquid....  Yeah, that liquid that builds up in the bottom of the garbage bag.. kinda assuming it would be the same flavor.
