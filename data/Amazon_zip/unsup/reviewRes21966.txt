I tried this place after seeing a lot of great reviews... I wasn't too impressed. I can say that the margaritas are to DIE for. OMG. I would be fine coming here and just having drinks. The food was alright. Typical Mexican food, nothing to push it over the edge to being extraordinary. I love refried beans... but theirs really weren't good. I am sure I will be back on a tuesday or thursday for the half price drinks and will try something different. Maybe I will find the magical menu item that is to so amazing. The dining room is small and it gets very loud. We went on a Friday night, so it was very busy. Service was no more than what should be expected... Food came out fast.
