I want to start by saying that the Oatmeal Shake made with soymilk was one of the most delicious things I can think of. So, so good. I've been waiting a long time to eat here. We're on the faaaaar north side, so whenever I make it to the Wicker Park area, I always end up eating at Sultans, Handlebar or even Ear Wax with meat eating friends. Irazu is a great addition to the plethora of great vegan options in the area. The outdoor eating area is great. I saw kids and dogs and dates and it was a great atmosphere. The service was strange. Super friendly, but very slow, forgetful and maybe a little overwhelmed. Forgot our appetizer, brought spinach and cheese empanadas out to my brother who is terrified of all green things. It turned out, though, that according to my bf those were the most delicious things at the table. My brother killed his replacement empanadas, my bf liked his tacos. I was disappointed with the vegan burrito I got - I love hot stuff, but the hot peppers didn't really mix well with the mushrooms and spinach I ordered with my burrito. The tostones with garlic olive oil were great.
