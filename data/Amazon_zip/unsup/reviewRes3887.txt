Crisp rocks. We had the wings and the Chi-Town Chicken Bowl. Both portions were quite generous and we took home leftovers. For $2 more, you can add fries and a soda to your wings order. (But no soda fountain, bummer.) Their sauce is delicious -- sweet, spicy and tangy. The actual restaurant is small and fills up pretty quickly. I definitely recommend dining at an off-time or skipping that for delivery.
