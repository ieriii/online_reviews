I went for brunch and was extremely delighted. The food was delicious and very inexpensive for the quality. However the part the left the greatest impression on me (well, tied with the food) was the service, which, was excellent. The waitress was super nice and the chefs funny and nice. My girlfriend couldn't eat the yogurt in the yogurt and granola but ordered the granola anyway so they made this beautiful work of art out of fruit for her. Very nice and extremely friendly. I can not wait to go back.
