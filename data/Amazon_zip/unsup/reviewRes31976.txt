Great food and fast service despite the place being absolutely packed this past Saturday night. They were turning walk-ins away left and right. Would have been five stars but they should warn of bones in some of the meat... I went after a piece of lamb that I thought was all meat with fervor and a sharp piece of bone almost went through my cheek. With a chicken drumstick and other things like that it's obvious, but with some pieces not so much.
