This place is almost perfect. The food is delicious, cheap and healthy, the atmosphere is very pleasant, and I don't mind paying cash. The service is somewhat less than awesome. You tell the guy in the kitchen area what you want, then after he makes it, you pay. Unfortunately, sometimes it takes him a really long time to make it, and you stand up there awkwardly for a while. Once I sat back down at my table right by the kitchen area, and the guy assumed I'd left, even though my friends and I were literally the only people in the restaurant. A little potential awkwardness is, in my opinion, not a deterrent when chickpeas are involved.
