Wow! This Place is off the charts good... I left off a star beacause after waitng in line for 25 minutes we see a sign that says "CASH ONLY" so I had to leave hit an ATM and go back and wait... But the Bell Pepper and chicken dog was unreal, we ordered a few different ones Duck and Prime rib... worht the two 25 minute linesThis place is genius! ***BRING CASH... EXPECT A LINE, GIVE YOURSELF SOME TIME****
