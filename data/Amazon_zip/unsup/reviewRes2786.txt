Tru is modern elegance personified. High ceilings, great art, inventive cuisine and an impeccable wine list all add to the experience that is Tru. The Sashimi appetizer was a table favorite, as were the scallops with avocado dumplings and the cheese selection---brought to your table on a cart and presented and explained by the resident cheese expert (though we thought at $20 a person the three cheese selection was over priced). With two sommeliers on the floor, all wine quandaries are easily answered and attended to. Overall, we can't say enough good things about the dining experience we had at Tru. The crowd was also surprisingly eclectic ranging from museum/artist types to captains of industry to stylish urbanites. **Diners that catch a chill at Tru are offered a Pashmina in the color of their choice out of a box that one might mistake for a cigar box. Pashminas are returned at the end of the meal.
