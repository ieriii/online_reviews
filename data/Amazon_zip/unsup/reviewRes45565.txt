We ate here for a friends B day and had a great time. The food was spectacular (I thought it would be typical irish food). The service was fantastic. It's nice to see that somebosy actually cares about how nice the inside of their bar looks. Very impressed! I do have to say that the music was a bit odd at times tho... I didn't check to see if it was on a juke.
