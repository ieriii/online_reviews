Fabulous Italian fare, huuge portions & cozy little vibe. First off, the Open Table reservation was super helpful, I highly recommend it on any peak night since the restaurant is on the cozier side and there isn't a whole ton of space to wait. Except by the bar which obviously is no twist of the arm for me... My second time here and we sat upstairs which was also very nice, I kind of liked it better because it was more roomy. Our waitress was very sweet and made recommendations since we had some Mia Virgins at the table. Ordered the house red pinot which was good about $45 a bottle. They are notorious for their mussels app but I couldn't resist an authentic caprese salad. They use buffalo mozzarella instead of regular cow's milk which I thought was pretty nifty. I decided to take the road less traveled this time and order a pizza as my entree (yup, ALL for me, so selfish I know). This pizza had olives, prosciutto, artichoke, cheese, and a fried egg on top. OH BABY. When it comes out they do a fun little "pizza dance" if you will where they dice the egg up for you which my friend's boyfriend found mesmerizing. While very delicious it started to get soggy towards the end. I would still highly recommend trying it out, I had no idea they were infamous for pizza as well as pasta/seafood entrees. My friends tried the gnocchi and seemed to really enjoy , I stole a few bites from their dishes as well and thought the gnocchi filling was very rich but not overbearing. Since it was my friends birthday they were nice to bring out a cream puff contraption with vanilla ice cream. Thanks :) Overall: authentic Italian cuisine at very modest prices with awesome vibes (did I mention they had a playlist that contained MJ & The Roots?) MAGNIFICO!
