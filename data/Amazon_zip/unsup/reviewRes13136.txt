The human body is not conditioned nor designed to digest the amount of butter I put into myself last night. What's a guy to do when he has bottomless Alaskan king crab served to him all night? Life is tough. A helluva loss leader if you ask me. I definitely got my money's worth. ...oh right, the crab legs were amazing. Best you'll find in the city and I've been to all the highfalutin seafood joints around here. Got there right around 6 after work, waited 5 minutes for them to set up a table for two of us and we were off to the races. DO WORK, SON.
