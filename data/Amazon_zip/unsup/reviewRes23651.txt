Let me start out by saying that the food alone is definitely worth 5 stars, so if it is just food that you're looking for, then go and enjoy a unique and exceptional meal there. Where I dock them an entire star for is their service.  My table began by ordering crab rangoon (yes, I know, it is one of the Americanized foods there, but that doesn't make it any less delicious) and it very well might have been the best crab rangoon I've ever had. For the main course we decided to get adventurous and order a hot pot. Having never had anything like it before, when the waitress threw down a plate of raw meat and a boiling kettle of God knows what in front of us, we were thoroughly confused about what to do. After sitting there for a minute simply staring at the plate of raw seafood, with it's side dish of raw beef and lamb we decided to ask some fellow restaurant goers how you go about attacking such an intimidating dish. After help from some very nice people we figured it out, and the meal itself was fantastic. I think the hot pot was one of the most unique dining experiences of my life, and I highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for something different out of their Chinese food experience. Overall the food was so good that it almost made us forget that we had a plate of raw meat thrown in front of us with no explanation, but I did have to knock them a star for it.
