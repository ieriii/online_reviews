It took me nearly four years of living in Chicago to discover one of it's finest offerings in pizza. Forget gino's easy or giodarnos. Pequod's is the best deep dish I've had so far and it's even worth the nearly two hour wait for delivery. I loved the pepperoni and the sausage pizzas I've had from here. In case you're wondering they do deliver downtown so pick up your phone and place an order next time you want a good, not-so-healthy Chicago treat.
