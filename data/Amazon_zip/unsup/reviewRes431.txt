My boyfriend took me here for my last birthday and it was the best gift ever! Since I've moved to Chicago I've become somewhat of a hardcore foodie (as much as a grad student's salary allows--a lot of restaurant week outings), and a friend of mine had been raving about Alinea. The food was amazing, as you can tell from the other reviews. We had the 12 course menu. The experience was incredible--every dish had its own story and way of eating it, it was the most fun grown-up experience I've ever had. My boyfriend is also a vegetarian, and they made all the same dishes with vegetarian alternatives--he loved it as well. In all my experiences with vegetarian tasting menus, it almost seems like the ones that start out all vegetarian aren't as good as the ones where the meat/fish part is subbed out. Now I think of the worth of things in terms of Alinea dinners. Like, should I go away for Thanksgiving, or save that plane ticket for a dinner at Alinea? You can guess the ending. I would highly recommend this for a special occasion. You'll have to save up for awhile, but it's totally worth it!
