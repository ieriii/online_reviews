Second time to Bad Apple and both visits were very good. Go for the burger, any burger and don't mess around with the other stuff. I've tried the Slow Burn burger, onions cooked with a dark ale, bacon and cooked jalepenos, cheese. Great. Last night I split the Edmond Fig-gerald, not much sweetness from the fig, but good with the goat cheese. I also tried the Belly Burger, pork belly, horseradish sauce on a prezel bun - very good as well, but not much of a kick from the horseradish sauce. Four things I really like about this place: 1) Nice tap beer menu, and tons more in bottles, at great prices. My Great Lakes Dortmunder Lager was $4 a pint. Very fair. 2) Food is cooked properly and decent presentation. A medium burger comes to the table pink enough on the inside, every time. 3) Service is among the best I've ever had, anywhere. And this is really a burger and beer joint. A 1/4 glass left of beer? They ask if I'd like another and bring it within seconds. 4) Finally, what I really like about the Bad Apple is the vibe. it's loud, crowded and so on by 6:30pm, but no one is stressing - not the staff, not the patrons. Customers both times offed to make room at the bar for us. Didn't have to. They just did. That's very cool. Good on ya, Bad Apple.
