Not an expert on Indian food but we really liked this place! It's one of the nicer Indian restaurants that I've been to with really attentive servers and nice decor. The menu was huge! They give you cut up pieces of naan and tikka sauce to start with, which was really good. I think we demolished it in 2 minutes! haha I couldn't decide so I went for Chicken Tikka Masala and my friends had Channa masala and some cauliflower dish. All the dishes were really good. I didn't think that it was exceptional, nor did I think that it was the best Indian food that I've had, but it was good! I also thought that even though it was delicious, the portions were a little small for the price - $17 for a small bowl of chicken tikka masala and it didn't even come with rice. I'd go back if I'm craving good Indian food and don't have a car to go to Devon.
