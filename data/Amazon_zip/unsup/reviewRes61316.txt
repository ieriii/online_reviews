I will say the food was delicious. The problem I have is,I got food catered from them and all went well with the food: and I understand that my mother went ahead and complicated it a little bit, but the manager was told that my mother would be the one to pick up and pay the rest of the amount due. They went ahead and ran my credit card first with out my consent ,and why they still had my credit card # is beyond me. My mom ended up paying with cash. When I checked my statement I seen that I was charged. I called to let them know what happened and the manager explained that she ran the card through and that my mother told her after the fact that she was going to pay, but in the manner that she was explaining this to me she was being real short almost snotty. which upsets me cause I didn't make the mistake one, and two never said they could run my card for the rest on Saturday when my mother goes to pick up. I really didn't like how she handled the situation. A lot of people loved the food and wanted to know where I got the food, so that they can have their party catered: but I'm not going to recommend this place because if this is how they handle a problem I don't want to send family and friends to this.
