I am not a tasting menu girl. I am a "give me a plate of my favorite pasta and let me stuff my face with it girl." (I know, classy.) I like to know what I am getting, which is usually the same thing I got last time if I loved it. But boy, am I glad I got to have this experience. Getting here for the earliest reservation of the night can be a little uncomfortable... you are greeted by 3 or 4 people standing around in a very spare and modern room... in silence. Where's the music? But once the space starts filling up, and you're onto your 2 or 3rd pairing of wine (which I highly recommend you get! Its unbelievable!), this incredibly special experience becomes truly exceptional. Every dish was amazing. But the ones I loved the most were a pork belly DIY asian spring roll type thing. I am glad I've had some model airplane building experience in my youth, because this one required some assembling and disassembling of the place setting. (Probably also helped that it was one of the earlier dishes, before the buzz of the wine set in!) Also fantastic was the most amazing piece of beef I've ever had... incredibly marbled (was it wagyu, perhaps?). I don't think I can ever go back to having a normal slab of steak.  Like going to your favorite band's concert... when dinner ended, I felt a bit misty, because it will be far too long before I get to have this kind of an experience again.
