The music is great but not worth the people you have to deal with. Also there is no amount of alcohol to make them palatable. Some refer to them as "classic Chicagoans".  If you think being rude, obnoxious, tacky, loud and miserable is a Chicago thing and ok then run on over because you will not be disappointed. Personally I treat people well and i prefer the same.
