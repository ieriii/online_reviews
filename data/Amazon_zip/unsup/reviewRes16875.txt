One of my favorite Latin American restaurants ever! I had the opportunity to eat here for lunch and dinner on two different trips to Chicago and I was not disappointed. Both times, I went here the staff was on point and the food...absolutely delicious. They made the experience that more fun! The best way to start off the meal is to order the guacamole which tastes like they made it about one minute before it's delivered on your plate. Having dined at Carnivale for dinner with a large group and a great host, we ended up ordering a plethora (every single) of sides and main dishes. Everything was amazing and tasted great! No extra sauce was needed for anything. I can't wait to go back to this place!
