If encased meat is the specialty, why cover it in so much "stuff"? Why not let the meat be the highlight. First, let me explain that my husband is OPPOSED to waiting in line to pay his money to anyone. Secondly, he LOVES food, meat in particular. Thirdly, he works hard for his money. Now that we have that out way. Had Chicago style dog. I am team Gene and Judes on this one. It was just a Chicago dog. And the bun was a bit soggy. A firm average dog. I know that many will find this blasphemous, but I call it as I see it. Had the alligator sausage. The meat itself was kind of tasty,but the toppings overwhelmed the meat. The cheese was thick and cold and again made the bun soggy. Hubby had the tueben. Sauerkraut was cold and the bun soggy. Tasted like a cold sauerkraut sandwich. The Diet Coke was good. You know how McDonald's has the "good" Diet Coke, well so does Hot Doug's. My husband says the Diet Coke was the best thing we had from there. Me, well, the fries were better than the soda. Would I suggest waiting an hour in line for a good Coke and decent fries? Only if you are extremely bored and looking to meet people in new and exciting environments. Maybe we aren't hip enough, our palette not refined enough or it was just an off day. Either way, if you must(like we "musted") then by all means go ahead. But not worth the wait nor the price. Affordability is subjective, but time is pretty concrete.
