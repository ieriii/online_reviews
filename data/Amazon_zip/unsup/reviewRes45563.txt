just checked this place out twice in a week. It's beautiful on the outside but when you go inside..WOW amazing. Almost makes you feel like you're in Europe. Great for having a drink at the bar, having dinner or for groups of people. this is great for any size group. Drinks are average prize and the food is delicious as well. just love this place
