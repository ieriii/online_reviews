Great burgers but I hate their condiments. It's great they make them in the kitchen fresh, but the ketchup tastes like thick tomato soup and the barbeque sauce doesn't even taste like bbq sauce at all! One perk is they can make any of their burgers a vegetarian burger. Great french fries but they'd be better with REAL ketchup! Try their cheese curds for sure and expect it to take a while to choose a beer since it's quite a list!
