If you haven't had Korean Fried Chicken, you are missing out, and Crisp is the best place to go in LP/Lakeview. The Seoul Sassy sauce is my favorite. The Buddha Bowls also always hit the spot when I'm craving korean food. This place is pretty small and usually packed so it can be difficult to get a seat but its worth the wait.
