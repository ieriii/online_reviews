I echo all the other posts that talk about the uniqueness of the menu offerings - things I didn't even know I would eat, such as beets!  Between the three of us we sampled at least ten different choices - not a bad pick among them. My fav was the grilled octopus. - incredibly crunchy texture with a great smokey grilled taste! Unbelievable!  All in all we stayed for some 4 hours and had a great evening. We started at the bar then moved to a communal table where we met some great folks from CA, and a few locals. The waitstaff was great, especially Molly, and the vibe was exciting. Lots of fun and can't wait to return on my next trip.  J
