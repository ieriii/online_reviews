Little Bucharest has a great atmosphere, great service, and great food! When I was there tonight the waitress and manager were extremely friendly and helpful. There was a wandering accordion player that really added a nice touch to the place. My table shared some delicious salads (the beets were amazing!) and the sausage-stuffed chicken was fantastic. Overall a great experience - I would definitely go back!
