It seems like lately I've been racking up a slew of bad reviews, thank goodness RJ Grunts will bring me out of my rut! RJ Grunts is what TGI Friday's dreams about becoming, but simply could never be. The burgers are divine, that goes with out saying. What I'm in love with is the salad bar. Yeah, it is a little pricey, but when you take into account all the pasta and potato salads, and fresh fruit, soups, and loads of different toppings for your salad its totally worth it! I guarantee anyone can stuff themselves silly and be completely satisfied on that salad bar alone.
