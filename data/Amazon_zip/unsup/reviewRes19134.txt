Still going downhill. So went there yesterday with two coworker, all three of us have frequented often. We got there around 5:15 and one person was meeting us so we were getting a drink at the bar while we waited. So I went up to the hostess stand and said we'd like a table once the third arrived and they asked about how long and I said about 20 minutes and they said that should be fine. They had plenty of tables available. She got there at 5:40 so I went back up and she said now it's an hour wait. So in 20 minutes it had suddenly been an hour wait? She was very rude about it too. So I asked what she had done when I came up 20 minutes ago (obviously the entire point was so that we can sit right away when she arrived) and she said well then we weren't taking names but now we are...WTF? All three of us were regular patrons that will not likely return any time soon.
