While in Chicago with a group of want to be food critics. We found ourselves traveling north on the "L". On a mission to find the land of crispy, Peking duck. Not ever having Peking duck before I did not know what to expect, but I'm always up for something new. We arrived at Sun Wah Bar-Bue, and was pleased at the open and clean eating area. 3 of us ordered ONE duck and split it 3 ways. WoW it was almost more than we could eat, the duck was great, and the rice that came with it was full of flavor, and the duck soup was just amazing. If ever in the Chicago area you need too duck on down and try you some!!
