Sabatinos is my favorite Italian restaurant! The food and service is excellent. They have everything to cater to everyone's tastes and are reasonably priced. Portions are huge (enough for at least 2 meals), but my favorite part about this place is the table side desserts. You can chosse from several desserts including bananas foster, cherries jubilee, or baked alaska and the owners prepare themselves at your table. This restaturant is not just a place to have a meal, rather a place for entertainment. Don't go here for a quick bite, rather plan on staying for at least 2 hours, as the meal is also a presentaion! They even have private booths for a romantic night out.
