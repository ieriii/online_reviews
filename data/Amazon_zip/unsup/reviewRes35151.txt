I came here for my birthday this past Saturday with a big group of 14 people! I was a little nervous because I heard and read that it is a small place, but they gladly accepted my large reservation and reaffirmed that they had the space. It was very nice, we had our own little area and the service was very attentive and great! Right away they gave us an ice bucket for the white wine and started us off with some edamame. The sushi was so good and they had some different types of rolls. When the food came out, they forgot about two rolls, but brought them out quickly and didn't charge us for them. The only problem was when the bill came, they charged us for some that we didn't order, but they took it off right away. I will definitely be back!
