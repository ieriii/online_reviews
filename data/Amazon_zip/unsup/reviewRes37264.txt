Stopped here the last night of my bachelor party. The condo we were staying at was a third of a mile away, so it was really convenient. Great selection of bottles and taps. The have a menu listing of both, so you don't have to strain your eyes looking at the wall of bottles available. The first floor is a bar in the front and seating for food in the back. Both were packed, but we found room in the bar area upstairs (which is cash only). Prices were relatively reasonable, perhaps a smidge high, but for the quantity of quality choices they have available, I can't complain. I would like to go back and try dinner sometime, but the bar suited our purposes perfectly for that night. I got to try a Goose Island Bourbon County (draft), a St. Bernardus Abt 12 (bottle), and a 3 Fonteinen Oude Geuze (bottle, $$$). Bar staff is knowledgeable and friendly, the latter of which was a pleasant surprise considering how busy they were. This was definitely one of the better beer bars I've ever been to and would not hesitate to return if I was in Chicago. Wish I could give it 4.5 stars. Five is a little too epic of a rating for it and four just doesn't seem fair.
