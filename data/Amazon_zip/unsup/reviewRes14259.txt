I must say that since coming to 90 miles, there really is no more room for another Cuban place. It has been said that once you try Cuban sandwiches you will never experience another sandwich quite the same. I think the melding of flavors is just the right pitch. From the garlic infused meats to the platanos maduros. Wow, just like old time sakes, a bit of the paste with a twist. You will not be sorry you came here.
