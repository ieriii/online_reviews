This is one of Rick Bayless's joints in Chicago, and my first experience at any of his restaurants. Overall I was pleased we stopped in for Lunch on a Saturday. Ordered the sopes rancheros, mole enchiladas, tamarind margarita Sopes: quite tasty may have been slightly better with a crappy shell (felt kind of soggy) overall would recommend beef was cooked perfectly. The mole enchiladas were fantastic, and I highly recommend them. The tamarind margarita was enjoyable, but more people seem to be drinking the Michelada.
