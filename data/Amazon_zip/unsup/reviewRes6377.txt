Came to wildfire last night for my favorite Chopped Salad and it was as good as always. This is one of the best restaurants in Chicago....they have it all from amazing salads, tasty steaks, and fresh seafood. Their dessert tray looks great as well, but unfortunately I'm always too full by the time it comes around.
