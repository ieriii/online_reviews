Yolk is my favorite breakfast place hands down in Chicago. The French Toast Combo or Crepe Combo are my all time favorites. I usually get a nutella crepe or banana foster's which comes with bacon, sausage links, eggs however you choose, and a delicious orange. I would highly recommend going here. Everything on the menu is extremely fresh and tasty. The service is fantastic as well. The only bad thing is having to wait. It is usually very crowded, especially on the weekend. So get their early!
