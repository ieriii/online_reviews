I would love to say a lot about Coast but I'm going to keep it short and sweet: * Outstanding options for vegetarians (I'd say the best in town) * Very creative and unique specials * Very very good prices (compared to other sushi places in town) * BYOB - with no corkage fee!! * Very nice decor and excellent waitstaff * Excellent ambience (music is not too loud, it's not too bright or dark, and the layout is very comfortable) * Jalapeno Miso - I'd go back just for that! If I absolutely had to complain about something, I'd say it's the fact that they don't have much by way of interesting desserts. But you really want to walk to another place for dessert after a sushi dinner anyway :) I recommend Coast highly to all my friends, and have no problem going there pretty much at any time!
