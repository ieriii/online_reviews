I have been to Piece a few times and have never been disappointed with the quality of eats. I'm not a huge fan of lots of red sauce slathered all over a pizza, so they are perfect for me in that regard. My only quibble, and it's relatively minor, is how packed together some of the seating is. If you're dining during a busy time, you need to prepare yourself for people bumping into your table/food when they're getting up or sitting down. But that minor inconvenience is so completely worth it for pizza that's this good. Oh, and a tip: it's even better the next day.
