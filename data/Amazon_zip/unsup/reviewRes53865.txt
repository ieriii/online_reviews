DO NOT SIT AT THE BAR!!! It's a wonderful place with a wonderful atmosphere, but when we went we sat at the bar and spent the entire time wishing we hadn't! Two brain dead bar-backs kept trying to figure out what they should be doing....(male and female) while the pseudo long-haired, short male bartender AND the big breasted female bartender completely ignored the bar patrons while they swigged wined.....got loaded and wasted our time. It was awful! When we FINALLY did get our food order it was great! The wine is great! But the idiots behind the bar ruined our visit. We plan to return.....sit at a table and allow the capable waitstaff to make our visit less annoying.
