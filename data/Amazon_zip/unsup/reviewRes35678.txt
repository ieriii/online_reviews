buzz-buzz-buzz-buzz-full page article in the Trib about the duck. This is why you are here.  Table next to us is three Brit couples with their kids and a huge cooler full of BYO white wine. The duck dinner is $32--this is a real special meal. The duck soup is not very good, and after a couple of visits, we just tell them not to bring it, but continue to make the same, lame Marx Brothers jokes. Also, (i am really giving away a secret) we ask for duck fried noodles, rather than the duck fried rice. Duck dinner with an order of the very special vegtables of the day is plenty for 3-4--BYO bottle charge is very reasonable and they have nice wine glasses-- great place-- Please don't go here--it will only make it more crowed for me! One thing mentioned in the Trib, is that now it is so busy on the weekends, you should call ahead and reserve a duck quack-quack-- finally, if you are not planning to get the duck--you probably will not think the place is worth the bother
