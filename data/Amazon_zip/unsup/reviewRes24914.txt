I've ridden past this Milwaukee Ave restaurant a plethora of times on my bike but hadn't eaten there until yesterday. I ordered the veggie burrito which was fantastic...simple...but delicious. The only complaint I have is that the salsa is in squirt bottles instead of bowls so it can get a little messy if you're a clumsy eater like myself. We ate outside, so I'm not sure what the inner restaurant is like but the outdoor seating area is great...in an ideal location for people watching. Good service as well. I would definitely go back.
