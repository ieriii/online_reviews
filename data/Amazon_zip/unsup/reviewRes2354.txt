keep it up doug! any restaurant owner that is the face of their business by working at it day in and day out is cool with me.  yeah there are lines, but you just have to go with that expectation. don't plan on being somewhere in an hour.  just go, relax, and enjoy a chicago original.  i've had a bunch here and not all of the crazy specials are amazing. but the fries and the BLT put me in heaven. somehow doug has a sausage that tastes like bacon. and it's not like the sausage has little bacon bits in it. it's the consistency or a brat, but tastes like bacon. add some tomato, avocado-may and lettuce, and you have the hot doug's BLT. AMAZING!!! i make sausage myself and I will be trying to achieve this feat for probably the rest of my life. genius. pure genius.
