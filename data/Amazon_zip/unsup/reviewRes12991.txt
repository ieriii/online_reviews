Reasonable prices and good food... I actually went with Fadia, the reviewer right before me... I liked the shrimp and rice appetizer, the shrimp was well prepared and I can eat rice with anything, 4 of 5 on that... Then I got the pork chops, they were very very well prepared. The only problem was that they were very sweet (though they are supposed to be) and mid way through the meal I realized I wanted something less sweet, so my fault on that one, 4.5 of 5. I really want to try the ropa viejo and next time I definitely will! For dessert we got the tres leches cake, it was ok but I wouldn't recommend it, 3 of 5 for that... The service was great and I loved the setup. It had a social atmosphere but it was just quiet enough where I did not notice it... 4.5 of 5 in plain experience... Overall, It was very good and there is a decent possibilty that I will go back.
