Even tho it's a little far from everything, San Soo Gab San is one of my favourite Korean BBQ restaurant in Chicago. I highly recommended it. They use old fashion charcoal and ventilation is a little on the weak side. Keep your wool sweaters and coats in the car or they will smell like BBQ for the next 2 days.
