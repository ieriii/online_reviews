Oh, what to say about this amazing place. We originally went there on a whim, and have been back countless times.  This is a great place to meet friends, or just a date night out. It is BYOB, and the corkage is waived with a minimum order. The sushi is so great you will not have a problem surpassing the minimum. I highly recommend the popper roll, it is usually a special, and a must have. I would also recommend the crunchy spicy tuna. The chefs here do an amazing job at combining flavors and the presentation is equally as appealing. I have tried several sushi places, and this one still takes the cake. Another bonus is that it is only a few blocks from, Hot Chocolate. I suggest Coast for sushi and Hot Chocolate for amazingly inventive desserts.
