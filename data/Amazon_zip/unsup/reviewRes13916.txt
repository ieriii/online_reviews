I'm going to keep this review short, because I don't want to share this place with anyone! I want it to remain my little secret.  Glenn's Diner is AWESOME. Here's what sealed the deal for me. I went with a group of 5 girls and we each ordered a different fish dish. Half way through dinner we each passed our plates to the right, all the way around until everyone had a bite of each dish. Every single dish was amazing. We were floored by the high quality and delicious flavor of everyone's order.  Nothing further. Let's keep this place a secret!!
