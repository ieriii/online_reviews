I am no pizza connoisseur, but this is some yummy pizza. I try to avoid eating pizza and will only have it two or three times per year. We ordered a thin crust pizza with lots of vegetable toppings. It was deeeelicious! The vegetables were fresh and the cheese was stretchy. I also like that the sauce is a little sweeter, but not too much. The thin crust was also very good. I love crunch edges.
