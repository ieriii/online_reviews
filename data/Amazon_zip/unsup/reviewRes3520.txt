I'm giving 4 points based on potential, because I'm sure that this is going to be a standby, even though I was half underwhelmed by my first foray at Crisp. While watching the SEC championship game this weekend, I had an intense craving for wings. My boyfriend has been talking about crisp forever, and since it was cold and snowy, delivery was the perfect idea. We got an order of 10 wings-- thank goodness I knew they were huge, because they really really are. Unlike bar wings, which are just the little wing or little drumstick, each of these wings is both the wing AND the drumstick-- plus the wing tip! So an order of ten here is like an order of 20 jumbo wings at a bar. We got the seoul sassy sauce and the bbq sauce, and that's where we went wrong. The seoul sassy wings were so delicious I can't get over it, but the bbq just didn't do it for me. It was REALLY spicy, and while I like spicy, these tasted like chili powder, which I really dislike. So this was just not hte flavor for me.  The delivery was SO fast-- MAYBE half an hour, and the delivery guy was so friendly. I'll definitely be ordering again, bc there's a ton on the menu I want, not to mention more seoul sassy wings! yum.
