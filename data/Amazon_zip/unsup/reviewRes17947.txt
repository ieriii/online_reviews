Absolutely fabulous! You have to be able to really appreciate the art of the cocktail to enjoy this place in its entirety. It's so nice to get away from sports bars and trashy joints. Definitely a sophisticated place with drinks and atmosphere to match. For the best experience, sit at the bar and watch the drinks being made. Each one is crafted from scratch and there is a whole "show" that goes into making each one.
