OK so I am impressed that there is a farm on the roof, but they are lacking in Alot of other areas like: Does everyone in the place have to have a pretentious attitude? I know chicken apple sausage is sort of healthy but I ordered regular sausage. This breakfast that costs $25 (including coffee) was not any better than I can make myself. The bottom line is skip this place, Chicago has Alot better options.
