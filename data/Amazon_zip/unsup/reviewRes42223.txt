Some scary sounding things on the daunting menu, but it was all good. As everyone else here is saying, the Pho is fantastic. I don't usually drink much of the broth in a noodle soup like this but it was just so good, so complex in flavor, I was drinking this like crazy. I got the extra large Pho, which is totally too big for a normal person. It had all kinds of unappetizing-sounding things floating in it like tendon and tripe, which turned out to be pretty good. Just close your eyes and give this stuff a try. Also had a sandwich, which was awesome. Next time I'll skip the spring rolls, but I'll be sure to get an iced coffee.
