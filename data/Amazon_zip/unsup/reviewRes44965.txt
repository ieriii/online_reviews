I can't say I'm a deep dish pizza connoisseur, but the pizza here sure was good. I was in Chicago for a conference, and asked every local I met what place they recommended for Chicago pizza. Giordano's was mentioned as the place to go almost every time. We almost didn't have time to stop in and try Giordano's stuffed pizza before we left. But on the morning we were going to go back home, I searched for the closest location to the hotel, and called in an order. At 10:30 in the morning, the actual restaurant wasn't open yet, but they were able to take my order right then--a definite plus when it takes about 45 min. from order time to eating time. They were also accommodating to make our medium pizza half "special" (sausage, green bell peppers, onions, & mushroom) and half cheese since one of my colleagues doesn't eat pork. And they didn't charge us for a whole "special" (which I thought they would do), but charged us for each half, making the total less than we anticipated. They also carry their half-baked & frozen stuffed pizzas at their restaurant, and you can take it on the plane to enjoy when you get home, which we did. What I didn't like was that everything was lumped together on our bill, so even though we only ate one pizza, the seven frozen pizzas we ordered for carryout made our "gratuity" almost the same amount as our meal. So word to the wise: order your carryout separately.
