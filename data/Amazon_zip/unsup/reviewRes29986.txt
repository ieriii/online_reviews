OMG I would drive from Detroit all the way to this place for the freaking Radical Reuben sandwich. I went here cause I read such great reviews about the food and how it was "the place" for vegan dining. WOW is all I can say I tried the Reuben and it was moist and the bread was toasted perfectly, real close to corn beef from what I can remember. When I make another trip to Chi-town I will definitely be back to this place, just for the Reuben!
