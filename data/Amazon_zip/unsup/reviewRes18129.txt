This is my favorite go to burger place in the city! The beer selection is amazing, and they are not stuck up about it like some other places in the city. Prices are great and service is friendly. I was overjoyed by how accommodating the servers were on my visit the other night. My friends had waited for our whole party of 8 to arrive, and when they did we sat down immediately. We then had a last minute add in of 2 more to our party. Without hesitating, the servers got another table ready for us just us as our friends arrived. Given how busy they were on Friday night, this was a huge gesture on their part.
