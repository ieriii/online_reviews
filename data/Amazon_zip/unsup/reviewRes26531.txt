BEST DEEP DISH Pizza in the whole world.... why stop @ Chicago...?I get the same toppings(mushrooms, onion and pepper) jus coz I don't think it can get better than that. I am also afraid, if it did get better, then I will become a Pequod junkie. They have a cool lunch special, personal pizza and a beverage (includes beer) for $5.99 which if you can get ur ass out during lunch hours, is totally worth the hike. We have actually taken the metra to the Clyborn station and walked 4 blocks to eat there. It's that good! Try it and u will be a believer too. :)
