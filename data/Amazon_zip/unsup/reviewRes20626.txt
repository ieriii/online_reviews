I went to The Gage for lunch today with some co-workers and loved it. I don't typically like a bar/pub setting, for any occasion, really. But this place doesn't really deserve to be called a "pub." It's a little classier - big leather booths, a long banquet, lots of dark wood and shiny tile, molded ceilings, etc. I had the pan roasted whitefish. I always have fish for lunch, regardless of where we go, and this was one of my favorite fish dishes of late. It came with little potato medallions and this truffle vinaigrette, which was great with the fish. The fish and chips looked great, if that's your thing, as did the burgers. The service was great - attentive, polite, prompt. The manager was a little over-zealous, almost to the point of being annoying. He stopped by our table several times to check to make sure things were OK, and kept saying "thank you so much for coming in." Not exactly a bad thing, but it became a little awkward after the third stop-by. Overall, a good experience for lunch. Oh, and dessert report (of course): the lemon meringue layer cake is delicious! Tasted the chocolate torte, which was just OK. Cinnamon straws with apple ice cream were very tasty.
