I thought this place was harmless pretentious fun and I totally agree with the person who says "its like they're putting on a little show for you..." because that is exactly what it is.  Creative drinks and a nice layout, combined with strict crowd control equals cute place to be. Oh, also great lighting helps you look sexy and youthful, as opposed to pasty/aging. Maybe meet your blind date here. If it doesn't go well pretend you got lost in the velvet drapery.
