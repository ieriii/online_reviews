Nom nom nom nom nom........ Worth the 45 min wait and lives up to the hype. Spectacularly delicious! I had the jerk pork sausage with mango mayo and crunchy and sweet papayas on top. Ohhhh my. The bf had the apple pork sausage with Gouda and mustard. Both were fabulous. I was happy with my choice, but probably changed my mind 4 times while waiting in line. Will definitely be back to try other sausages. I was very impressed with how much seating was available, and how fast the line moved, even though it seemed not many people left while we were waiting in line. Staff were very friendly as well. CASH ONLY though! We even waited in line for a good 10 minutes, asked someone if it was cash only (as most places in Chicago are), got out of line, drove to the nearest BOA I knew of, drove back, and got back to a much bigger line. Still worth it!!!
