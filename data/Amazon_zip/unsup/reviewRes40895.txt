I've put off writing this review because I've wanted to keep this place all to myself, and I know that as soon as word gets out about what an incredible place it is, I will never get a table there again. However... It's a new year, and I resolve to be less selfish. So here you are. This restaurant is amazing. The presentation is beautiful, the staff is really friendly (I don't think I've been there once where Kurt didn't pop out to say hi), and the food is too die for. It's a smidge too pricey to enjoy every day, but for a nice dinner out, it's perfect, and very reasonable, for the quality. I especially love that it's BYOB. We went there a few weeks ago for dinner. I had the rosemary steak, and my friend had the prosciutto stuffed chicken breast. Both were amazing, to the point where we were almost licking our plates. And the desserts...  It's making me sigh just thinking about it. I've been there for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and unfailingly, the first bite of food is just so astoundingly good.  I can't say enough good things about them. Bonsoiree is amazing. EDIT 7/7/07: Bonsoiree is no longer serving brunch, and they have increased the cost of the prixe fixe from $20 to $24--still an incredible bargain. On the plus side, they have a new summer menu which I can't wait to try. One other thing that must be said that hasn't been mentioned yet: The chefs and waiters are all adorable (and largely male). As my mother said when I took her there, "How awesome is it to have cute guys cooking for and serving you?" Indeed, Mom, indeed.
