I really can't understand the hype. I picked up some soup here for my sick fiance. She ordered eggrolls as well that I tried. They were nearly uneatable. I tried some of the noodles that came with her soup and they were dry and hard. Just awful. I think it will be really hard to go here again despite having rave reviews from friends. Would rather go to Me Dee.
