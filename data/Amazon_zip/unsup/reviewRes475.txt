Ok, so i don't think i need to go into details about each course, i mean, its all pretty fantastic. I'm giving 5 stars for the experience itself. If you have the financial means and are looking for a unique and very well done/organized, formal dining experience Alinea would be the place to live it out. My smoke slave and I did the TASTING but I highly recommend the TOUR (the tables on either side of us were indulging in the tour which has many more courses and are even MORE involved and intricate than the tasting)... I guess I was feeling cheap that night. Not only was the "food" amazing and presented in a really great way, we were doted on by multiple people-but not in a chaotic/hoovering fashion-from the beginning to the very end (about 2 and a half hours of grazing). And everything we consumed was explained and elaborated on, esp. the wine. So find yourself some dough and go!
