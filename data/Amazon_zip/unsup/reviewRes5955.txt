Yum yum. I still do love David Burke way more, but since I've eaten everything on that menu 3 times over, I was getting bored. Howard suggested we try Wildfire, and if you work in that building (which howard does), you get an additional 20% off :).  The bread basket was super yummy. Nice warm bread with white and rye. Had a wine flight, VERY healthy pours. The crabcake appetizer. Nothing to write home about. Standard and kinda expensive for two dinky crabcakes. If you've read any of my reviews, you know that Howard eats like a bird and we only get one appetizer and one entree. Our entree was the three trio medallions. AWESOME! And you get to try many different crusts. They cooked it perfectly and the meat was super juicy. We were plenty full with this and didn't have any room for dessert even if I wanted to. :(.  Pros:  Pretty inexpensive wine list (even if it isn't the most sophisticated list) Great crusts on the steak Cons: Service was just ok. I think b/c we only ordered one entree she stopped being attentive as she started. She didn't explain anything. I understand how annoying it may be that we share an entree, but we always do an appetizer and drinks which equates to two entrees (and then some if I end up drinking alot :) ).
