Wow what a place!! I went once with a few friends and got the seoal steak bowl. It was good. real good. However, that was not my 5 star experience. I went back after reading on yahoo that this place had the best fried chicken in the country. Was I skeptical? yes. Was I going to find out for meself? HELL YES! I was not disappointed. I got the wings in both their signature sauces: Seoal Sassy and spicy bbq. they were both good, but there was something about the sassy sauce that blew my mind. So flavorful and complex for a wing sauce, and on those oh so CRISPy wings. I will definitely be back and recommend you all do that same!
