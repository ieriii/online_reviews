We visited this lovely little spot for a special occasion, with a group of 10. The service was near perfect as was the meal. We chose the option of having the chef select our courses for us. At $35 per person we had double to triple the amount of food that we had expected, especially for a Saturday lunch. Items ranged from spicy sausage, buttery pesto scallops, rare grilled beef to wild mushrooms, flavorful fresh spinach and apples, fruits, vegetables, meats and cheeses! All the perfect sized portions for everyone in the group to nibble to satisfaction. My stand out favorites are the Spanish roasted peppers and a seafood, sausage and rice soup with a fried crostini and smoked paprika aioli! Don't for get to sample a cocktail or glass of house sangria, if you are so inclined! We enjoyed a grilled pineapple mojito that really hit the spot on a hot summer afternoon.
