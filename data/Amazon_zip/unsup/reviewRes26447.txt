I've been wanting to try this place after I read about the awesome reviews, and boyyyyyyy was I disappointed! I came here on a Saturday for my bf and my 5 year anniversary (AWWWW) and our reservation was for 12:30PM. We went upstairs and it was dead, maybe two-three other tables were occupied. I mean that's cool, it's kind of early for lunch ya know? For my first course I had the "arroz con la cazuela" - the broth with shrimp and chicken and the first tasting was good but I realized it was way too salty. Can you say sodium overload? My second course was the Mercat burger - Decent but too greasy and again, too salty. I also ordered the patatas fritas which was nothing extrodinary at all - tasted OK like McDonald fries. Shoot, I think I rather eat McDonald's fries. Overall, I was super disappointed in the lunch menu - there was not a variety at all. The service here was terrible also, we both had soft drinks and no one came to ask if we needed a refill except toward the end when we were paying our bill. This place wasn't even packed! I mean maybe 3 more tables joined after us but it was like 20 percent occupied. UGH. I might come back and give this place another try for the dinner menu- but I highly doubt it.
