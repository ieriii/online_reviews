i had the steak dish that was one of irazu's specialties and it was really not good. i know south american meat is generally less tender, but this was chewy, and the egg over the top didn't help. i loved the black beans and rice, and the plantains though. i'm willing to try it again because i've heard great things, but based on my one experience, i didn't love it. worth trying: plantains and black beans/rice
