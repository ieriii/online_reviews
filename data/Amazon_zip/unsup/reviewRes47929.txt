Not the celebration we'd planned. We went there for our 13-year-old's birthday and they volunteered to bring us a treat at the end of our dinner but completely forgot about it despite the fact that the waiter had plenty of (unwelcome) reminiscences and advice to share about turning 13. The pounding disco music was incompatible with a leisurely dinner, and much of the food we ate was over-salted. Everyone was smiley and friendly, and at the same time, it felt like they couldn't wait to get us out of there. Even the checklist of foods the waiter went through at the end of the meal felt like more of a challenge to us to find a reason to stay rather than a sincere attempt to make sure we'd tried as many dishes as we'd wanted. The hospitality was paper thin, and it left us all feeling badly treated. Many of the foods were fine, even though the claim of "seasonal" ingredients was a bit iffy. That's why I'm giving this place more than one star.
