This is the only Italian place worth anything in Chicago. Finally a place that serves a real sauce, not some watery, non-flavored tomato concoction. You get great, true al dente pasta, great sauces and even better value. Portions are huge, costs are low and atmosphere is relaxed. if you are looking for a relaxing, casual Italian dining spot this is it. Service is pleasant as well. And they threw in the extra veggie I asked for into my pasta dish, love it!
