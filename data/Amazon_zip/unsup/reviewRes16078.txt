What I like about Calo are the crab legs. They actually cut them across the top for you, so they are easy to eat, you do not need crackers, plus it is a generous portion. I have never seen anything like it. Their pizza is very good and their ribs are excellent. One item that I find very unique is the buffalo calamari. It is so good. Service can be iffy, the male waiters seem more experienced, but they do try to compensate if there is ever a problem. This is an old-fashioned supper club, with moderate prices and pleasant atmosphere. The bar area can get really loud sometimes, but overall a great experience. They have a lot right across the street which makes it very nice. Good place for large parties as well. Although I tend to get the same things over and over, they do have a great variety. They also deliver to Rogers Park. Very nice, and they are open til midnight.
