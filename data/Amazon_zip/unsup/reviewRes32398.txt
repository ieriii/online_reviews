I had a great start to a girl's night out here during their 5-7 "happy hour". I enjoyed a great sushi and saki pairing $20, and it was very much worth it. The decor is very visually interesting and our server was very attentive and entertaining. Drinks were superb. I'll have to go back and try their full menu!
