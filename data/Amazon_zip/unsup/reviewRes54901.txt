I've been going to Hop Leaf since the early 90's and have always considered it to be one of the best beer bars in the city. The place is sooo jammed anymore you really have to pick and choose your times to go. As with the other posters, I agree with their assessment about the staff, particularly the bartenders. I don't know what is with the service industry attitude anymore, I can deal with funny, sarcastic humor, but there is no room for bartenders to be condescending and snide, which is usually the case at Hop Leaf, unless you happen to be a regular, so I have found more friendly, better suited places to take my business.
