My fiance has been on a deep dish kick lately and whenever Friday rolls around he can't help but crave anything else besides this place. We have both been born and bred on Chicago's Deep Dish pizza and have tried them all. I've got to say the pepperoni deep dish here is awesome and is a fierce competitor. Notwithstanding the great pizza, be prepared to WAIT & WAIT & WAIT, especially on a Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and/or any major basketball & hockey game. This place gets filled to the brim quickly. And while the hosts try to guesstimate as best they can what the wait will actually be they are usually off by a half hour. Either way, once you do get into this place, prepare to stuff yourself. :)
