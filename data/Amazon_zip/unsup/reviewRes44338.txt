5 stars because its also about ambiance and presentation, not just food. I finally had dinner at Wakamono last night, and was extremely impressed. Having been a patron of Ping Pong for a couple of years, i went in with high expectations but also an idea of what my experience would be like, loud music, bitchy waiters and Pretentious gay boys (scratch the last one, otherwise i could be viewed as a hypocrite) All asspects i can live with! While waiting for the rest of our gang, my friend and i grabbed a drink in the coolest part of the restaurant, the bar. I bit secluded from the rest of the place, it was like sitting in the bedroom of a ruined 1920's geisha. the overly period design of this space, in stark contrast to the, stark yet organic dining area only added to the wonderfully visual experience. I also have to commend, Loren the bartender for whipping up a mean Hendricks and tonic. The cucumber was a great addition. Moving on to dinner, we were grateful because one of the gang is a raw fish fanatic, and always orders the BEST assortments, no mater where we go. The rolls and sashimi were extremely fresh, wonderfully displayed and OH SO yummy. As simple as it was, one of my favorites was the Shitake Tempura Maki , topped with a dollop of spicy mayo. What really made me love this place was their wasabi tobiko. This is truly one of my all time favorite Japanese dishes. Forget the fish, the rice, the tofu... I want something that makes my eyes water, throat sting and vision blur. Sadly, there are few places in Chicago that have wasabi tobiko that good. I'm always hoping that its SO strong i have to bang my fists on the table, and at Wakamono i actually did! Total brownie points!  This would be, and probably is a great date, restaurant... because the food is beautiful presented and fresh, the drinks are colorful and strong, and it wount turn your bank account into WaMu. Great Place, i will most defiantly be back!
