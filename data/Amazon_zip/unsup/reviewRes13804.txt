Good Seafood...in fact, best seafood around the area. Place is always busy and there's always new fish on the chalkboard. I enjoy coming during the week, which allows me to relax and enjoy the food with my wife. Food is fantastic and the presentation is always top notch. My only complaint is that it gets so busy sometimes, you have to scramble to find food at a nearby restaurant.  It's BYOB, but they do carry alcohol now.
