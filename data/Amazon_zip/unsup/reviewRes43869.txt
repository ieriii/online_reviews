I walked into this restaurant with a whole lot of build-up from friends so maybe that's not entirely fair, but I was expecting more. The dishes were a little "average" but the prices are reasonable. I would say I like the ambiance and feel of the place. It's a nice breakfast place to pop into once in a while but definitely nothing memorable. A-OK Milk & Honey.
