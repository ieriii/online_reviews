Mastros is great. I've been here quite a few times. It has a great interior decor and has a marvelous bar with live music. It's definitely a great place to meet your friends. I visited Mastros this evening with my friends. We all had steaks and they were cooked perfectly! I can tell you that this place is all about service. Our waiter was 'on the spot'. He was very attentive and nothing was missed and this made for a very easy evening. Get the butter cake!
