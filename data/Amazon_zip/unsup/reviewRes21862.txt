I got a polish sausage (i forget what they call it there, it's some complicated name). It was very good but I could have done without the bbq sauce they put on it, I'm more a simple mustard and grilled onion guy. The fries were also pretty hearty. Complaints: fairly pricey and I can't say I particularly enjoy the drive-in experience. I don't want to dirty up my car, I want to dirty up their tables.
