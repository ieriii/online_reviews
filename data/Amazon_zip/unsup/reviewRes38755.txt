This whole-deep dish pizza thing is more highly subjective than most other foods debates: best chile, best Mexican, best hot dog, etc. Everybody has his or her own unshakeable opinion. I, a mere San Diegan born in New York, like this Giordano's location the best of the three places I have been in Chicago. Lou Malnati's in River North was recommended to me and my friend by absolutely everybody we met in Chicago -- and absolutely everybody we met spelled or pronounced it hilariously wrong! How we ever found it, I will never know. New Menotti, Louis Minnetti's, Vincent Minnelli's -- you name it. And nobody we met could think of that place featured (as superb) by Anthony Bourdain on "No Reservations". So Giordano's, near our Loop hotel, was the default setting on two occasions. MUCH preferred the food and the rooms to Malnati's nightmare joint (which we kinda liked anyway despite the noise, waits and general chaos). At Giordano's we enjoyed the 12-inch SPECIAL with sausage, onions, green peppers and onions. It seemed deeper, BTW, than the one at Malnati's. At Lou's we had sausage only -- allegedly a favorite choice -- but I found it pleasant but very bland. Visitors be warned: there is NO agreement among the natives as to what joint is the best!
