Meatless biscuits & gravy, I'm sold. It's very hard to find vegetarian/vegan friendly diner food. Golden Nugget, IHOP, they all try to shove the meat at you, but then there is the beacon of Chicago Diner. It is nice to be able to go somewhere my vegan friend won't complain about (she never has any choices when we go to regular places) and somewhere I can choose anything on the menu. The inside is small, but diner-like. The service is usually very attentive, even on busy days and at peak times. It's the favorite place to go for our girls brunch or a light dinner before going out. As a former avid meat eater, this is somewhere I can get a gyro that doesn't make me miss meat. Thank you, Chicago Diner!
