We decided to get semi-dressed up for dinner and found Gilt to be reminiscent of some of our favorite San Francisco bars, so five of us came in for a 10:30 reservation on a Saturday night. We had to wait a good 15-20 minutes for our table to be cleared out, but afterward the service was very quick. Our waitress helped us pick orders by explaining ingredients that aren't listed. For example, the fries are made in pork fat which was a no-no for us. Not sure WHY they don't list all ingredients, but it was really helpful that she pointed all of this out. She also brought a vegetarian/vegan menu that isn't provided unless you ask. Including stuff I ordered and nibbled on from friends, I tried: the fennel apple salad (best version I've ever had, the cheese is a great touch); smashed potatoes (get the jus on the side, it's unnecessary); blackened cauliflower (not my fave; too many onions and not a great taste); Pacific shrimp cocktail (huge shrimp; tastes as you'd imagine). And for drinks, the French 75. Overall, good dinner.
