Love this place. Gnocchi and mussels are amazing. I tried to the bone marrow on the recommendation of others but i thought it was kind of gross though everything else was yummy. Atmosphere is also very good. Only down side is the service leaves some to be desired. Oh well, the drinks, food and overall fun of the place make up for it.
