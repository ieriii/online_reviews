- Great sushi. The rolls are creative, but not so over run by mayo or other such ingredients. I would recommend the Emerald Roll. - Atmosphere is fun but casual. If you have time, grab a drink before or after at the bar next door. I usually have an Asahi with Sushi, but the martinis are worth it at the bar. Neighborhood feel. Vibe is sort of Colorado Lodge meets Japan.
