Good vegetarian/vegan variety. The food is prepared well, flavorful and appealing to the eye. However, the prices are a tad high, but I dont mind going there every so often to enjoy being able to order anything on the menu and sample things I dont know how to make myself. Ive found that a few meat-eating companions do enjoy the fare, as the menu appeals to the tried and to vegan, to the flexotrian(one who eats meat but sometimes enjoys vegetarian cuisine) and everyone inbetween.
