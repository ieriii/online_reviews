This is one of my favorite restaurants in Chicago!!! It's a really cool space - converted warehouse with really high ceilings, big, bright decorations and lots of energy! I'm sure it would be an incredible place to have a wedding reception. Anyway... let's talk food and drink. It's a really fun combination of Spanish and Latin American food and drinks. They have great sangria, and killer mojitos here! Nice wine list as well. The ropa vieja as an appetizer is delicious. We've had some of the ceviches too - I think there was a butterfish one on special one night that was amazing. As far as entrees, I ALWAYS get the churrasco. It's so delicious that I can't bring myself to get anything else. My husband gets some other kind of steak and also loves that. I've had friends get the fish special and love those as well. Sadly, I've never made it to dessert so I can't speak about that. But really, LOVE LOVE LOVE this place.
