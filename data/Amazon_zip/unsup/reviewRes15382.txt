I adore the entire concept that Violet Hour represents - a dark, quiet, speakeasy, with simple yet entertaining rules, and a cocktail menu that provides for all tastes. I feel like Chicago lacks this option. We walked back and forth down the block a few times before I realized where the door was, but upon entering, our 7 person party was sat immediately. We had called ahead due to the size of our party. I'm still a little confused on this no reservations policy, because we definitely seemed to have a reservation. The ambiance oozes romance, and would be my go-to spot for setting the mood. The high back chairs, open spaces, dim lights and creative cocktail options combine for the perfect date recipe. I was a little shy with the cocktail list, but my cohorts were adventurous, trying the Pimm's Cup, The Moscow Mule and all variations of fruited cocktails. To start, I had an amazing glass of red wine, and split a bottle of champagne before I was ready to dive in. The Romeo & Juliet was amazing, the cucumber taste was absolutely refreshing, and I've been dreaming about it ever since. We also ordered the Edwards Ham, Grilled Lamb Sausage, Artisan cheese plate and some sort of shrimp tartare. All the food was delicious, but nothing particularly memorable. However, this worked well alongside drinks that offer a medley of engaging flavors. Overall, Violet Hour was a major win.
