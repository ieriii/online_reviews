The line sucks but the ambiance and drinks are pretty cool. We came here in the fall with some friends and sat by the fireplace. We got a few bowls of punch...yum! Everything was great and it was worth the wait. The bartenders seem very good here. I asked for a ramos gin fizz and it was almost as good as the ones my great uncle used to make.
