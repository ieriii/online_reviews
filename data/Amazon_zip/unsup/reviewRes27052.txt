We lucked out on the hour and a half wait with immediate seating at the counter in the back. I preferred it over a table since it was more interactive with the adjacent kitchen and yet strangely intimate. TRIO CEVICHE Fresh and scrumptious, with three different interpretations of ceviche (traditional to fusion) coupled with dollops of Rick's guacamole. Definitely recommend it as it was a great starter to our meal! TAMALES DE ELOTE Moist, subtle, and decent. Paired well with the fresh crema and what seemed like bites of onions and chiles COCHINITA PIBIL I opted for the Wednesday special, came piping hot with a side of tortillas. While the meat was perfectly prepared, I was underwhelmed. Of the many times I'd frequented Xoco next door, it literally looked and tasted like the deconstructed torta but with more cheese and beans. DUCK I had a taste of my dining companion's dish and it was excellent-- tender and savory. Don't know if I'd order this dish for myself since it was too meat-tastic. I was impressed by the fact that every arrival of a dish was described with details of elements on our plate. However, service was slow and we felt forgotten in the dinner rush. Perhaps rightfully so since we were seated at the chef's counter. For Xoco regulars, I definitely recommend branching out and being adventurous, since there were countless of items paralleling next door.
