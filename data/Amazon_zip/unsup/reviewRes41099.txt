I was here on a cold rainy day with my sister-in-law and brother-in-law. We were in the Bryn Mawr area; some wise person in the car( I know it wasn't me) suggested Vietnamese food. Parking was a pain in the rear...did I mention it was raining? We parked on Winnemac Avenue and walked across to the restaurant. The Menu is extensive, when I say extensive I mean EXTENSIVE! It took me a while to decide what I wanted to eat. I got the grilled pork sandwich. It comes in a French bread roll, the bread itself was outstanding. A good portion of well marinated, grilled pork with slices of radish, carrots, and cucumbers. Yummy! SIL got the beef pho, she didn't add any of the condiments(hot sauce, jalapenos etc) It was very mild yet flavorful. BIL got the roast pork sandwich. It did not stand up to my sandwich, it came with Char Sui, carrots, cucumbers radish and cilantro. The saving grace was the bread. Hubby got the beef Pho, he went crazy with all the condiments and for once I did not scold him, because I liked the resulting concoction, it was hot and spicy. I liked eating here, if you are looking for super duper ambiance this is NOT the place. I am definitely going back as soon as I possibly can.
