Every Sunday morning I go to Milk and Honey with a massive headache, exacerbated by the cacophony of crying babies and miscellaneous needy yuppie consumer noises that great you when you walk past the people standing in line, people who may not know they aren't waiting to get into the Boundary. It's important to remain stoic while people cut in line. Once in awhile I'll raise my head from the elitist newspaper I read to pan across the cafe and wonder if it's possible to be 30 and interesting. Hipsters? I haven't seen a hipster in Milk and Honey since 2006--before they frowned upon people who sit and read on the weekends. Yup, read it on the wall for yourself. It might as well say "go to Alliance!" It's worth putting up with for the granola yogurt. The girls who work there are generally nice too.
