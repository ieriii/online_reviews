Central to any place you might want to walk to in Chicago, the Felix is a great base-camp for any adventures you're planning to have. It is certified Silver LEED status, which also makes you feel good that about Felix's commitment to the environment. The rooms are small, but well designed. The only lacking component is a spacious closet, so if I had stayed for a week or longer, I would have grown tired not having enough space to hang clothes. On the other hand, the bed is the most comfortable one I have ever slept in at a hotel and the shower is well designed and doesn't take forever to heat up. The bar is a great place to relax, though they could bump up their selection some - the night I went down to relax they only had 3 beer offerings. Another big plus - Absolutely free internet service, which was fast. Also a plus, no annoying login process each time you connect! Next time I head to Chicago, I'm calling Felix.
