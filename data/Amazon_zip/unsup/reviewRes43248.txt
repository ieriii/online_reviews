There are definitely better brunches in the city but M&H is good for something quick. Their star is the huevos rancheros. Unfortunately their baked items (cookies) and pancakes (we got the oatmeal) are pretty bland and dry. Service is fine, nothing mind-blowing. You line up to order your food and pay before sitting down at a designated table that the servers save for you.
