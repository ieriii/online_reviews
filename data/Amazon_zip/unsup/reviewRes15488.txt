I got extremely lucky last night, because my friends are big fans of Revolution and had already been there drinking for 2 hours before I got out of class, so I didn't have to wait at all for my seat. That said, there were a million people standing around waiting so I can see that the wait is a bit crazy. It was very loud, but what do I expect on a Friday at a new popular place. On to the most important part, the food. There were four of us we had: The cheese plate, the lamb with rapini special, a chicken and couscous salad, and two working man's burgers. I had the burger with the garlic cream cheese mashed potatoes. Can I say genius? I have never had cream cheese in my potatoes and I'm already craving them again. The burger was extremely good. Everyone seemed to very much enjoy everything they had, except for one of the cheeses. I like adventurous cheeses, but that was an extreme thing. I have no idea what it was, but I don't think I ever need to smell it again. For beers I only had the Wit, which was really good. I'll be back, but I may wait awhile until the buzz wears off. The waitress was super nice. She split the tab for us, because I had somewhere to be and the friends I had met were going to continue drinking.
