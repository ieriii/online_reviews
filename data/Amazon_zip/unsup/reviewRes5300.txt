I'm a big fan of pork, so this place is like heaven!! Went to the restaurant the past few times I was in town, and it never failed to satisfy my cravings. The place feels cosy and great for hanging out or a romantic dinner with your loved one. Service was great, they had no seats when I went there for thanksgiving, so we chose to sit outdoors, the waiters brought tons of fire heaters!!! Recommended dishes: Pork fried almonds Roasted bone marrow with herbs (smears) Pig's Ear with Crispy Kale Pork Blade steak *Smears come with this awesome toasted bread, ask for more refills!!! For dessert, try Sicilian Iris or the Festa di Santa Lucia Crema the Panino con Nutella was good, but a little too sweet for me.. One thing to note, you might want to make a reservation beforehand, they tend to be really packed even for lunch.. and especially dinner.
