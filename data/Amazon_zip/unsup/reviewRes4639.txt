My boyfriend and I finally got a chance to come here on a Friday afternoon at 4:30PM. We were expecting there to be a wait--but fortunately, there was not! Our waitress Heather was extremely knowledgeable with the wines and was very helpful in deciding what we should try. The food portions were PERFECT. And they came out right as they were plated which was awesome! We started off with the chorizo stuffed olives which was AWESOME. I didn't expect them to be so salty, but they're olives--couldn't expect anything else. :) If you ever try these, wait like 5 minutes because they are HOT and straight out of the kitchen! We then had the milk braised pork shoulder with mashed potatoes. Need I say more? The mussels w/ pancetta - oh my god. Be sure to ask some extra bread because you'll need that to scoop the rest of the broth out. The flavor--so delicious! We also got the Chicken thigh kebabs with Fried Smashed Potatoes & Tzatziki sauce. This dish was okay. I was a fan of the fried mash potatoes because I do love my carbs :) The tzatziki sauce was stellar and is definitely great with the chicken. Despite the slow service and attentiveness, i give the Purple Pig a 4 star! Will definitely come back and next time I'll try more of their wines. Needless to say, their food was VERY good. Highly recommend!
