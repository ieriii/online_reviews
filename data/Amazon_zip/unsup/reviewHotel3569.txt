BEST authentic "powder room" in the city BEST brunch EVER - we had vouchers, so make that a free brunch-wow. The eggs were perfect and potatoes seasoned with dill were incredible.. BEST old school charm BEST gold coast location My boyfriend and I used priceline for a last minute weekend getaway, spent about 100 bucks for the cutest little room ever in the most charming boutique hotel ever. The whole time I felt like I was in a old new york city black and white movie. Great for romance for sure, maybe not very kid friendly. If I had one single downside it could have been no pool but I barely noticed. Guys will love the bar downstairs, it is so old school but also has great drink selection, appetizers and big screens for the game.
