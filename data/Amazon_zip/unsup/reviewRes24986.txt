We went here on the day before New Year's and splurged on the Chef's Luxury Tasting Menu with wine flight for 2 at $135 apiece. (That was done largely because we hadn't tried anything there before and wanted to get immersed in the full dining experience.) The interior design of this place is quite magnificent to behold. Our server was super attentive, and even gave us both an extra glass of wine for our final item not coming out with the rest of the 3rd course. (We received 12 plates total for 3 courses.) It probably did help a lot that we arrived for early seating, too. My biggest pleasant surprise were how well the exotic mushrooms tasted just by themselves (and I'm normally not a fan of mushrooms by themselves). We would certainly come back here again when staying downtown, and next time just to try out a few individual items on the menu. (Of course it is pricey, so plan to save up!)
