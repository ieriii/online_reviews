Wow!Went here for dinner last week, I can still taste the filet mignon.....melts in your mouth like butter. The best steak I have ever had. Our waitress was very friendly and humorous, sometimes hard to find in nice restaurants downtown. Not stuffy at all. The steaks are very generous, well worth the money. You can eat a la carte style, they have great sides to pair with the steaks. My only complaint concerns the bartenders that served us while we were waiting for a table....first they charged us for a drink we did not have (we only had 2, how difficult is that?) and then were kind of rude when we tried to correct our tab. But other than that, great food, great time!
