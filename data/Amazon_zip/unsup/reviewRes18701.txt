The Bad Apple Burger was good, and the other menu items and beer list looked like they had a ton of potential. The "truffle oil" fries were just greasy - next time I am going to try a different flavor.  The thing that annoyed me though, was the ketchup. Why must places try and make their own ketchup? Heinz and Hunts did it right - your homemade ketchup isn't good - ruined my burger.
