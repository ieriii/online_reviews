I have long worshipped at the sacred altar of Bayless. With reverential care, I view my edition of "Rick Bayless's Mexican Kitchen" as my dogeared, sauce splattered dinner party Bible, which has sated many a palate. Chicago owes him a great debt for contributing to the establishment of the city as a premier dining Mecca. The world at large owes him heaps for shattering the concept that "Mexican" is simply interchangeable with Taco Bell, football sized tacos and Tex-Mex fajitas, and proving it instead to be one of the most diverse, rich and historical cuisines around. Sure he's a Gringo, but he's done the legwork. While I'm happy for his recent Top Chef Masters win, it troubles me the way the Food Network makes movie stars out of chefs. I am unconvinced that the endlessly long lines here at Xoco are primarily driven by a need for authentic Mexican street fare. The frenzied riot gathering on Clark Street seems instead to be in line for a Brad Pitt sighting, or a Johnny Depp premiere. That said, while I have enjoyed my several visits to Xoco, having eaten authentic Mexican street fare a great many times, I think Bayless is doing himself a disservice referring to the grub here as that. The offerings here are certainly inspired by, and share names with, the food widely available in their delicious natural state in Mexican markets and bus-stops but frankly can never hope to be so ephemeral. Poshified ingredients, tamed spice, and an easy hand of chiles hamper as opposed to elevate; and I find myself wanting more. But, I still have to hand it to the man... when people leave here having tasted something new and interesting, and can view "Mexican" as culinary brilliance for the first time, as opposed to a tepid cuisine of hard-shell tacos, he is doing his job and spreading the Gospel. Amen to that.
