Been there many times. Good place. Fillet trio very good as is the Parmesan Crusted Halibut. Good burgers also, try the Black & Blue. The bar is a good for drinks or as an option to dine without the wait. Also a good place for dessert & a night cap. Only bad experience was New Years Eve when the SERIOUSLY over booked
