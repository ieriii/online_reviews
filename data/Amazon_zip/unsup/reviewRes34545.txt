Falafel Sandwich!!! I like it mild, but you can also get it medium or spicy. I looked at it, and thought, "Vegan, huh? Idunno about this." I saw cucumbers, hummus, and something I can't explain called falafel, all cut up and crammed into a pita. Now, I am tolerant (not necessarily crazy about) each of those ingredients on their own, but when combined, they join forces to become a sandwich Voltron in your mouth! They didn't skimp on the portion size, either. That sandwich was awesome and filling, and the service was fast and friendly. Oh, and did I mention it was only $3.75? Da-Da-Da-Daaaaaaa (That's the sound of "The Price is Right" theme song in my head)! I will definitely be back.
