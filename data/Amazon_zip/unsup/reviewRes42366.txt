We came here as a group of 6 and did not know what to expect. The place was dark with some communal seating. We ordered duck confit - the confit was shaped into sausage like discs, and served with bread & lettuce. Interesting, but not impressed. orecchiette with spicy pork sausage & herbs - VERY good. the orecchiette was al dente & the dish well seasoned grilled duroc pork belly - very good, very heavy beef pot roast - wow! very tender & juicy. I was really impressed with the entrees. They were well thought out and executed. I would have loved to try something else.
