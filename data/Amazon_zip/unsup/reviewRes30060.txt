The food here is very good, but I have to say that it was definitely not worth the 3 hour wait and the hype. Here's my take on the dishes we had. 0. Sweet fried plantains - these were the best plantains I've ever had and the best of the dishes we ordered. They had a nice crispy exterior and come with homemade sour cream and fresh cheese. Delicious! I could have eaten 2 or 3 orders of this. 1. Guacamole - pretty good, with some sort of fresh red pepper mixed in, but it was a tad on the bland side. It could have used some salt and possibly some lemon juice. I like the guac at Qdoba as much or better. 2. Chicken taquitos - these were good, but not so different than your typical taquitos. They do come mounted on a nice little mound of guacamole which added to the value. 3. Falda Asada "Brava":  spicy serrano-marinated grass fed flank steak (from Bill Kurtis's Tall Grass) with spicy salsa huevona (hand-crushed, grill-roasted tomatoes, jalapenos). Grilled knob onions and sweet corn tamales (topped with homemade sour cream and fresh cheese). 29.00  I'm not a big steak guy, but this was pretty good. To be frank though, I enjoyed the sweet corn tamales more than the steak itself. It certainly wasn't worth $29. 4. Tacos al Carbon: wood-grilled meat, poultry, fish or mushrooms sliced and served with roasted pepper rajas, two salsas, frijoles charros, guacamole and homemade tortillas. 16.50  We had these tacos with pineapple pork, but we could not really taste the pineapple and so I think these were fairly mediocre. The corn tortillas that accompanied the meal were good and fresh which I enjoyed. These were probably the 3rd best part of the meal (after the plantains and the tamales).
