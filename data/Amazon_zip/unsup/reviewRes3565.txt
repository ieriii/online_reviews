I hate that NYC is always so far ahead of the curve (they know it and they love it), but Korean style fried chicken has been the rage there for quite some time. I finally had to try it a few weeks ago and see what the hype was about. It wasn't a single factor, but the moistness of the chicken, the tastiness/crunch of the skin (it wasn't fatty) all made for the best chicken wings I've ever had. I'm sitting here hungover and that's all that I can think of right now. Both the Seoul sassy and the Spicy BBQ were both good, a little salty on the sassy and pretty hot BBQ ones which was a nice change (normal spicy wings never really seem spicier, only saltier/more sauce). When Asians say spicy, they usually aren't playing around, this time was no exception. I also tried the burrito, it was ok, didn't love it. My other gripe was I asked the cashier what he recommended on the menu and he said the fries! I'm still mind blown by this, the fries were mediocre at best. Either way, its a moot point. I won't be ordering either the burrito or fries again, not because they were bad, but because they will merely cut into the maximum number of wings I can consume.  For all the penny pinchers complaining about their "high prices" for just a few wings, do your research (and realize you pay for what you get most of the time, head to BW3 if you want cheap generic wings). It's a WHOLE wing, so basically two regular pieces you would get anywhere else and they are 50% bigger. Three or four wings would probably make a decent meal for a regular person, but next time I go I'll take a dozen.....of each flavor.
