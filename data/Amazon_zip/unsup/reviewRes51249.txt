Just moved to Chicago about 2 weeks ago and this was the first place in the neighborhood that I ate without looking up reviews. I highly enjoyed it. The food was good and filling and not expensive at all. The guacamole was quite tasty. I had the banana margarita which was AMAZING. I've never been to a place that offered that flavor. The next time I went, I had the strawberry margarita and it was equally as good. The only complaint I have about the place is the building itself. It there is a decent amount of people inside, the sound is a bit much. It can get very loud and echo-y; not ideal for conversation. The service was fine. Seated quickly, filled my water frequently and the waitress was good. I would definitely go again.
