This place is a 1950s pharmacy--with scrubby jackets being worn by the waitstaff, huge bulb oddly bright yellow lighting, and slightly worn brassy/gold trim--mixed with medieval long wooden tables and high-back upright chairs. My friend loved it. I thought it was a little too wannabe-NYC. But, to each their own. Beer list, excellent, so in that, it is pub-like. I'm a veggie--so no food here I was particularly intrigued by, but I didn't try anything either, so I can't knock it. If you're veggie though, don't expect a full meal here... Just drink the beer.
