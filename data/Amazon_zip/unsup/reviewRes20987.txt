Very good sushi! The restaurant is very cool inside, kind of dark, but very comfortable. BYOB with no cork fee which was a huge plus. We had several things while we were there but the highlights were the Hamachi Carpaccio and the Volcano roll. We had several other things as well, and everything was good.
