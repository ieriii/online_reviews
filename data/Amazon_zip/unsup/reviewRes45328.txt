I understand that this is an supposed to be an upscale Irish pub, but the dim lighting made it difficult to enjoy the ambiance. In fact, it was just too dark, unless you didn't really want to see your date's face (then this place would be appropriate for that) One thing that caught my attention was the 1/2 off all bottles in the restaurant. We ordered Pinot Grigio that was Italian in origin. My friend loved the selection. Also, I ordered the 1/2 rosemary chicken. However, it was nothing extraordnary. In fact, Harold's chicken probably tasted better than their chicken with mashed potatos and broccoli. Although I loved the wine, I was not impressed with this place simply because what you are getting is okay quality at elevated prices.
