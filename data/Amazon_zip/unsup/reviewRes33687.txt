I am in love with the menu at this place. It is so difficult to choose what to get because there are so many dishes that look good on the menu. When I am feeling like having lunch I usually get the BLTA with onion chips. I love to concept of a BLT with avocado. They put plenty of bacon on it as well. The service is always fast and friendly as well. My only gripe is that I wish it were open later.
