The Purple Pig is the embodiment of the holy trinity of cheese, wine and swine....When it comes to TV shows reviewing restaurants it can sometimes look staged and well, very much like a paid advertisement. So, when I saw the tail end of a clip of The Purple Pig on one of those food TV shows I was skeptical but intrigued to the point I said "the next time I am in Chicago I will check it out." Funny how life works because color me pink I found myself in Chicago this week. Not to say that I am a pessimistic New Yorker; maybe I am a little snobbish because I do live in the city known for being the crossroads of the world of fashion, culture, finance, beauty and food. Coupled with the fact that I live on the upper West-side where there are an abundance of great restaurants - large and small. Pessimistic no. A realist with high expectations when it comes to all things service, food and fashion? Hell yes. Let me say this...if The Purple Pig was in NYC...folks here would be lined up around the corner for days on end. This place is absolutely off the hook. The portions are sized perfectly to share and the prices range from $5 to $23. So, you can eat like a pig (no pun intended) and not break the bank. Don't even get me started on the selection of wines. Its freakin amazing! How do I explain amazing in a way one can understand? Try this...not only did I find myself eating everything on the plate but I was trying to find a way to be able to lick the crumbs that fell off the plate and onto the counter without looking like -- dare I say? A pig. So, if you like cheese, wine and swine and don't want to break the bank.... run do not walk to The Purple Pig.
