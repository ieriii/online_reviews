The food is AMAZING!! The chefs also do a fantastic job of accommodating dietary preferences and food allergies. We went last week on no menu Sunday and both ordered the seven course meal. My date was a pescatarian with a number of allergies and they really did a bang up job making him alternate dishes. We both agreed it was possibly the best dining experience of our lives! Also, it's BYOB (without a cork fee!) and they will refrigerate any wine you would like them to.
