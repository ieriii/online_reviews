The best barbequed duck I've ever had. This is a dish I normally don't like, because it's always too sweet and too rich. At Sun Wah, it's neither; it's perfectly seasoned and it's "juicy just right"! The barbequed pork is great, too, and when we went they had these delicious stuffed jalapeno appetizers. The waitress explained dishes to our goofy crowd with great patience, and laughed at our bumbling attempts to clear space when she'd bring yet another plate of food, which we deserved (the laughter, not the food).
