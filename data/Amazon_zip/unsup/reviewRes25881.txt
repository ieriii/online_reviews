I tried this place this weekend and I've been to Melting Pot before and wanted to try this place as well. As far as the ambience is concern not too happy about it. It was dark, low ceiling basement and I wasn't able to see anything on the menu not unless I grad the candle sitting on our table to put it by the menu to see. We were seated on this tiny little table for two. The waitress was really nice and gave us sample to sweet wine they have before we orderd a full glass. We were recommended to order the PRINCE GEJA'S COMBINATION which was a little too much for me. It came with cheese fondue which I feel like the wine after taste was very strong. The chocolate fondue was really good. The sauces was really good. Our meat and seafood were cooked in oil which I was not crazy about. Overall is good but I wouldn't really say i would love to come back anytime soon but I kind of have to because my kids wants to try.
