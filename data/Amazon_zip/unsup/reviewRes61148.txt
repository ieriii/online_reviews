very disappointed! a bunch of us went - enjoying the day in chicago!  line was pretty long but we got in prob. 20 mins (which was a shock) - were up on the 3rd floor - waitress (ashley) came over got our drinks & appetizers order - all going good! they came pretty good time, all good - ordered pizzas & more drinks - pitchers of beer - (+ a chicken strip dinner & i reminded them, like not to forget) well, well, well, we were damn thirsty - hot out & walking around all day - & no beer yet - we waited prob 20 mins +  so 2 of our group decided to go up to beverage station & try to get some & the people were very rude & said sit down someone would be with us - well ashley never came back, we saw her running around, but i guess she forgot about us - but a very nice gentleman - joshua - was the waiter who finally took care of us & was excellent & so pleasant - he should have gotten all of the tip (since it was a party of over 10, tip was included) + i am an overtipper but not this time (joshua got a little extra) anyway - he got our beers very fast & asked what else we needed & then finally prob bout an hour ? we got our pizzas & of course - they forgot the chicken - whatever!  manager talked to us - took some $$ off - but no way would i ever go back - been before but not to this one - very rude & i didn't even mention a waiter who came by & ''threw" crayons @ 2 of our high schoolers in the group & one pack landed in my niece's beer - whatev - give me giordanos, give me 'piece' love them - hasta la vista gino's
