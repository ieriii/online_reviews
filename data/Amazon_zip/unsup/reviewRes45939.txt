What's up with waiting system here? You put your name in and stand in a terrible lobby at the bottom of two steep escalators. Why not use buzzers? It would make SO much more sense. You could hang outside or go to the bar. Or maybe you can....they just didn't offer it to us. Everything took too long. Coffee, food, service, water, etc. Portions are too big. Don't make me think I should be eating all of that.  My dessert was tasty....as I could expect.  I will only go here if I have to.
