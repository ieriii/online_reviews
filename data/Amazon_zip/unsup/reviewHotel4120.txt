Don't judge it by the exterior... Today was my first time staying at the Hyatt Regency in Chicago and when the taxi pulled up to the entrance, I must say I was unimpressed....it looks very old and dated. Once I walked through the doors however, I was so pleased! It's very modern and updated inside. There's a beautiful fountain in the entrance that a bistro/bar overlooks. There's also a 2nd floor bar that overlooks this same fountain. I make my way up the escalators to the 2nd floor check in and was greeted by Jason Dennard at the check in counter. He was so pleasant and accomodating. He took the time to ask where I was coming in from, how was my day, etc. He asked my prefernce for a room, ie; king or 2 queens...I respond by saying 'king'....he looks for the room options and informs me that the only available king room is by the elevator - in which he suggested I don't take that room. I really appreciated him telling me this, particularly after reading some of the other reviews regarding noise.  I make my way to the west tower to go to my room. There's a west and east tower - this place is huge, but everything is well marked and easily walkable. I decide to forgo a night on the town and order room service - the menu offers all the basics - nothing too fancy unless you choose to order from Stetson's (their in-house Steak House) but expect to pay $34 for a filet or $30 for the salmon. Instead, I opt for the vegetarian wrap, tomato soup, and a glass of Oregon pinot gris. Either I was really hungry, or this was the best 'room service' meal I've ever had. It was so fresh - the wrap had asparagus, red pepper, eggplant, zuchini, and a white bean puree to hold it all together. I honestly wasn't expecting much, and this far exceeded my expectations.  The rooms are comfortable with modern decor. I would definitely stay here again.
