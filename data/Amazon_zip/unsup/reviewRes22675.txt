I feel bad giving this place a 3 because I would definitely want to go back again to try some of the other items on the menu. We went here on a Tuesday (Fat Tuesday) with a group of 11 and I was shocked that they had a table ready for us so we didn't have to wait. The place was pretty much dead which was shocking after reading the reviews about the long wait. So we definitely lucked out with that. We ordered some of the appetizers (guac, fried plantains) and I got the tilapia tacos. I don't think I would get them again, but they were good.  Their menu has some really good options, and their sandwiches are REALLY cheap (I'm talking $5ish cheap). My tilapia platter was more expensive (still cheap though), but I think I would go with the $5ish meals since they looked yummy and were so inexpensive. I definitely would be back to enjoy the more from their menu and enjoy the fact that it is BYOB.
