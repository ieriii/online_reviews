She's spacca'n napo-li, she's spacca'n napo-la... Sorry, this is what I hear when I hear the name of this place. I had zero expectations. I am not as familiar with Ravenswood as I should be, so when it comes to Ravenswood businesses, I'm a, little, "ruh roh, Shaggy!" But, I was in good hands. I was brought here by her Yelpiness, Ms. CC and she knows what she's doing. Spacca Napoli (you know you want to say it... napo-lay...) is a neapolitan pizza joint that does pizza the old-country way. I've never been to Italy, but Sofia Petrillo (RIP Estelle Getty) once told me to picture it and I've never let go of the image. If you enjoy your pizza wood-fired and not filled to the brim with ingredients (not a knock; just, you know how we Americans love our more more more...how do you like it, how do you like it?; I think I am channeling satellite radio), you'll love SN. Fortunately, we had a waiter who was quite informed of the menu. Between ten of us, we ordered 5 pizzas and we probably could have polished off a couple more. This is not to say that we're piggy piggersons; the pizzas are thin, smaller than what you'll get at the Hut and topped with only a few ingredients. Unless you're Fiona Apple, you probably won't get super full. For me, the standout pizza was the prosciutto, arugula and two cheese pizza (no red sauce). The spicy Italian sausage was pretty memorable as well. No comments from the peanut gallery, please. I wasn't as big of fan of the truffle oil/mushroom pizza, but that's my taste. A little truffle oil goes a long way. The rest of the table seemed to enjoy it. Finish the feast off with some Italian Peach Iced Tea and you're ready to rock. This might be my most useless, rambling review ever. Apologies. Eat guhd pizza here.
