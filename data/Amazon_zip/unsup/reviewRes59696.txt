We had a great dinner here. The steak was amazing. The staff was extremely friendly. They have a really good special currently: For $40 or $50, you get a salad, choice of a few steaks, choice of a side and a simple dessert.Our total bill for two with drinks including tip was almost $167. For us, that's a pretty big dinner bill. We still thought it was well worth it and would do it again on a special occasion or next trip to Chicago.We were a bit under dressed having just came down from a Cubs game at Wrigley. Perhaps that's why they sat us upstairs. Perhaps not.This was our first visit to a Ruth's Chris as we don't have one in our home town. It will not be the last!
