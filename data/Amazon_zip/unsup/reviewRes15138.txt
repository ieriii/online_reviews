I'm a little late to the party, as this was my first trip to Revolution. I was there for lunch with friends yesterday, and was looking forward to finally getting to go somewhere new, as I have been stuck in a rut lately. First of all, I love the decor! Awesome ceiling! But I was disappointed in the menu, too much tofu and vegan crap for me. So...I had a couple of Bloody Marys that weren't the best I've ever had, but certainly not the worst. Bacon Grease Popcorn=AWESOMENESS!!!!!!!!!! My burger=totally overcooked (I ordered it rare in the hopes of getting medium rare, but got medium). The fries, not so great. Salad was wonderful! The service was OK, not the best, not the worst. Overall, a middle of the road experience. I don't love it, I don't hate it.
