Nothing I can say will add any additional value to the reviews already posted here .... but Goddamn .... what a place!!! At first I waited for 1 hour and 30 mins in the blistering summer heat to get in and I was almost convinced that nothing could be worth that time and effort.  Boy was a wrong .... Doug is a genius, he has truly revolutionized the concept of a dog.  He has taken something that was street fare and made it gourmet .... and I bet he enjoyed doing it more than I enjoyed eating them. When I finally made it into the store, the menu was a shocker ... where else do you get foie gras and spicy alligator sausages?  Doug personally takes all the orders and his passion really comes across. I had 4 Dogs and an entire serving of Duck Fat Fries ..... I'm da man .... I really cannot wait to go there again .... Here's what I had : 1) Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage with Truffle Aioli, Foie Gras Mousse and Fleur de Sel. 2) Ribeye Steak Sausage with Black Garlic Aioli and Double Creme Brie Cheese 3) Caribbean Goat Sausage with Spicy Prickly Pear Creme Fraiche, Roasted Plantains and Delice du Jura Cheese 4) Wild Rice and Asiago Cheese Bison Sausage with Roasted Yellow Pepper Mustard and Chimay Beer Cheese My friend and I shared the : 4.5) Cherry and Apple Pork Sausage with Sweet Curry Mustard, Cocoa Cardona Cheese and Vodka-Infused Dried Fruit I cannot wait to go back in there ..... Oh yeah, something to keep in mind, this place is cash only .... no credit cards ...
