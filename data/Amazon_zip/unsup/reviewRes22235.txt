I love this place. The atmosphere is great. Saturday nights are car cruising nights and all the old cars drive in... But forgetting the great atmosphere---the dogs are great! We love the fries also. I hear the other food is great, but love the Superdawgs so much, I've never tried the other stuff. Maybe next time.
