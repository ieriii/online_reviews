On a recent trip to Chicago, I was absolutely dying to try Frontera, so it was my first stop after my boyfriend and I dropped our bags off at the hotel. After several futile attempts to make a reservation (or even get someone to answer the phone), I resigned myself to the fact that we would have to walk in at put our name on the list. We arrived at 9:15 and were quoted 2.5 hours, which was ridiculous, but I guessed it would be much shorter than that and we stayed (and I was right, we were seated around 10:30). We headed off to the bar, of course - Pacifico for him, margarita for me. The margarita was very good, but nothing to write home about. Once we were seated, we immediately placed an order for - what else? - guacamole. Wow - I loves me some guac and I'm kind of a snob about it, but this is fantastic. We followed it up with a ceviche trio, which was fresh and delicious. I ordered a glass of sangria (unbelievably good) to enjoy with my duck tacos, which could not have been more perfectly cooked and were wonderfully flavorful. Solid meal all around. Note on the service: the bartenders were very meh. After being forced to move to a different side of the bar after basically being shoulder-checked by a creepy guy who was trying to hit on two very drunk girls, the other bartender seemed less than thrilled to take our order for our second round, even suggesting that I walk back to the other side to talk to the original bartender. Our server Maria, however, was absolutely fantastic. She was friendly, attentive, and knew the menu cold.
