SERVICE: Excellent BYOB: Yes, and no corkage fee:) FOOD: Average. Seriously, it's merely average, and not as authentic as...let's say I Monelli or Pizza Art Cafe. PRICES: Insanely expensive. Seriously, the lasagna was good, but $20? Good (not great) food, excellent service & high prices = 3 Stars. I may return...
