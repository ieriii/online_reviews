I really enjoy Carnivale. The atmosphere is fun, the restaurant is absolutely huge and full of bright decor and the huge striped walls just add to the fun vibe in here. Not to mention the food is a hit too! I've been multiple times and have never been disappointed. The raspberry mojito is very refreshing and always made well. The fresh made guacamole is just that---very fresh and super tasty mixed with a perfect amount of tomato, onion and cilantro and the fresh chips are a bonus too! Every entree I've had (or eaten off of my fellow diner's plate) have been spiced well and is such an eclectic mix of flavors. My favorite is the pork, rice and fried plantains dish. The pork melts in your mouth and the sweetness of the plantain balances out the spices mixed in with the rice and beans. I've gone during the week and on a Saturday night and I would have to say if you're looking for a fun night out for dinner with friends or a date this is a great place to go. The lounge/bar area is very lively and they often have live music playing. I recommend making a reservation especially if you're going on the weekend. This is definitely a restaurant I would recommend and can't wait to go back to!
