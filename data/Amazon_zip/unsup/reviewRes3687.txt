I hate my friend Annie. You might ask why. She is one of my best friends. Well Annie introduced me to Crisp. I love Crisp. I don't live close to Crisp. Annie lives very close to Crisp and is able to go there often. I guess its a love hate relationship. Crisp is cheap, the service is friendly and the food is oh so fresh. I tried it and ate basically everything on the menu. LOVE the fried mushrooms as an appetizer with the dipping sauces. They are a must. I wanted lots of the traditional fried chicken, but I am so happy that we got the Seoul Sassy because it is delicious...well, sassy and...saucy! The Asian influence kicks in here. Order the Buddha Bowl veggies as a side - they're served cold but are addictive as are the cold potatoes (they are a bit sweet too). So full was my belly but so happy. Ok maybe I don't hate Annie for introducing me to this place, but maybe she can recommend a good gym for me and my happy tummy?
