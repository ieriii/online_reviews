With all these amazing reviews, what's there to say? Well, not much more to add other than this place is just amazing. The food was incredible. The gyro was so juicy and the sauce tangy and creamy. It was the best thing since sliced bread. The choco-peanut butter shake was enough to send my heart into palpitation overload. The best vegetarian/vegan place around. No doubt about this fact.
