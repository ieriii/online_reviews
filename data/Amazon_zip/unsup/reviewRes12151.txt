Well this place was just delightful. I came here tonight for dinner with Satan Trainer Rob (you all may know him as Rob L). When he suggested this place I have to be honest - I was a little wary, but he knows how picky I am so I trusted his judgment. And hot damn, I'm glad I did. I arrived a couple minutes before Rob, long enough to place a drink order at the bar. The bartender was really friendly, and when he discovered they were out of Skyy vodka to make the cosmo I had ordered he gave me some other options. I went with the Grey Goose, and he poured my glass so full I might have spilled it. Oops. I took a sip and damn, that was strong. Nice. He then told me he would bring my tab to our table so we could go ahead and get seated. Cool. Rob and I took our seats, and perused the menu. I left the appetizers up to him, and he selected the Taste of Cuba. While we waited, we chatted and noshed on the bread with the super yummy butter - don't pass this up. When the apps arrived, I was all, "what's that?" and Rob encouraged me to try everything - so I sampled one of each and it was all good, but I'm glad it was an appetizer because none of it was something I would make a meal out of. Our food came out just as we finished the apps - I ordered the Carne a la Parilla (skirt steak) and... well, I have no idea what Rob had. And before I could even pay attention to what he had, his plate was clean. But my skirt steak was absolutely delicious! It had a really nice flavor to it, and my mouth had a nice heat happening but it was never overwhelming. Rob ordered a side of plantains, which I had never had before (yes, I live in a cave), and they were pretty awesome. Stuffed, we both passed on dessert but they have a pretty decent menu if you're in the mood for it. The service was fantastic all night, and the water refills were plentiful. Color me happy. Seriously, why does North Center have all the good restaurants?
