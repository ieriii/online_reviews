Originally went here when it first opened and came back about 2 weeks ago with a bunch of friends. I really feel that the food quality has gone down. We tried multiple types of ceviche and guacamole for appetizers. All were okay but a little pricey. I had the tuna entree which was on the bland side. I nibbled on multiple different entrees and again quality was average at best. One of my friends had a birthday so they brought out a birthday dessert but charged for it. I felt they were nickel and diming us because we easily spent over $500 yet got charged for a birthday dessert. The menu prices probably have not changed since I first came here but quality seems to have gone down hill. For the $$$ we spent, we easily could have found a better meal.
