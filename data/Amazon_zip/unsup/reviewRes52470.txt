It's hard to review a place that has so many reviews already. It's intimidating, to say the least. Why read my review? Why not that of others? Temptations says give it One star then the a great review, just to mix it up. Common sense says don't be an ass. A Churrascaria is a Brazilian or Portuguese steakhouse. Brazzaz is such a place. The format is this: You get your table and sit, and small noshes are brought to your table (Typically palette cutting items like bread, or fried bananas). You enjoy a well crafted soup, salad and small plate island before returning to your seat, and ordering one of their many vintages. Then you flip a small plastic medallion over to its green side, and wait. Before long, a handsome young man appears tableside holding a skewer of meat, one of many varieties that have been prepared for the meal. At your discretion he slices off a portion and you accept it onto your plate, and he slides on to the next table. This is AWESOME. Being a meat lover, I can say the meat served is the best I've ever had. Delicious, tender, flavour filled cuts of lamb, sirloin, filet, chicken...even roasted pineapple, sweet and sour and succulent. Brazzaz is always full, so shoot for a reservation. I'd say it's an excellent place for a big date. Not the first date, mind you, but maybe the third. Expect to take a taxi (Not worth parking), expect to spend a little (50 bucks a head, plus wine and tip), expect to enjoy yourself. My advice would be to use this as a pre/endcap to a night out at the theatre or the like. Enjoy yourself.
