Upon my first visit to the Windy City, my friends told me I had to try Giordano's. Being that deep dish pizza originated from Chicago, I had high expectations. Man, I really hope this isn't the best that Chicago has to offer. I'm from California, and I can name at least 3 deep dish places that have better pizza than Giordano's. The pizza was way, way, way too cheesy...just smothered in cheese. It was good cheese, but I mean that's all I could taste in the pizza! The crust was crispy and thick, which is good because I really do appreciate a good hearty crust on a pizza. We also ordered the bruschetta, which was piled on with tomatoes and onion, on tiny pieces of bread. It was okay, but I've had better bruschetta from my oven at home! Unfortunately, my expectations for Giordano's was built up too high, and I was let down. =(
