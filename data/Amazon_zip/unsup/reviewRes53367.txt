This is high art gastronomy. An experience, not just sustenance.Service impeccable. Each dish perfection. Atmosphere is as you would expect for the now 3 Michelin starred restaurant. Not as fussy as I thought it would be, but still a little stiff. Not a major criticism. More a personal preference for something a little more casual and laidback. But hey, this is one of the best restaurants in the world, and people expect certain airs and graces.A major highlight for me was the dessert served at, or should I say, on, the table. Performance and flavour was sweeeet.Oh, and save your pennies for this one. As you can expect, a once in a lifetime meal comes with a once in a lifetime price tag.
