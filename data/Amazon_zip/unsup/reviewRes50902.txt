Delicious! My husband and I stumbled across this place for lunch because we were in the area, and we were pleasantly surprised. Mac n cheese - delicious - probably could have eaten a plate full! Also had the sauteed spinach which was also delicious - it came barely wilted with a lovely lemon flavor. The salmon cakes looked small, but were so dense that we could barely finish them. Service was really good - he refilled our water 3 times and made sure to come back to see how everything was going.  We will be back.
