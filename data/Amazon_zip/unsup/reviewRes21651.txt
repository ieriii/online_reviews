So good!  Went there a few weeks ago right at 5 to avoid any lines and was able to order and sit right away. We tried the ahogada (drowned?) sandwich, and it was mighty tasty. The vermicilli soup was also delicious, so much so that I finished it all, even though the spiciness made my nose run and my eyes water throughout every tasty bite. I won't even talk about the churros, you have to try them for yourself, and you will not be disappointed - promise! Get the ice cream to dip for sure! And the hot chocolate was yummy as well, unlike any I've ever had. Try it for yourself, it's definitely an acquired taste but one I'm glad I have! :)
