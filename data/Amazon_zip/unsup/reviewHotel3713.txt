This Hotel service and staff is hands down UNMATCHED. I met a friend in the city that I hadn't seen in some time. After we shopped and ate it was very late and while we both live in the suburbs we decided to get a room in the city and continue the fun. She suggested the Drake having been there for the tea room only days before..and while I could care less about the tea room I wanted a High End upscale room for the night. First of all this Hotel is Dated, it reminded me of "old Chicago" almost as if you stepped back in time. These staff members and servers were beyond friendly and helpful to her and I. Our room was right around 300 for the night and honestly worth every cent. King sized bed two beautiful bathrooms and elite room service. Alot of wannabe hotels claim to be classy and yet their staff shows otherwise. I plan on going back and staying for fun in the future. Well worth the money.
