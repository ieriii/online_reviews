The best Carne asada tacos I have ever had, Really delicious, and for Tom who gave t one star, This couldn't be the same place, They never would have had you wait to clear a table, because THERE ARE NO TABLES, I also love the Chile Rellenos and the Orchata,  the pictures f the hottie latina news anchors, and trying to understand the little Spanish signs they have all over behind the grill.
