Went to this place last night with friends, and none of us were very impressed. Here is our list of grievances: 1. Has this place been redecorated (or cleaned) since the 70s? While taking in the surroundings after we were seated, I noticed crayon scribbles on the stucco walls. Nice. 2. Our waitress, although she was nice I guess, had no skills.  She took our order, delivered our food, and brought the bill. Those are the only times we saw her. Forget refills- that apparently was not an option. 3. I ordered buffalo chicken strips. Absolutely disgusting. Dis-gust-ing. The homemade chips were good, but due to the fact that they piled my buffalo strips on top of them and poured their sucky buffalo sauce all over the entire plate, I couldn't enjoy many of the homemade chips that were below the chicken.  4. Apparently they don't serve french fries anymore. Who the hell doesn't serve french fries? And, even better, when my friend asked the aforementioned waitress if we could order a side of fries, she informed us that they no longer serve fries, but she could "totally bring a side of vegetables". What is she implying? No french fries for you fat-ass, but I'll bring you some broccoli! 5. Tip: If you order a water, ask for a normal sized glass. Otherwise, you'll be drinking out of a glass that is so small it might as well be a sippy cup. Overall, it wasn't terrible, but I definitely don't see what all the fuss is about. I wouldn't go out of my way to go there again.
