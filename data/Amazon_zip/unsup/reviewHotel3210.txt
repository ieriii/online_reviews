so after the thrill of seeing some of the museum aspects of the hotel...jimi hendrix's outfit...you are done...the rooms are ok...i saw some janky furniture that should have been replaced...when you can tell that the desk is made of partical board covered with laminate because the laminate has peeled off...that's bad...
