Love the feel of this place! For some reason it reminds me of a lodge, but with more complexity. Enclosed booths line the walls, long wooden tables at the center, tall bar tables, and counter seats ... your choice! We had reservations at 11:30 on a sunday and the place was full! - spicy pork rinds $7 ... not the kind that come out of the bag, probably the best pork rinds you could have.  -publican bacon, maple syrup braised $7 ... sooo thick it's more like slabs of pork than bacon really ... but good. This is not your thick cut crispy bacon ... this is charred, thick, meaty, and definitely fatty bacon! -red wine poached eggs, la quercia prosciutto, sourdough, and bearnaise $11 ... the poached eggs were cooked perfectly and you could taste the faintness of the red wine. This dish was perfect for brunch! -scrapple, fried egg, and sourdough $10 ... the scrapple was thick, large, and heavy! Not my first choice, but it was good and had a very distinct taste to it that is worth a try.
