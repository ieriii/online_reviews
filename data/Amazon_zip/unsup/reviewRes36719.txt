I'm writing this review for delivery thai only. I was lonely one night, wanted some thai food without having to put on pants (plan foiled when I needed to go answer the door), so I found this place on grubhub. Someone mentioned the crab rangoons already, but I must support this view: the crab rangoons are FANTASTIC. Starch to filling ratio was optimal, and flavoring was perfect. My main dish was the pad see eew, my normal comparison dish. I was impressed with the taste, texture, and amount of vegetables included. Instead of the mush you normally get crammed into the corners of the carton as an afterthought, the vegetables were actually there as a major player in the dish. Chicken was also excellent, not having the little chewy bits you inevitable find in most chinese or thai chicken dishes. Delivery was prompt, and the food was packaged elegantly. Nothing special, but nice paper sack instead of the usual plastic grocery bag dripping brown sauce on the carpet, and nice containers which made for great reheating. Presentation was nice enough for ordering in on a date if you and your significant other are also against putting on pants. Alas, all this comes at a price. Crab rangoon (not terribly large portions), chicken pad see eew and delivery charge put me in the $16 range. It was enough for dinner and a late night snack later, but I would recommend bringing some friends to dilute the delivery charge and to score one of their numerous grubhub coupons (free appetizers for $20 order, etc). Great place if you're willing to pay. Now one of these days I shall don pants and go to the actual location (no pants, no service?)
