There's nothing bad I can say about the food. Everything we ate and tried was delicious, and I'll always love BYOB. I really wish, though, I had a better experience with the service. Granted, we could have hit an off night, but I was not happy. Here's cautionary tale: We were seated and ordered pretty promptly. Unfortunately, our food did not return to us so quickly. After 45 minutes, then and hour of waiting, with explanation after explanation that the kitchen is backed up and our food was coming, we were getting annoyed. It was relatively empty when we got there and ordered, so what was the hold up?! More so, tables that were seated and ordered well after us received their food long before us. One table was even seated, served, and left in the time we waited for our food. When our food finally arrived approximately an hour and 20 minutes after we ordered, the explanation we received again was that the kitchen was backed up. To borrow from Cheri Oteri doing Judge Judy, "Don't pee on my leg and tell me it's raining!" If the kitchen was so backed up, then tables around us that ordered after us (at least 4 different tables) should not have been served their full meals (appetizers and entrees) before us. If you lose a ticket, just admit it. We would have totally been fine with an honest explanation since the ambiance on the back patio is really pleasant. It's the lying, dancing around reality, and especially the watching our waiter avoid us like the plague when he knew we were upset that's truly annoying. For all the trouble we had, I definitely considered giving them two stars, but the food was very good and we were offered a significantly discounted bill (or free round of desserts,our choice) for all our troubles. So the management redeemed themselves a bit and deserve the extra 3rd star. Long story short, I'll go back. But if I have another service experience like this one, 90 Miles will definitely lose this Cuban-food Lover's business.
