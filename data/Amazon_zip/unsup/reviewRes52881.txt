No, i won't repeat all the raves, won't replicate all the capital letters, won't even add my own cross-cultural commentary. this is just simply a very inexpensive clean authentic accessible and pleasant place for Cuban food. One correction, tho. there are a few reviews that identify Ropa Viejo as shredded pork - it is shredded beef. LECHON is pork. and their empanadas (i have veggie) are excellent.  i made three meals out of one dinner with one side ....
