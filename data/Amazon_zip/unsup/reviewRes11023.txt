Be aware that it has tight quarters even on a weekday. I liked the way the restaurant looked otherwise, but can't even imagine weekend brunches. It is definitely overrated. The food was uninspiring, burnt, and cold.  I will not be returning here. There are better options for breakfast/brunch at a much lower price.
