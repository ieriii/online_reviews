This place is in my Top 3 best places to get REAL pizza, East Coast style pizza. Not this garbage that Chicago pizza lovers eat. (Squares, cracker crust, deep dish... That's NOT pizza) Though, sometimes with this place, the pizza the you receive via delivery is sub-par. Eating inside this place can be annoying sometimes also... With the "hipster" waitresses that are not very good at thier JOB... but, expect you to chase them down for everything. And, I think you have to have about 80% of your body covered with tattoos to work here... Oh and deadlocks are encouraged... Most of them look like they are homeless... I'm glad this has no effect on the qulaity of the pizza... Because, the pizza is really good... Just don't go there on Sat nights... You''ll reget seeing and hearing the way too loud karaoke...
