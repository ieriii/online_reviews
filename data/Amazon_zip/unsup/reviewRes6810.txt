Really cool vibe - unpretentious and about as laid back as you would want an "upscale BBQ" joint to be. We were sat up front by a fire place (perfectly toasty on a chilly Chicago night) and pretty close to a television showing sports highlights. Probably could have done without the television, but again, I don't think they are trying to be overly fancy. It works. One thing that bothered us a little was the closeness of the tables up front. We had two people at a four person high top table and the two extra chairs were continually being bumped into and fumbled with. I've read a few times that the food comes very quickly, and I'll admit that it was a bit of a turnoff at first. I'm not sure why, though. Maybe the old "holy smokes, they must have had this sitting back there waiting on the next idiot to order!" concern. Regardless, the baby back ribs were cooked just right - falling off the bone like you read about - and the pulled chicken sandwich wasn't dry at all. Mixed with the right combination of sauces that are brought to the table, you can have yourself a great barbecue meal. I was happy and I was full. Quick tip - don't be afraid to try the sweet pickles they put on every table. They'll knock your socks off.
