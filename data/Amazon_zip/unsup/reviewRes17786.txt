We made a reservation at 9 on a Friday for Carnivale and showed up around 8:45. The hostess then told us that we would not be seated until around 9:20. Ummm... what's the point of making a reservation if i still have to wait for 35 minutes for a table? That gave me a bad feeling about the place but they ended up seating us a lot closer to 9 so I'm not sure what that was all about. The place is beautifully decorated with fun bright colors. The food was delicious. I had the arepa appetizer and skirt steak. The mojtios are also fantastic. I would definitely recommend it but you have to make a reservation as the waiting area was packed even at 9 oclock.
