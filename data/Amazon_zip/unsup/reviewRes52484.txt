I'll be brief here since so many others have hit the high points: The wife and I shared our first anniversary here, and we couldn't have left happier... or more stuffed for that matter. Buyer beware... Go in to this place with a plan of attack. Simply put, the ambiance, decor, salad bar, skewered meats, and desserts are all top quality. Everyone is friendly. I was truly surprised to hear if there was something you didn't get during the walk arounds, or if you loved something in particular, they gladly special order you up a swords worth. Not that the wife and i did this, but man, how nice to know. The salad bar had an amazing array of sushi, pasta salads, cured meats, and a hot bar with huge meat balls, tri-color tortellini, grilled veggies, and mushroom risotto. Upon flipping the coin to orange or "bring on the meat parade!" they bring you mashed potatoes, rice and beans, and fried bananas. We sampled 14 different meats. From the juicy bottom round, to the smokey grilled shrimp... everything was succulent and wonderful. Add alongside it fresh grilled pineapple, and well, you can understand why you should come to dine "with a plan". We took our time, and did end up getting a nice banana creme brulee on which they wrote "Happy Anniversary" in chocolate. Like I said... from the staff to the food to the decor, the evening was simply perfect. Heck, even the valet was only 11.75, which all things considered isn't bad at all. The meal with tax, tip, dessert, a glass of wine and dessert coffee did add up... but hey, this isn't an "every week" type place. So, all things considered, we ate like a king and queen and were treated as such. Kudos to the staff. We'll be back. When our waistlines and wallets reconfigure. :)
