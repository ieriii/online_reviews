This is my all time favorite Pho noodle restaurant! All their ingredients are extremely fresh. The atmosphere and service is lacking, but the great food makes up for it. I used to try to order delivery from here, but about 75% of the time they would tell me they didn't have a delivery person that day, so I just gave up.
