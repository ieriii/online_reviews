We found this great restaurant while staying at the Blackstone Reinassance in Chicago. They recommended it during check-in at the hotel. Even though we were still early for lunch, they accommodated us and showed us the Lunch menu. The service was great. The decor was impressive and the food was delicious. Great tapas and varied selection. Portions where kind of small, but then again, they were tapas. Croquetas de Bacalo were superb. I ordered the scallops with eggplant and they were fabulous. Next morning we had breakfast here. The BEST Eggs Benedict I've ever had!!!! Congratulations to the Chef!! At night it has a great crowd with two available bars. A must.
