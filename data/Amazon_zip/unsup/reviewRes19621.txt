So I wondered if the owner even knew what Xoco meant, where the term came from and how it has influenced millenniums of languages from Mayan to Aztec to Tlahuica, Catalan, and English. Now admittedly, having lived and worked in Mexico for a couple of years, I am quick to disregard the typical "authentic Mexican food" slogan that is all too often splashed across the tackily-lit restaurant signs of Mexican restaurants. Of course, being in the loop, and on this celebratory Saturday, the sign was nil, as would be expected, and the slogan MIA. With all the ranting and raving of Chicago's best Mexican cuisine chef , who is not Mexican BTW, still left me questioning--can he really be that good??? As we waited in line for 45 minutes to place our order and be seated I smart-assedly (sp.) decided to test my theory and pick one of the most authentic Mexican food items I could find, cochinita pibil. As you may have noticed, I already began the process of self-deprecation because what I got this perfect, celebratory, luck-filled, joyous Saturday afternoon was nothing other than true, exquisite, Mexican-style roasted pork with achiote, laden with perfectly pickled red onions--just as you would find in Central Mexico. The preparation was so perfect I did away with the bread and enjoyed the savory roasted flavor of my cochinita pibil. I don't think we could have followed up the dyeing of the Chicago River with a more perfect lunch than the one we had at Xoco. I have every intention of returning to Xoco to try the Jalisco-region famed Torta Ahogada, which I've had only once but made a lasting impression on me. I can't wait to work my way down the menu..... Provecho!
