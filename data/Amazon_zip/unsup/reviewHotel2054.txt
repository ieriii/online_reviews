The best part about our room was the view. Other than that, it was a little run-down. If I had been staying for pleasure rather than business I would definitely have complained and/or requested a different room, but I just didn't have the time to deal with it.  Although I'm pretty picky about cleanliness, I think even some basic things were ignored. The light switch in the bathroom was COVERED in grime and a layer of dust on top. The bathroom sink was an undermount, and there was a ring of mold around the entire sink under the lip of the sink. Ew. Toilet wasn't cleaned thoroughly. Ew. The towels seemed old, and scratchy.  We were across from a housekeeping/laundry room where there always seemed to be several employees hanging out talking LOUDLY to each another. Although the sound-proofing between rooms seems good, the sound from the hallway travels directly through the door. It was like they were actually in the room with us. Really annoying. The bed was comfortable but the pillows were not, despite their "pillow menu." It's been a couple weeks since my stay and I still have a crick in my neck. I think the bedding was fairly new, but it already looked worn. Overall I don't know if I'd stay here again. The tip-able staff was nice, but the front desk folks were pretty morose. And despite the renovation, the rooms were still shabby, just with new TVs and a pillow menu.
