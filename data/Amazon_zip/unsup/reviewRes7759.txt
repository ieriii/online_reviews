Please note that I'm commenting on the "salad bar only" option! As a vegan, I have no interest in the all-you-can-eat meat. However, I've had the opportunity to try the extensive salad bar a couple times while dining with meat-eating co-workers and friends. It is not your average salad bar. It is overflowing with fresh vegetables and "fancy" things like asparagus, artichoke hearts and hearts of palm. There are numerous types of olives and seeds to go on top. Fresh bread and olive oil help fill you up. However, I just can't justify paying about $30 for salad. Even if I absolutely stuff myself, I'm hungry an hour later. I can understand the meat option being as expensive as it is; however, they should really reconsider how much they charge for the "salad bar only" option.
