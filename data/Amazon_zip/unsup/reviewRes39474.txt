I've been coming here to eat since I was in high school. They're open really late and are always pretty busy. If you come in groups of 10 or larger, you can make reservations. Most likely you will be sat in areas which require you to sit on the floor, Asian style. Food is plentiful, although they have been tending to kinda skimp a bit on the side dishes. Tons and tons of meat. Like any Korean restaurant, the service is lacking, but it's Korean style: flag down a waitress or a helping hand as the need for anything comes up. You leave smelling like the food you ate, which is pretty cute for the saying "You are what you eat." The lot is ridiculously tiny, so be prepared to have a bit of help getting in/out of the lot or finding available parking in the residential area.
