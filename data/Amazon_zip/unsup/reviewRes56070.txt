I have been going to Superdawg ever since I was a little girl. Every time I go to Superdawg I will always get a Whoopercheesie with basically everything. Superdawg is a great drive in restaurant to go eat at night because you can go with your car and just eat in there or you can go sit out at the tables and just eat with friends and enjoy the night. I was hanging out with my boyfriend one night and I was in the mood to eat a Whoopercheesie with fries at Superdawg. When we went there that night that was his first time there and ever since that night he loves that place and he always wants to go there for a hot dog or a Whoopercheesie instead of going to Burger King and McDonald's late at night. Their service is great their so polite and they don't take forever to make your food. Also if there is room in your tummy after their sundaes are also AMAZING!!
