It doesn't remind you so much of an Italian restaurant as much as an actual restaurant in Italy. One of those small tratorias where you walk in and the chairs don't quite match and the interior is a little rustic but the food is incredible and in season. They are extremely creative and the menu changes frequently for new foodie adventures while they also keep the crowd favorites on the menu. Try the lemon panna cotta.
