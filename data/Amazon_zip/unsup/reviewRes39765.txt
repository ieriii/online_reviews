I've been eager to dine here after drinking at the bar one night and smelling the delicious aromas of animals from all walks of life cooked in butter. It got worse when my friends went here WITHOUT ME and were raving all about it. Therefore, I pressured my gentleman caller into bringing me here for a designated date night yesterday evening because I wasn't going to be happy until I ate something pretentious and expensive. This place felt like something out of a TV show about city life. Waiting in line on a Thursday night in a dark, purposely distressed-looking space in the latest up-and-coming neighborhood while urban professionals, lesbians and bald gentlemen in suits dined on their perfectly plated meat candies. Now I'm just rambling. Anyyyyways. After finally being seated, and reading a whole bunch of words I don't recognize (i.e. Zabuton), we just go with two things that our server says are good. Why not? When am I ever going to purposely order bone marrow again? Shit. We had the veal and the Zabuton. It was tastey. I liked it. My point is I think you should come here, but it's just one of those "hey, let's get gussied up and pretend we go to places like this" one-time deals. Not one of those places you CRAVE. Like Jerry's or Manee Thai. Longman and Eagle is an experience. An interesting one at that. Because as you digest, you keep remembering all of the meat you ate. And how your morning breath tasted and smelled. Enjoy!
