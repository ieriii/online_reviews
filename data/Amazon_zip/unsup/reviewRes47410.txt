Went here because I heard they have great burgers, I would have given this place a higher rating if it weren't for the service being so HORRIBLE, The burger was really good and I"m sad I won't be back to try another one. I don't know if there was just one server on or what because all this girl did was take our order after we sat there for ten minutes wondering if she was ever going to come to our table, well she did that to every table. The guy who brought our food out for us also brought us silverware, check and anything else we needed. I don't know why she waits ten minutes before approaching a table but being a server myself in those ten minutes she might be giving a table to look over the menu she could be getting them drinks. Once we finished eating the guy who was doing all her work cleared our table, we then sat there for 20 minutes with nothing on our table waiting to see how long it would take her to realize we were done and wanted the check, then another ten minutes before we were able to leave. All in that time I saw her galley lagging with people. Would have given this place 1 one star but the burger was really good so I added a star, as for Katie, I don't think serving is the right job for you.
