Went here with a group of 6 for a friend's birthday party. It's really cute and quaint with dim lighting and Italian waiters dressed in jeans and tight black tops. I called ahead for a reservation, not thinking I would need one on a Wednesday, but was glad I made one since it got pretty crowded and is fairly small. It's BYOB with no corking fee, so that's a plus. However, their menu was fairly pricey so they may compensate for not selling booze that with higher prices. We all got different things and agreed that the best were the baked eggplant and the special, which was a stuffed gnocchi with pesto and cheese, topped with a tomato cream sauce. My friend got that and it was seriously cute fluffy little pillows on a plate and tasted sooo good! The sauce can make or break your dinner so ask about the sauce. One of my friend's dinners was ruined because her dinner was drowning in cream, while my pasta carbonara had no sauce at all. The portions were huge though, and everyone had leftovers for the next day. They brought out some chocolate cake for my friend's birthday (after we had ordered it) and can't remember if we were charged for that. If you have a group of 6 or more, 18% gratuity is automatically added. Service was fair. Would go back if it were closer to where I live!
