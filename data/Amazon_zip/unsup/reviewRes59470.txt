When our neighborhood restaurant closed, we were looking for a new place to enjoy some good Italian food. Our friend, Chris, became a waiter at LaVilla and suggested we try out the place. We have now become Thursday night regulars and besides always enjoying great food, we have gotten to know their staff. From their hostess, Gwen, to our favorite waiter, Chris, to the busboy, Roberto, and to the bartender, Jose, we are always greeted warmly and assured of great cocktails, wonderful pastas, pizza, steaks and chicken dinners. It's the next best place to having dinner at home!
