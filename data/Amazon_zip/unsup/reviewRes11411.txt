This place was great! I went there at around 11:30 am on a Thursday. We were thrilled to see that they were still serving breakfast despite the fact that it was a weekday. The service was good & quick. I ordered the vegetarian egg croissant sandwich. It was deeeeelicious! It had all sort of delicious veggies- sprouts, cucumbers, basil mayo, tomato. Oh man it was so good. The breakfast potatoes were pretty good too. It was a wee bit pricey for brunch but the food was definitely worth it! I saw a guy next to me with banana oreo pancakes and I was sorry I couldn't try those too. Yum.
