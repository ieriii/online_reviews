We arrived at about 5:15 or 5:30 pm on a Thursday night. A bit early for dinner, but we were eating before going to a play. Good timing, because by the time we were finished and were heading out, the place was packed and plenty of people were waiting. This place gets busy, be warned, but never fear! I had never heard of this place so it was a complete surprise to me. The staff was wearing street clothes, not uniforms, Totally not pretentious at all, I dig it! We ordered the ricotta with honey appetizer (yum!), the grilled asparagus, the ragu of the day poured over some creamy mascarpone polenta (so delicious!), we also had the leek and mushroom pizza with truffle oil(more please!) we had the rigatoni with sausage(great) and a chicken dish which was just okay. Regretfully we were too stuffed for dessert. The food was really great and the small plates were great as there are so many things to try. I will definitely come back some time. It was a great surprise, having never heard of the place before! Worth checking out.
