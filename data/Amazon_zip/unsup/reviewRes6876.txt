I love this place. The location is perfect, the atmosphere is great, and the food is amazing. I'd give it 5 stars but our service was not great. I've been here twice. We went again last night for the small plates. That was insanely delicious. We had the avocado crostini (unreal), rigatoni caprese, mushroom risotto, shortribs and veal meatballs. All delicious and perfect portions. We had the tiramisu for dessert. Utter perfection. Our waiter was really slow and inattentive. He seemed like a nice guy, he just sort of went through the motions and we kept having to ask for things. He didn't give us the tapas menu at first either, and at first seemed like he had no idea what we were asking for... We will be back for sure. Hopefully next time we just get a different waiter!
