A two night business stay was pleasant and I had everything I needed. Clean room with all appliances. Mini bar was very expensive ($9 for a small can of Heineken!), but that goes for most hotels now. The hotel 'navigation' computer display was completely useless as it kept crashing, so I unplugged it. I won't let that minor gripe spoil the 4 stars rating though. Makes a great base for exploring Chicago.
