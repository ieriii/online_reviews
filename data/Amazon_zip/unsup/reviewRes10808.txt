Always a favorite brunch spot! The key is to go right when they open at 9 am in order not to have to wait. We always get a savory and a sweet dish to share and they NEVER disappoint :) Savory recommendations - blt benedict, breakfast burrito that has sweet potatoes in it and ultimate favorite - veggie sandwich that I ask them to put some bacon on. I am very disappointed that they got rid of the tea smoked duck benedict - that was probably my favorite brunch dish in the city - please bring it back! Sweet recommendations - pancakes with pretzel chunks, red velvet hotcakes and anything that has cream anglaise on it :) Everything is absolutely fantastic! Please do not come here and order scrambled eggs and toast because you will have food envy from the rest of the towers and mounds of beautiful food! Service and coffee refills are always top notch. We love Pearl as our waitress!!! Only suggestion - please change your breakfast potatoes to be a little bit more flavorful...
