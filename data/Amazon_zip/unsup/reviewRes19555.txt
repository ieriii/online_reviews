I know, I know, there's over 200 reviews for Coast, why bother reviewing it? But, I have to, since I'm not sure why there's so much hating going on. I mean, it's reasonably priced delicious sushi AND BYOB. Who can argue with that? Personally, I've always enjoyed Coast. Last time I was there, I tried two regular makis-- dragon and spider and two signature ones--po' boy and coast crab. The soft shell crab in the spider was really meaty and although it was a bit larger than what I normally like in a roll, I think that I enjoyed the po'boy the best--maybe because it contained cream cheese, avocado, and tempura crumbs. Spicy, sweet, and super tasty.
