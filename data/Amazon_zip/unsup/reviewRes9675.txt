Absolutely no complaints. Spot on food and great atmosphere! Chef Dale is rocking it out over at Sprout, if you haven't checked it out, whatcha waiting for?? The menu changes, so I'd hate to reccomend a specific dish, just now it's all good...I've yet to taste a dish that I didn't find pleasing...they've won many kudos for the cheese "sandwich" served as an intermezzo, and a true must-try item!
