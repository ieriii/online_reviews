Jennifer K., I don't care whatsoever about Facebook and and I certainly don't need to be blasted with Hyatt Regency ads the rest of my life to get some stupid deal of the week.  If Starbucks can provide free wifi with the purchase of a $1.95 cup of coffee, why can't the Hyatt provide it when folks are paying $195.00+ per night for a hotel room? AND my friends who did pay for wifi said it was extremely slow and not worth the cost. I recommend that you hire some consultants and get your network working properly. There are tons of hotels in Chicago that are right within the vicinity, for example, the Sheraton, Radisson, Fairmont, W, Westin, Marriott, etc. It is a huge assumption on your part that I would ever stay at this Hyatt again, so, thanks but no thanks for seeing you for some special deal.
