The Green Mill.... This place is an unpretentious place for Jazz. It's dark and narrow and always jam packed. I've been there 10+ times, but never ever sat down for a performance as the seating is very limited and the place always fills up pretty early.  The atmosphere, although historic since Al Capone used to come here, is just okay to me. It's a bit too dark, narrow and a bit run down, but it's all about the music and it's good here. The Uptown location can be a bit seedy after dark, but the neighborhood is slowly gentrifying. The crowd is surprisingly young for Jazz, but in Chicago, everyone seems to love jazz. If you're more about the music and less about the swanky jazz club environment, this is the place to go.
