I'm not sure where all these bad reviews came from, but my one and only Publican experience was excellent. The pork rinds were an excellent, surprisingly light starter, a smoked trout dish was a unique second course, and the pork chops we had for a main were without a doubt the best I've ever had. The beers were similarly strong; nothing particularly unique, but a good (if pricey) selection. The ambiance was a perfect match for the food; a single large, loud, well-lit room, with seating at long communal tables, tall tables for two, or booths for larger groups. The next time I'm in Chicago, I certainly hope to make a return visit!
