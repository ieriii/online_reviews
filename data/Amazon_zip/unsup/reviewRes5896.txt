Well it's about time I reviewed the place that has my most favorite martini in the world! That's right folks, the Key Lime Pie martini at Wildfire is to die for. It's possible that the one in Red Square in Vegas is better but I haven't been back to compare so this fills my number one slot. I always try a KLP martini anytime I see one on a menu and haven't found one better yet, so trust me on this one. I know my KLP martinis! They have a martini flight too which I tried on my birthday last year after already having a couple Key Lime Pies so it's a wonder I even remember dinner. Anyway, you are probably not as crazy about martinis as I am so let's talk about the food. First off it's a sin to eat here and not have their chopped salad. It's amazing. I never knew salad could be so good. Try it. Then of course there is the reason everyone comes here - the meat. The steak is great especially when you get it with one of their specialty crusts. Not much else to say really. Oh wait, yes there is. Say it with me everyone, KEY LIME PIE MARTINI!
