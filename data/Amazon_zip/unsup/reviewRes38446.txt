This pizza is truly stuffed. You have to be in the mood for lots of cheese and ready to wait about 45 minutes for your pizza so plan ahead. Their turkey sandwich and side salad are also good if you're in the mood for something other than pizza. The sandwich bread was fantastic (crusty on the outside and chewy on the inside). Good luck finding parking!
