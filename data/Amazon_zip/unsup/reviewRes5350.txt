Who doesn't wake up with the shakes, craving some good ole pig ear? Finally, the Purple Pig is here to fulfill this rampant addiction. It cunningly manages to stay off the beaten path, while being smack dab on the magnificent mile. Like many of its peers, it too hails the pork-brussel sprout-marrow bandwagon. But it does so flawlessly. And cheaply. So I'm sold. Their brussels are shaved and manscaped, a fun twist. The beets and goat cheese is a treat, the richest $5 you'll spend. The cheeses are a must. The pork neck bone rillete smear was divine. Even though there's a good chance it was dog meat, so be it. The octopus sealed the deal.  Overall the perfect place for wine and indulging in the nuances of the pig anatomy, among many other things. For two, the wait ain't bad, even on a weekend. At least for now.
