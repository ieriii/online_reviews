Easily my favorite pizza in all of Chicago. The bar is nice, and they have a great lunch special that includes a small pizza and a beer. How can you beat that? It is hard to get to by public transit, so I usually drive, and parking is ok in the area. When I get it delivered, they usually arrive within an hour and the pizza is always still hot.
