I love Chicago! I cannot wait to go back and explore some more of this great city. I have to thank my job for sending me to Chicago this past May for an employee recognition trip. This was a great experience and i really happy i was able to share it with Meesh. We got there a day early to get the exploring started early. The Fairmont from day 1 impressed me. The service was top notch and the staff always had a smile on their faces. Always eager to help and make our stay more enjoyable. I felt like a little kid as we walked in the room. The bed was humungous and comfy as hell. Beautiful bathrooms and a sweet view plus they put us on the 20th floor so we could take advantage the view. We were there for a few days and soaked up the hotel and the city. Its located right in the middle by Millennium Park and everything is but a short cab ride away. Quick tip - walk around the block and check the Noodle place. Freaking delicious. We found it the last day there. Epic fail. if not, we would have been noodled out. Will i stay here again. If the price is right then yes. It can get a bit pricey but since my job was paying i was not worrying about the bill. Where to next ? travel buddy/girlfriend/adventurer Meesh Adventure is out there!
