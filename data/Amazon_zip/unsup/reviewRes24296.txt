Good food, excellent service. My compatriot and I arrived at 9am on a Sunday morning and were immediately seated in one of 3 booths by the windows. I give big kudos because they had large cucumber slices floating in the table water. Normally, I think it environmentally irresponsible when a restaurant brings you water without first asking if you want it, but for CUCUMBER water I will let it slide. So, so refreshing, and the busser was crazy-efficient about refilling our glasses. I would literally take one sip and he would come around with the pitcher. My friend had the Nutella and banana crepes which she really enjoyed. I liked them, they were good, but I was in the mood for something savory, so I can't really rave about them. I had the cream cheese and salmon crepes and they were di-freakin'-vine. It was not lox, the salmon was fully cooked, and I could have had them with goat cheese instead of the cream cheese. There was a delightful sauce in there which I can't place, but it was a full palate feeling of satisfaction. 5 stars for those. We shared an order of apricot and brie crepe which was okay. It was not at all warm and the brie wasn't that great. It tasted like a cold pancake with jelly and cheese. I was impressed that they split the normally single large crepe into 2 separate smaller crepes on 2 plates for us WITH the full servings of fruit and fried potatoes on each. The restaurant was clean with the exception of the sides of the table tops. I know, it seems picky, but that part of our table was gooky. I will go back. There are, like, 30 crepe varieties to try and I'm aimin' for them all.
