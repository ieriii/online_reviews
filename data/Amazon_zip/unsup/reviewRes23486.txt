O. M. G. I have never had such a satisfying veggie burrito. Usually it's all rice and filler, but not at Irazu's! There was so much crap in that burrito, I couldn't even tell you what I ate. I think there was some zucchini, spinach.... etc? Def not typical burrito stuffins'. I've only ever gotten delivery, which did take the full hour they said it would, but it's still worth it.  Also - guac is to die for.
