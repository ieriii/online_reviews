Grand Lux Cafe. I just can't quit you. Even though sometimes I feel like I should. Like, it's constantly an inner-battle. The decor, location, and overall atmosphere is wonderful, but I feel like such a touristy-tourist who could be at a bunch of other "local" places instead. The waitstaff is always polite, incredibly helpful, and on their game, but I have to suffer through a 30-45 minute wait whenever I go before I even get to that point. And the food. OH, THE FOOD. So varied and delicious, such huge portions, but so expensive. I've had their macaroni and cheese, cornbread, four cheese pizza, cheeseburger, chicken pesto pasta, the chocolate cake which is to die for... all of it delicious. The only thing I have had there that I wasn't fond of was the french fries. They had a bland taste and texture that really disappointed me. I personally find it unacceptable for a place such as this to have bad fries. But gee willikers, it can be expensive. I always leave that place with three things: leftovers, the button on my pants undone because I ate about 3 baskets of their heavenly bread by myself, and a sense of guilt. Guilt because I could've saved time a few dollars going to a billion other small joints around the city and not feeding the Michigan Avenue cash cow. For days when I want to treat my self, though? It's perfect.
