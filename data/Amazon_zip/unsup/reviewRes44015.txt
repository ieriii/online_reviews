While I'm still sticking at 4-stars, I felt the need to update my review. This really is my favorite sushi in the city... the ambiance of the place, the delicious crab rangoon, the fresh rolls and the amazing drinks (Geisha martini? Yes, please!) all make for a great place. I take off a star because the wait staff can be a little snotty, the prices are more than I like to pay, and that $8 corkage fee they are charging is highway robbery. Other than that, I love Wakamono!
