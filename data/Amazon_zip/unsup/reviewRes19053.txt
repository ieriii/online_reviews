We had a great time. I read a few reviews about slow or poor service. This was not our experience. The waiter had a good sense of humor and was attentive. He made recommendations and made sure we had what we needed to make our experience pleasant.  The other comment I saw in reviews was about the noise level. If you want a quiet romantic dinner, this is not the place. I would call it more lively than noisy. The restaurant is alive with activity. People coming, going, eating, laughing and enjoying themselves. The Gage has a very inventive menu, filled with something to entice everyone.
