It's a large restaurant / brewery which has pizza and a brewery. I wanted to give 4 stars but it is just SO crowded every time I go. It's not too expensive and the beers are pretty good.  Try it during the week for a late lunch and it's not that crowded. Or just get carryout from Piece Out, their takeout place next door. Tomatoes and feta are the way to go!
