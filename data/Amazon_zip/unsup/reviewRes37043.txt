i have been going to hopleaf for about 5 years now it is a great place to go if you want to broaden your palate of belgium and craft beers they have about 15 beers on tap and over a hundred bottled as well as a substantial whiskey selection. it gets really packed in there so I always try and go on off nights but the place is always busy regardless of when you go. The bartenders are extremely knowledgeable of the different brews and tthe doorman rocks! love this place and excited about the expansion!
