I made a mental note to visit this place. I didn't think I would be able to, but we ended up going last minute. I don't regret this at all, and I think this was one of the best decisions I have ever made in a long time. I try not to always be so trusting of yelpers, but I'm so glad that I was! There are tortas up the wazoo here! So many choices, and so little time. I got the Pepito and the braised short ribs were melt in my mouth delicious. I wanted to make love to this torta. I was weary of the "pickled" part of the jalapenos, but everything in this torta melded together amazingly. Dipped in the salsa verde, I was in heaven. The cubana torta was also good, and I also had some of that guacamole that they serve and it was also delicious. I did try the churro, which I will say was just ...okay. That made me sad. I sat outside too and it was such a perfect day! The outdoor seating does well for those days it gets crowded (it got crowded after I ordered my food, thankfully), and also when the weather is lovely. It's right next to his other place, Frontera, and I remember not being too impressed with my Frontera Fresco that is located in the basement at Macy's in San Francisco (especially with the price I paid). I have to say that I got my money's worth at XOCO, and I was very, very impressed and satisfied. Rick Bayless does NOT mess around when it comes to food, that's for sure.
