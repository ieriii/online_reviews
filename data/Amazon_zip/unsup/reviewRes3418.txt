I've been here twice and I'll probably go back, but I'm not in love yet with the things I've gotten. They try and have a pretty traditional bulgogi and rice dish, and some other things made with bulgogi (e.g. a burrito) but I haven't fallen in love with any of it, and I heart bulgogi. It's not bad, just not something too exciting. Maybe I'll try the fried chicken next.
