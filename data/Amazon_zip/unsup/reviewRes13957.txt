I lunched here today. IMP, this place is a diner, with a capital "D." I chose crab cakes, because I love them, but tilapia, mahi mahi, shrimp, etal. were there for the taking. The menu features a vast array of fish. I was not disappointed in my selection. Three large tasty crab cakes were accompanied by creamy cole slaw and the best grilled asparagus I have ever tasted, and I usually don't care for asparagus. My lunch mates were also satisfied. We finished up with a big bowl of Hoosier Mama apple pie and a scoop of vanilla ice cream, "for the table." What a pie, what a lunch. I'll be back.
