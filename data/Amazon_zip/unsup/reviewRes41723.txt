Lots of Chicago steakhouses are incredible and serve prime cuts of beef. The thing that sets em apart is how they treat you once you are there. No place treats you better than the staff at Ruth's Chicago - doesn't matter if you compare it to another steak joint or a 5 Star fine dining spot, you will not have a better experience. Highly recommend!!
