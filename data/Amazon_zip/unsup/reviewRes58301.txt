Ok, the honest truth is that if I had a last meal, this would be it...I love this place. Best pizza in the city and I love bringing out of towners to this place as my little discovery...even though its hard to keep a lid on it these days as they are totally getting the recognition they deserve lately. I love the good beer on tap and friendly atmosphere. Please don't go here though-I don't want to wait so long for a table!
