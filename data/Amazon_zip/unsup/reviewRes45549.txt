God, this place is just gorgeous. No detail was spared in the decoration of this establishment. Floor to ceiling this place is done very nicely. Plus it's ginormous. Onto the matter at hand, the food. Pretty good? No, it's really good. Mac and cheese? Delicious. I think it's just the teeniest bit overpriced. I've never been underwhelmed by anything--it's always great. The service? It's been all over the map from awesome to awkward. I think it just depends on the day. However, I've never waited here. Ever. Swear it. If you're in Lakeview, this place is worth a visit.
