Tch, had I not been to Nana before, I'd probably not come back after the experience I had today. It wasn't so much that it was terrible, it was just so completely mediocre. Unlike Lincoln Park, a place in Bridgeport cannot be mediocre and survive. I mean who will schlep to Bridgeport for for a "just-okay" breakfast? No one, I say. No one. So why was it so average? We were talked into ordering the most expensive items on the menu and I'd be delighted for a suggestion had these items been tasty but they were absolutely not. Boooo! Service was inattentive. It's annoying to have to keep asking for water and we were served way after people who sat down after us. We asked for the server to check it on the order and-lo and behold--there it was. The food had been sitting under a heat lamp and was not hot. Booo! I'll come back and give them another shot. After all, I love that they're organic and the restaurant is just beautiful. But these things cannot substitute for great food and solid service. Chickity check yourself, Nana.
