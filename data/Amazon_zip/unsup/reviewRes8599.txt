The restaurant has a great feel to it. The staff is attentive and knowledgeable and the pizza is good(for Chicago). I was brought here while visiting because apparently "It beats any NY pizza" While it was very good it didn't quite stack up. The menu is a little too simple but I did enjoy the Buffalo mozz.
