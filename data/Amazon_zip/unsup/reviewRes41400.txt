my friend brought me here on new years and i get cravings for it on a monthly basis. the beef soup is to die for and its a huge bowl that should fill up any hungry gent. the duck soup (i wish i knew the number) that comes with a duck thigh is also incredible. ive never tasted such succulent broth! can get a bit pricey if you take a date and have smoothies for dessert but it is WELL worth it!
