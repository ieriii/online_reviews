I went to Sprout for brunch on Sunday. Apparently, serving brunch is something new there which may explain the awful food. I'm confused by so many reviews raving about dinner. Maybe dinner is great? I'm not going to find out.  The first clue was all of the quotes around the menu items. Is the "Shrimp and Grits" not really shrimp or grits? Why is "Eggs Benedict" in quotes? This made sense for the deconstructed "Quiche" which turned out to be COLD, truffled egg mouse on top of crackers. It was quite possibly the nastiest thing I've eaten for breakfast. Ever. How that even resembles quiche, I have no idea. Our group ordered 8 dishes total and no one was happy. The Foie Gras Deviled Eggs were bland and overcooked to the point of being rubbery. The Croque Madame was all right except for the weird plum mustard sauce. The Eggs Benedict had very tender delicious lamb but then a strange deep fried square of mashed peas. The Shrimp and Grits (which is actually both) had a delicious curry sauce over them which was tasty but not really appropriate for brunch. I can go get curry at Thai Lagoon anytime. I don't want it for breakfast. And if there's curry over it, what's the point of shrimp and grits? Just make a curry! The Bacon Biscuits were fine but nothing to rave about. In general, the food could be described as "Fail." (quotes intentional) It's incredibly disappointing for a renowned chef to screw up breakfast food so badly. The only reason Sprout gets two stars was the service. Our waiter was excellent and charming. Also the space itself is lovely. Too bad the food doesn't match. Ten thumbs down.
