A couple of friends and I went for dinner at DaVanti. I should say that my boss, who is a foodie, said that this was the best restaurant he's been to in the past year, since he moved to Chicago. So, I was expecting really exceptional food. And, I did enjoy my meal, but I didn't think it was anything so phenomonal or that I would want to immediately return. We had raviolo, rigatoni, proscuitto de parma pizza and a salad. All were very tasty. We ordered a good bottle of wine. Personally, I find the corkage fee a bit annoying b/c it's not really BYOB, you can only purchase wine from them. Therefore, I feel that they should just build the corkage fee into the price so I don't have to think I am paying extra. Service was fairly good - a little slow at times. Good ambience. I would defintely go back to DaVanti, but first I want to check out some other local Italian spots.
