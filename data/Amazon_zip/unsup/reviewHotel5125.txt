ridiculously poor service from the front desk staff. as in, incompetent about the very basics of check-in, billing, and hospitality. $300 rooms were small and outdated, little to no amenities. would not encourage anyone to book a room here-- shop around and stay anywhere else. a definite disservice to the intercontinental brand name.
