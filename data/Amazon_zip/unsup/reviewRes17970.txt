Unfortunately I recommended this place to a girlfriend for her birthday dinner, solely based on the location and great Yelp reviews. We and her other guest were less than impressed and don't plan to return to Caro Mio. I can tell the owner/manager and wait staff are trying to deliver good service, but overall I did not get what I paid for and there were a few simple expectations that I just think failed to be met. It's an Italian place....I was expecting a decent lasagna and perhaps some variety of pizza. They didn't have the latter at all, and the lasagna was mediocre at best...unless you like 80% meat and the rest "meh" pasta and cheese. We also got the eggplant appetizer and based on the price (and just common sense) we were expecting a bit more than a single serving of eggplant....it was like ordering bruschetta and getting a single piece of toasted bread with the toppings.  My meal was good...pretty much what I would expect from any decent Italian place, but at $23 (food/tax) for a pasta dish it lacked quite a bit in value. The food is good and staff are friendly, but you can do MUCH better most anywhere in Chicago for Italian dining.
