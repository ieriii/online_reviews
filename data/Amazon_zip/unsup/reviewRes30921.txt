This might be the best vegetarian restaurant in the world, much less Chicago. Not only does Chicago Diner sling impeccably flavorful vegetarian and vegan preparations of classic diner favorites, but they tip their hand and sell a cookbook full of their best recipes, allowing out-of-towners like me to take some of that good eating home with us. The cookbook is a marvel. The recipes are straightforward, are prepared with items most vegetarians keep on hand anyway, and deliver restaurant-quality results in the comfort and privacy of your own home. There's no shortage of great vegetarian eating here in Seattle, but the Chicago Diner stays at or near the top of my crowded list of favorite vegetarian restaurants. Every time I'm in Chicago (as a dislocated Cub fan I try and make it every year) I go to The Chicago Diner. I can't recommend it highly enough.
