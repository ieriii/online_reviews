My boyfriend has been obsessed lately with finding the best thin(ner) crust pizza in Chicago. We've eaten at Spacca Napoli many times and are always pleased with the service and quality of the food. I should add that we've managed to avoid the crowds by going on a Sat-Sun afternoon before/after a visit to the dog beach. I'm not an olive lover but the bowl of green olives (don't know the name) are yummy! By the way, dogs are allowed on the outdoor patio, which is always a plus for me.
