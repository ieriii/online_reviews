Writing this review is proving to be quite challenging, as I can attest that I have never actually been physically inside this establishment with anything less than a blood-alcohol concentration level of .235. However, I will attempt to do my best with my rather fuzzy recollection. As I recall, the bottomless chips and salsa are quite the delicacy, as are the chicken burritos I repeatedly order upon each of my drunken appearances. I consider myself quite the burrito connoisseur, which is both a blessing and a curse, and I must say that I have nothing negative to report. The burritos are incomprehensibly large, and I have yet been able to completely devour one in one sitting. And even with the addition of avocado, they are still priced in the $6-7 range, which is always beneficial after you had just dropped $80 at Carol's over the preceding few hours. Therefore, if someone has the late-night desire to consume some decent Mexican food, then look no further than Garcia's. I believe that is there motto...or at least should be.
