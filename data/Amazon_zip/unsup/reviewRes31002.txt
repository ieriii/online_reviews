Overall this place is pretty great. A nice atmosphere. The Seared Kobe Beef Tartare was extraordinary. Only arguments would be that it's really loud so we had to really yell to chat with our friends and the servers seemed to be rushing us (taking plates before they were empty, not letting us enjoy our drinks before ordering). The place wasn't full, we weren't holding up any tables for turnover. However, that said, I would still come here again and enjoy more of the amazing foods on the menu.
