Definitely a great atmosphere. Once inside, you forget you are in a generic storefront. The service is usually great, with few exceptions. The food is definitely good, too. It's not the best Italian food in Chicago, but with this place, it is the whole package. Very low-key and somewhat romantic. You will really enjoy this place if you go and don't have ridiculous expectations. Think about it, 2 people can have a great dinner and a bottle of wine for less than $50(of course, it's BYOB). I suggest the homemade pasta dishes.....Don't forget to bring a good bottle of wine.
