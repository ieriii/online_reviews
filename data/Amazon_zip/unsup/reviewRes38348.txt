and i don't drink. Seriously. but the apparati with which to drink is just fun to watch - and a definite plethora to choose from. And the food! to Die for. Mussels for two are most excellent (on special marinated with white wine and lobster bisque . . mmmmm endless bucket, five of us shared) plus pommes frites with aforementioned sauce de garlique - and cabbage salad - most excellent. The rainbow trout was incredible, and all of us sharing - well - it was all just incredible. definately a "go back to" - friendly staff, a little overcrowded, but the crowd was trendy and laid back - so it was fun, rather than meat market. absolutely a five all around.
