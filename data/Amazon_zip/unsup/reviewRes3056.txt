I was really looking forward to this place an their Korean fried kitchen after sampling Korean fried chicken IN Korea. Unfortunately the product doesn't travel well- I found it average at best, the "Seoul sassy" sauce was also marginal as was some "atomic" sauce. The Korean burrito was a joke. What's Korean about it other that the name, even IF you and their home made Korean hot sauce. The earning sign was the staff, they were enjoying tortilla chips and salsa from somewhere else- and they certainly were not o Korean origin. What's the buzz about this place? I will have to try again I guess, I have no idea. Next.......
