Fabulous home brews. Get the Wack Job, a damn fine double IPA. I have no idea why they changed the name from Camel Toe. Aren't those two titles equally sexual? Sadly it can't be purchased in a growler but if you love the hops, the Dysfunctionale substitutes well. Expect about $5 a pint or in the case of the Wack Job, $7. Always gotta pay extra for wack jobs, right? Hurr hurr. Long wait on Saturday nights. Expected. Easily remedied by imbibing aforementioned beverages and listening to live-band karaoke. An Alanis Morissette song absolutely needs real musicians in order to be karaoked. The pizza is thin but oh-so mouth-watering. Pick from one of three pizza choices: Red (marinara and mozzarella), Plain (marinara, garlic, olive oil and parmesan) and White (Olive oil, garlic and mozz). They are also accommodating to vegans. Get some toppings. Whoa! Mashed potatoes, clams, meatballs? Goat and feta cheese? Never a dull piece here! Most notable daily special: Sunday nights carry-out a large pizza and a growler for $25! Also, they happen to host some events frequently so those are worth checking out if you wanna get your 'za on and be sociable at the same time. My curly-haired pizza-dependent pal is in luck because I will gladly indulge her in a pilgrimage to Piece whenever she so desires. In fact, to my other friends, I might become her and it's all thanks to Piece.
