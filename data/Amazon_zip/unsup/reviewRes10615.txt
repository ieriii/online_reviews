Tried this place after a critic cited it as a top 5 to try during restaraunt week. Boy, was that critic off base!! The minute I asked about the restaurant week menu, our waiter took a sheet from my husband's menu, threw it at me, said, "Pick one from each category." and walked away. He came back 15 minutes later and took our order.  We got each course about 15 minutes after we'd finished the last, had to ask for Parmesan cheese 3 times before we got it, and got a water refill once. The pear salad was good, and the Piccolo cheese ravioli had one flavor - fat. Deserts were good. I agree with other reviewers that the chairs in the "covered shed" portion of the place are ridiculously uncomfortable. Could they try to cram more people into this restaurant? I can easily name twenty friendlier, tastier, more enjoyable Italian options in Chicago. I honestly feel like I wasted my money at this place.
