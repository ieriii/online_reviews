Hands Down the best deep dish pizza the world has to offer. I was introduced to deep dish back in 1992 by my cousins there and been back numerous times and tried them all from Uno's, Gino's East, Lou Malnatis', Pequod's , Pizano's, to know Giordano's wins my Award for the best . Giordano's simply takes pride in their crust, ingredients, and sauce-Not bready crap like everywhere else. But watch out don't burn the crap out of the top part of your mouth.
