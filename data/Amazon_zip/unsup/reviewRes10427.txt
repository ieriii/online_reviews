Still incredible. I have now dined several times for both lunch and dinner, and the experience has been nothing less than fabulous. I highly recommend this restaurant to those who are looking to impress friends from out of town, colleagues, a gf/bf, your parents...or foodies genuinely interested in regional Italian cuisine and a great wine list. The chef and owner are both so nice and thoughtful too, only making the experience better!
