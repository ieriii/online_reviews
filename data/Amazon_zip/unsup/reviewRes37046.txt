I'm downgrading. I came here twice a couple years back with a groupon and the whole place was much nicer. With a new groupon in hand, I was eager to head back. Funny how things change over time. There was no one at the cheese counter to help me so I ended up not getting any. I didn't feel like grabbing a whole wheel of camembert. The spice aisle was less than half full which made me avoid buying any spices since I know what's been sitting there for a while. I've never seen a spice shelf so empty in my life. And much of the store seemed to be picked over. It's Sunday morning, what I assume to be peak business hours, and the place felt like I was being given leftovers. Why don't they stock their shelves? On the positive side, their baked items did smell wonderful and they still do carry some prime beef. But the prices here are outrageous - more expensive than Whole Foods which is shocking. I have another groupon to use here but you won't find me back otherwise.
