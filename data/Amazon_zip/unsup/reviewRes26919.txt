My girlfriend and I are huge Rick Bayless fans. The wait for food was incredibly long (~2 hours) but that is the only thing negative I have to say about the place. The food was absolutely mind blowing. Words can't describe the flavors and the service. The most amazing part was that the prices were really quite reasonable.  We started with the ceviche trio and the tacquitos. The ingenuity of the flavors were astonishing. Each had a very unique and different flavor profile. My favorite was the lime, olive, yellow fin. My girlfriend's was the big-eye over guacamole.  For dinner I had the Asada and my girlfriend did the shrimp. The portions were enormous for the price and I can't tell you how delicious it was. The servers clearly knew you had waited a long time and were extremely attentive and not pushy about the most expensive items on the menu.  All around a great experience and I expect to find myself there again... with a reservation.
