Stopped by on a Sunday night for drinks and dinner with a group of 7 - lots of big tables, so it was good for a group this size. The spinach dip was really tasty and the pizzas are really big - we split a medium among four of us with no problem. The tab could get a little pricey if you like a lot of toppings - they are $1.75-$2.00 each. We just had plain pepperoni and it was good - not too greasy, thin crispy crust, good amount of toppings. The best part about Piece is their beer list - lots of brews they make themselves. The Worryin' Ale and Pale Ale were both great - and you can get growlers here. Was a little loud, but overall a fun place.
