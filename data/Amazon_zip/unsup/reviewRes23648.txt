Great place for breakfasts and evening craving for desserts. I went there twice actually, once in the morning and the other time in the evening. It's a cafe style establishment-hence no need to be fussy about your attire. The service is friendly, people are casual, relaxed, and usually happy from consumption of desserts. I loved their tea because it was served with freshly plucked mint leaves and rich honey in tiny turkish glasses. If you want to cuddle with your significant someone over sweet talk, this is the place.
