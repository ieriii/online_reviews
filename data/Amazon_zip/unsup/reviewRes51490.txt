I've been here a couple of times, and Garcia's now boasts a remodeled space, which has expanded the dining area and created larger and more modern bathrooms. It is definitely now a lot easier to reserve for large parties. If you intend to come here, be warned that parking is very lacking in the main square, which is where Garcia's is located. My recommendation is that you park on Western or Lawrence and walk it over.  The atmosphere here is nice, if not a bit loud. The fare is pretty standard Mexican food. The salsa is decent with a good flavor. The main reason I took off two stars is the fact that the food doesn't blow me away. It's pretty mediocre. I am Hispanic and I have high standards for delicious and authentic Mexican food, and this place definitely misses the mark. I had the enchiladas with mole sauce and ground beef filling. The mole was definitely lacking in flavor and spices. For the vegetarians out there, they do offer a combo that includes a broccoli taco.  Another star was taken off due to the service not being that great. The waitress seemed pretty unattentive of us and was definitely aloof and not too friendly. Also, the prices are pretty high for mediocre Mexican food that you can find anywhere else for half the price. $14.00+ for a fajita dish? No thanks. This place is alright if you're already in the area, but I would ceirtainly not go out of my way for it.
