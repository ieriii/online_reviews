Artopolis provides a fun, casual yet tasty lunch location. I love having their Spinach and Feta artopita for lunch, with pasta salad- for $7.50 it is incredibly yummy, filling and made quickly-therefore perfect for that mid-day office get away. I was fortunate enough to taste their Mango moose cake, at a birthday party, which was light, not to sweet, but flavorful. . After 2pm there is full waiter service, which is fine, it is hardly busy at that time of the day. I am eager to return to try some other things on the menu.
