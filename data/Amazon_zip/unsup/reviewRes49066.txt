My fiance and I went on a Saturday night...we had reservations and were seated immediately. The waitstaff was great - on top of things and we didn't feel rushed. The food was pretty good. We tried the chef's selection of oysters, spicy pork rinds, and frites (without the egg). We loved the oysters and fries and the pork rinds were very good...but at one point, it was just a lot of pork rinds...For our main entree, we tried the Basque Stew and he had the Potee. We loved the stew! We even took some home the next day and it reheated well. The Potee was pretty good, but my fiance thought he could cook it, so he was slightly disappointed that he didn't go with the pork belly. Despite the fact that we had a lot of food (our waitor did recommend, two small plates, one large...haha), I still wanted the dessert, and our waitor recommended the waffle. It was very light and refreshing. Oh and the place has a great beer selection! All in all, we highly recommend!
