Just got back from a weekend at the Dana. The place was firing on all cylinders and didn't miss a beat. Early check in, check. Late check out, check. A doorman, TJ who was on top of everything and didn't hesitate to give me the perfect recommendation. The Dana was great. Room size was perfect, bathroom perfect - okay a door in the shower would be nice but that doesn't seem to be the current fashion. Mini bar reasonably priced but there is a Whole Foods, Trader Joe's and Walgreens within two blocks. Free wired and wireless high speed internet. Great locations, everything is close by. Perfect is all I can say - but you still aren't getting 5 stars. :D
