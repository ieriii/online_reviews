This was my second trip to Sapoi Trattoria and it was just as good as the first time! The first time we went was for a Bachlorette party dinner. They personalized the menu with a special message to the bride! I took my parents this time and we were all very impressed with the service and the meal! Everyone should try this neighborhood Italian restaurant! You won't regret it!
