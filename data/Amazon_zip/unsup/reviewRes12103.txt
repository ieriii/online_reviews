Went here for dinner with a couple of friends...had to wait 30 minutes for a table, which I've heard isnt too bad for this place. I had a gf wait 2 hours for a table once...and she also said it was well worth it. Great bar, havent had any of their brews yet but am so so excited they have Strongbow. dont hate-strongbow is wonderful. :) The best thin crust pizza I've had. AND it tasted even better cold the next day. Our server was a bit off but who isnt? The place was crowded, but that was a given.  Also went there for rockband karoake a couple weeks later, hilarious and a great crowd but got boring after awhile. I would definitely head there for March Madness if it werent for the noise, its a little all too much. Great if u dont want to be having meaningful conversation over dinner. :) haha.
