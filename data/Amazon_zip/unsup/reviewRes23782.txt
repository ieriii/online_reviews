My buddy moved out of state and told me that before I moved to the bay, I HAVE to get a steak sandwich from Irazu. I did get one...and then I got another the next day. The steak is lean and there are no gristle-y pieces. The bread is phenomenal as well. Yesterday I ordered a chicken burrito and the chips and guac. Wow. Pretty sure everything is good here. I get a side of yellow rice and sour cream every time, too. Huge fan...kinda pissed I didn't try this place sooner.
