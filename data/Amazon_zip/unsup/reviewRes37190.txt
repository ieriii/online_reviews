Truth be told, we are old and lazy.. and scared to drive drunk but too cheap to pay for long cab rides.. therefore we stay in the neighborhood. We had some friends in town who suggested we meet at Hopleaf.. waaaay out of our comfort zone.. but after visiting Hopleaf, we may have to start venturing out more! We only drank and had some fries to snack on.. but the front bar area is super cool. It's low-key, casual and dark. I don't think there was even any music playing... Normally that would be weird and awkward, but totally wasnt. Its communal first come-first served tables and chairs.. which gives it a kind of coffee house vibe. The beer menu is super heavy and caters to the Belgium/wheat/weiss/white/... beers. Not my thing, really... but there's plenty other selections. Might have to pony up some cash for a long cab ride up north, but this place is worth it. I can smell my own balls.
