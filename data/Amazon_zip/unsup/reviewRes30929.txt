five hundred plus reviews? And this'll be a drop in the bucket. Ok. This place is overpriced for what it is. I get it. Specialty food. Always expensive. But, come on?! This food isn't that spectacular. The beer selection's ok. Anything with alcohol in it that isn't beer: really mediocre. The food is somewhat bland and iffy. I enjoy it, just well, but trying to navigate the insane parking lot, waiting outside for a table and then paying the absurd bill trumps the quality of the food.
