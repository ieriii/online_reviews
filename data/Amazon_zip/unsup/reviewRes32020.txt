My sister is vegan and every time she comes to visit this is an obvious stop. I am glad the food is ALWAYS delicious and the service is always good, but I do have to say that I wish they were a greener restaurant. The prices are a little unfriendly but you do pay for a portion that equals at least two meals, so it's not bad. I've been a regular at this place for about four years and I have very few complaints and a handful of compliments :)
