I live very close to this joint. I try and go here a little more often then I want to because of the proximity. It is great for brunch and breakfast if you can get there in time.  They always seem to be closing when I get there. They also close in between brunch/lunch and dinner some days. I can never remember which days. The problem is that by the time I'm at Wishbone and they are not open I really really really want the crawfish Benedict or the shrimp omelet or the veggie plate. So I guess I should just commit their hours to memory. Like the other reviews stated it can get very kid family stroller crazy in there. If you want to avoid it I suggest dining at the bar in the back. The bartender is always really sweet if slightly absentminded.
