As my original review indicates, my strategy with Violet Hour has been to go on weeknights and sit at the bar, so when an out-of-town friend visited this weekend and really wanted to see the place, I prepared myself to end up liking Violet Hour a little less as a result of... well, what a lot of the yelp reviews complained about. Instead, I was pleasantly surprised by the whole experience. We weren't able to sit at the bar, and though I did miss watching the bartenders and their 101 ways to use a lemon in a drink, our waitress was great - attentive, friendly, and very knowledgeable about the menu. I don't know what all the complaining about the music is about - I found the music then and always to be exactly right for the space, and I love the way they play 4 or 5 CDs shuffled at a time, as compared to a mix that never comes back around to the same artist. I do now understand why, as the bartender told me last time I visited, some one sets a menu on fire every week, because ... yeah, beyond the bar, you can't see or read anything. I was most concerned about waiting in an endless line, so I asked my fellow yelpers for their best advice about when the line turns from manageable to miserable. After waiting out responses from several people who think they're funny and said "go now!" (yes yes, we get it, there's a line), one astute observer (thanks Rob L!) told me that the line starts "as soon as the sun goes down" - which I think is right on the money. We showed up just after 8 and waited for about 5 minutes while they seated the few people in front of us. If you want to show up at 11... I don't know what to tell you, but I'm pleased to learn that a great Saturday night can be had at Violet Hour after all.
