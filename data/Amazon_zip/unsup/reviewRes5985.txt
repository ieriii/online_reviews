Taylor Street is another reason why Chicago is the coolest city in the U.S. I probably haven't been over here in at least 10 years, and the area has become such a neat find. Lots of restaurants, coffee shops and specialty stores - you feel like you're in the city but in a stand-alone neighborhood with a hint of the college town vibe. Walking into Davanti on a Sunday night, I knew this was going to be a fantastic experience. The ambiance is cool and casual while simultaneously warm and inviting. I love all the wood accents, and every light fixture is a work of art in itself. It was really busy for a Sunday, so we waited about half an hour at the bar, which is where I discovered Davanti also sells wine. So, their wine pricing can't get any better. They charge $7 above retail value. (This is unheard of in the city.) The wine list was extensive and had some unexpected additions. Unfortunately I gave up alcohol for lent so I was unable to enjoy this aspect. But my Diet Coke was delicious. Highlights: *pizzas from a wood-burning oven. The tomato/basil: devoured in about a minute. Comes with individual canisters of spices too. * bread. toasted with olive oil. * every pasta on the menu, especially the Paccheri con Salsiccia e Pomodori al forno and the Cacio e Pepe spaghetti * knowledgeable, friendly service There's a nice bar area to hang around at for pizza/appetizers. One of my new favorite spots.
