Love Love Love Chicago Q! Chicago Q is a fairly new restaurant in the area and is a great addition to the Gold Coast. I Love the atmosphere. This restaurant is open till 2:00am on the weekends. I have eaten there at 1:00am, and I have eaten there at 4pm, it doesn't matter what time it is. Its perfect for any occasion at any hour. Chicago q always satisfies my BBQ cravings! I cannot get enough of this restaurant. After old town fest on Sunday we decided to go to Chicago q for dinner . We walked in with a group of six without making reservations. The restaurant was pretty busy, but the staff was extremely accommodating and quickly pushed two tables together near the TV so the guys could watch the game. Their service was outstanding. As soon as we were seated the waiters brought over the complimentary pickles and homemade BBQ Chips... I am obsessed with their pickles. I always eat way too many chips and pickles.. I cannot help it, They are sooo good!! For our entree the girls decided to split the q3 we chose the Brisket, BBQ ribs and pulled pork. We chose the corn bread for our side( ask for honey to drizzle on your corn bread!) We ordered a side of the baked beans.The baked beans have huge chunks of tender Kobe brisket in its unique sweet and spicy sauce, the baked beans are sooo yummy and its pretty much a meal on its own!!The BBQ ribs were falling off the bone. incredible . I would have to say the Kobe brisket is my favorite and cooked to perfection tender and moist. The q3 was more then enough for three girls. We even had left overs! The guys on the other hand needed more then just the q3 between three of them they ordered the appetizer flight, chicken wing appetizer and the q3 with 3 sides. We all left super stuffed. Everyone had a great time!! This restaurant has consistent great BBQ. I cannot wait till the weather gets a little warmer to sit outside. I am already looking forward to returning to this restaurant!! Next time I am saving room for dessert!
