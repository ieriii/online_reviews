My wife and I rarely venture out of Wicker Park, but have good eats, and we'll travel. Ironically, we found out about Crisp through one of our vegetarian friends who live in their neighborhood.  We just got back from our second crisp dinner. It was nice that the owner recognized us, and again complimented me on my watch. He had me at hello :) Anyway, I ordered the whole chicken, "half and half", while my wife got the bi-bim bop with bulgogi. The chicken was crisp and juicy, and my wife just about licked her buddha bowl clean!  Unfortunately, we're leaving Chicago for work, but Crisp is one of those places that I'm sure to visit whenever I come back.
