So I'm sitting here in the middle of typing this review of this wonderful establishment that I have been ordering take-out/delivery from and visiting for the past three years---and my order arrives----20 minutes after I ordered it. Priceless. The food is wonderful, and the location is beautiful, cozy, spacious, and intimate. The service is great, and the delivery is (as previously written) QUICK! (Of course on a Friday/Saturday night delivery may be 40 minutes to an hour) My favorite dish is the Crazy Basil Fried Rice (requested sans Fish Oil, Fish Sauce, & Egg to veganize of course) with the addition of the veggie mock duck. Yes, this option adds $3 to the order but it tastes AMAZING! Also, the Golden Triangle (fried tofu/tofu tempura) is the best you will find anywhere. Perfect texture and crispyness! I've never eaten at another place that does it as well. The Yakisoba (requested sans Fish Oil, Fish Sauce, & Egg to veganize again of course) and Avocado Rolls are also worth ordering. And hark!!! Through yonder window breaks??? ALCOHOL!!!! :) As of late February, Indie Cafe now serves alcoholic libations for your delight. Rock on! Of course I do wish overall everything was a little less expensive, however Thai is usually more expensive than other types of Asian cuisine, and the prices are not unusual. You can even order online through their website if http://grubhub.com isn't your thing, however you will not be able to add additional notes to make your meal vegan like you can on Grubhub, so http://grubhub.com will remain my delivery website of choice. GOOD EATS!!!!!
