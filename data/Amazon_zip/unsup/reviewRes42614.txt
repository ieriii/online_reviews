I want to give them 5 stars, but the problem is that the chicken is hit or miss. Sometimes it seems that it is burned, sometimes it's really oily, but when it's just right... oh jesus. It seems that the quality is inconsistent on the weekends moreso than the weekdays. Pizza is always great. It seems that they lessened on the toppings a little since they first opened (used to be STACKED pizzas), but they are still hearty pizzas. I highly recommend the BBQ chicken pizza with gouda cheese slices.
