I cannot wait to return so that I can try more things from the menu. W.O.W. Now I understand what all of the fuss was about.  The food was fresh, plentiful and so well-priced. This place is easily jammed any night of the week, so be sure to make a reservation. It's entirely convenient to get to from the Brown Line's Western stop and parking was a non-issue.
