Greek restaurants are known for their hospitality, good food, and festive ambiance. In those, as well as all other regards, Greek Islands did not disappoint! The saganaki (flaming cheese appetizer) was good, but that's a dish that is hard to get wrong. Unless I'm cooking it at home. Then I set myself and the cheese and a few of my guests and neighboring squirrels on fire. What really sold me on this place was the leg of lamb. It was, by far, the best lamb I've ever had. It was like the prime rib of lamb. Juicy, tender, perfect temperature... If that had been my cherry-popping Greek food experience, I'd be even more of a whore for Greek food than I already am. I can't wait to take others to this place. Only complaint was that they had run out of my usual Greek favorite, white fish. Had I known that, I would have ordered a different wine to accompany the lamb. (I had a German white, should have gotten a Greek red) Probably my own fault for not asking ahead. The service was impeccable, water glass remained more than half full at all times, and they ever cleared the crumbs from my messy table mates places. I'll be back, because I can't stay away from my Grecian Pimp.
