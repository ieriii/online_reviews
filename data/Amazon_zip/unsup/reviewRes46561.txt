RJ Grunt's is a fantastic restaurant! I absolutely love their salad bar! Their sandwiches are fantastic - burgers are wonderful. You might think the salad bar is a bit pricey, by itself or as a meal. However, you really can go up as many times as you like, and the staff is really good about re-filling the items. The soups at the salad bar are fantastic. They have an assortment of fruits and vegetables, unmatched by any other salad bar I've ever had! In addition, this salad bar offers other salads (string bean, potato) and a few desserts. Enjoy and fill up! The wait can be very long, the bar and small restaurant can be very crowded, and parking (if you don't use valet) is sparse. However, if you take the Clark Street bus and/or go on an off-time (or make reservations!), you will be good to go!
