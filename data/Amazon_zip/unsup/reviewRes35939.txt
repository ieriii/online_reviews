25 cent oysters. check. good service. check. totally cool old chicago vibe. check. this place is a lot of fun. it kind of reminds me of gibson's. the vibe. not as many old men with young women though. hehe. i went for the 25 cent oysters. they come out so quick and the waiter was very attentive. i finally went for a dinner and it was amazing. the service and food were fantastic. i had lobster. delicious. wedge salad. delicious. blue point oysters(my fav)..awesome. and my creme brulee! all in all..the price isn't too bad for everything i ordered and the food again...amazing. :) i will definitely be coming back! 25 cent oysters are the last monday of every month from 3-6. if you try to do the "fastionably late" deal..good luck. you get no goodies!
