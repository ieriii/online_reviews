went to the bongo room finally after hearing everyone talk about how amazing it is or how their friend did bla bla bla and it was awesome etc. i've driven by and seen long lines as well, so when some friends from out of town and a couple other long-lost chums got ahold of me this morning for some eats, i figured we'd be waiting a while. it appears we were early though, around 9:45, and i think they were waiting for me to show up so we could be seated, which happened immediately. there were about 10 other people milling about outside. the food was pretty good, service pretty fast. my socks were not knocked off though... i had a smoked gouda and sausage omelette with their fancied-up potatoes. it was good and plentiful. potatoes were around room temp, which is fine, but i wasn't sure if they were supposed to be. coffee is by intelligentsia i think, which was tasty, and i'm not a big coffee drinker. all in all, it beats a greasy spoon, and wasn't as pricey as i had thought.
