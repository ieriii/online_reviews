8:50pm. The place is still completely packed with Indian people @ an Indian restaurant. I think we've just found a winner.  The complimentary naan with tikka sauce was quality. Great start. Next we ordered: Chicken Tandoori, saffron rice, garlic naan, chicken pakora, and some lamb curry dish. All of them were http://bomb.com. I would just say watch out for some of the curry dishes because they have some peppers that creep up on you. Before you know it, you'll be feverishly wiping sweat from your forehead. My only suggestion would be for the bus boy who decided he should slowly and awkwardly clean/sweep sweep every little crumb off the table with a small triangle puzzle piece. It's not essential to do this right now, especially given people in a serious conversation. You can wait, but if you ARE going to do it, don't sweep off 85% of the stuff and leave the biggest pieces. Maybe this was his way of saying, "Do you not know how to keep food on your plates?". Would love to come back and highly recommend this place to all.
