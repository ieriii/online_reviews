What can I say besides this place is the mecca for vegans! The first time I went here was before I lived in Chicago (About 3 yrs. ago) and it was amazing!!! We sat in the back patio area, it was a nice warm night, the lights were all lit up and it was just such a great atmosphere! The food is amazing...what else can I say? I've probably tried about 65-75% of everything on their menu and haven't hated or disliked anything. Some of the best: nachos, dagwood sandwich, philly cheese steak, etc..the most amazing thing is the Peanut Butter Choc Shake! I had a non-veg friend tell me this was the BEST shake she'd ever had in her life..now that's a good review coming from a non-veg! This place will always be one of my favorite restaurants. I eat here on every b-day and always suggest this place first when we're heading out to eat. The Diner can be enjoyed by vegans, vegetarians and meat eaters. Oh yeah, the blueberry margarita is amazing too! And NOT weak!
