Atmosphere and service were great. Food was delicious, but the portions are ridiculously small, even for small plates. That is the one drawback for me. You need to order A LOT of food to get full. The oysters were awesome and so was each item we ordered, but we actually left and went to Girdanno's for our second supper. Great beer list, too.  Would love for the prices and volume to come down a bit, but I would come back for sure... Just not with a meat and potato crowd.
