This place was great! This was our lunch stop prior to visiting the Art Institute. Lucky us, we stopped in the midst of the lunch/brunch hour. So, I got my egg on with a feta omelet, and my boyfriend had the peppered pastrami sandwich. Both of our dishes were excellent, and we had this appetizer called the "Scottish Egg" which was a giant egg surrounded in meat and deep friend in tempura. Don't listen to the ingredients, and just take a bite! The best part about this place for me was the ambiance--the decor is fabulous with a mix of metal, wood, and wall covered in tea lights. The bar is magnificent as well. I stopped at four stars because I didn't get to have dinner. But it's just a great spot on the mag mile.
