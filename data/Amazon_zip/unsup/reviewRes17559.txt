Pros: Excellent Service, excellent quality food, raspberry mojitos, sound level low as tables are not cramped together, ambiance, interesting fun restrooms. Cons: None What you should know: Opentable member, United Milesplus triple point restaurant. Portion size is great, you don't feel hungry when you leave, raspberry mojitos are one of the best in the city. The dining rooms ambiance is one of the best with huge open ceilings. Not recommended for families with small children. I can't wait go go back to this establishment. My guests and I had one outstanding experience. Including one of my finicky friends that basically only eat potatoes and bland chicken enjoyed the food. Would recommend for anyone that would like to take out a client, adult birthday dinner, anniversary, etc.
