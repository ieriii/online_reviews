I am not an expert on sushi. In fact, this was only my second time ever eating it. So I'm not sure if Coast is "as good as it gets" 5 STARS, because I don't have any experience to base it on. I will say that Coast was pretty damned good! We started with some yellow fin with lime, cilantro, and jalapeno. So good! Our server mentioned having some fresh oysters that had just been flown in so we tried those too. OMG! Praise Jesus! Phenomenal. I could have eaten plates and plates of the oysters and yellow fin appetizers, but we moved on to some rolls. The spicy tuna and spicy salmon rolls were ok. The white dragon roll was probably the best thing that I've ever had in my mouth. It was so good that we ordered another one along with a shrimp tempura atop a roll with asparagus inside. I really loved Coast. The food was really good. It's BYOB. The atmosphere was nice. The staff was friendly. If my date hadn't gotten wasted off of the sake the night would have been perfect.
