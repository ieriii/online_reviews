I have come to prefer and love those little off the beaten path small places that lack any pretense. 90 Miles has it all for me when you're in the right frame of mind: 1. Spot on authentic comida cubano 2. Very reasonably priced 3. Really friendly (...and social) staff. GM was there serving us today. This guy from Ohio couldn't be any further from Cuba on many levels, but had such a great attitude, was really friendly and took pride in the place. I like that. 4. Music. I hate when ethnic places overlook music as part of the flavor. 90 Miles did not disappoint and was pumping classic old school cuban music. Perfect. 5. it's smail. Very intimate. sat on barstools inside and just pigged out. This is my new favorite spot in Chicago when I am in town!!!!
