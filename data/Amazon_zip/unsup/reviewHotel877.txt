We very much enjoyed our stay here over the weekend. We were put on a lower floor at our request ( we like to take the stairs ) with a very nice view of the corner of State and Washington. The room had high ceilings, huge windows, and did not feel cramped at all. It really is a beautifully restored building. The location cannot be beat, at least for our purposes: close to both the Blue and Red lines and a couple blocks from the Metra station and Millenium Park, it's right in the middle of everything. The staff was without exception friendly, enthusiastic and accommodating. They have a wine hour for guests from 5-6pm which featured a selection of two wines from California and a very nice sangria the night we attended. They also have an assortment of coffee and tea available in the lobby in the mornings. We did not try the lobby restaurant, but observed that the bar seems to close kind of early for a hotel bar. Wireless is free if you sign up for their affinity program, which we did. At least in our room, though the signal was plenty strong, the connection seemed very slow even for the purposes of checking e-mail. Overall, it's a comfortable, upscale place to stay in a convenient location, and I thought I got a very good value for the rate I paid. When we are next in Chicago, we'll definitely be looking up the Hotel Burnham again.
