I stayed here in mid-February 2008 for 6 nights and was mildly satisfied with my stay. There were some really nice aspects of the hotel counterbalanced by some major flaws which can result in an average rating at best. To start with the pros.... Hotel was very cheap (approx $100 a night). Granted, it was the off season but this rate was considerably cheaper than many other Chicago hotels in the same class. The Hilton was also very clean, fairly upscale and in a great location. Now onto the negatives.... First and foremost, the room was EXTREMELY dry. The Tunisian Desert would seem humid compared to our room. Every morning began with an extremely dry throat and feelings of impending nosebleeds. I drank more fluids than a marathoner running in Hell. We called maintenance to check out the heating system but they were not able to do anything to correct the situation. We eventually ended up sleeping with the heat off, windows open and water filling every container in the room (ice bucket, all the cups, sink, bathtub.... etc). The second major problem was with the housekeeping staff. They do an excellent job cleaning the rooms and keeping the hotel in great shape but they can be a major annoyance. Every morning (even on Sunday), we were awoken by knocks from housekeeping before 10:30 AM. There were privacy dials on the doors instead of the standard "Do Not Disturb" signs but the housekeeping staff obviously pays no attention to these at all. Even better was the constant peddling of coffee... On several mornings, we had knocks on the door to ask if we needed coffee. Again, the privacy knob was turned and we did not call for the coffee. By the end of the stay, we had a growing stack of coffee packages which we never touched. If it was not for these few major flaws, I could see giving this hotel a 4.5 out of 5 but the way things stand, a feel that a 2 star rating is generous.
