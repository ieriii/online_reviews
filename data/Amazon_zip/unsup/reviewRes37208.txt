I've been wanting to go here for a while, so on Thursday when I finally had the chance, I was really excited. We came around 8:30ish, which obviously is a busy time on a Thursday & it was quite crowded at both bars. They gave us an hour and a half wait, but it ended up only being about 40 min - an hour. Service was quick once we were actually seated. We tried the cheese plate which had manchego, some kind of goat milk cheese, and something else I can't remember, and it came with little toast points, apples, and some kind of nuts. Everything was reaaaaaally good on there. Then for my entree I had the rabbit & dumplings which was GREAT. For 20 bucks, you get a really good sized portion and it was absolutely delicious. Dessert was apple fritters, and those were also amazing. The only qualm I have about this restaurant is the pricing. I think it's a LITTLE overpriced, but considering its popularity and how good the food is, it's worth paying a little more.
