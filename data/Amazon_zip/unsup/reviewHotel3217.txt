This is a nice option when in Chicago. Location is great. Definitely has the vibe and decor that you would expect for the Hard Rock brand. Room review: * Bed is nice and comfortable. Not too hard, not too soft. * Bathroom nicely appointed / strong water pressure in the shower / nice bath products. * Due to the materials they used, some of the furniture is a bit beat up / will be hard to fix (would need to be replaced). Good electronics - big flat screen TV, clock with iPod dock. I was here for a corporate function, so I didn't pay the bill. Good option if you can get in here for $200-300/night.
