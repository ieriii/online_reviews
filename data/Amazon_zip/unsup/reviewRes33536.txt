Okay, I must admit, I came here once for an omelette and wasn't that impressed. This was probably two years ago. I came back today and ordered the South of the Border Benny and it was AMAZING! Nothing beats a new way to serve a typical egg's benedict. Just the way I dream of it in my head. A benny with chorizo. Drool. It was fabulous and I finished all of it. It hit the spot for sure. Love the bit of spiciness. I put my name down for 6 people at 11:20am, and my name got called at 11:33am. Unfortunately, my party was not all present so I had to give up my table. I am so jealous of the cheap Chicago brunch prices. Wish I could go here every weekend!
