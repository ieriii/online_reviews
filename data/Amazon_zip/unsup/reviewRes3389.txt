I have it on good authority that Crisp accommodates to my inner fat girl, true story. Stopped in here last Friday and though I thought I wanted the Baby Buddha Bowl (their version of bibimbop) I opted for the Seoul Steak Bowl instead. I didn't love it, but I didn't hate it -- the first three bites were fantastic....and then the steak (and oil) began to really sit with me so I had to push it aside because eating it in one sitting was not going to happen. My boyfriend ordered a whole chicken -- half Seoul Sassy and half Crisp. Holyballs. These two flavors are virtually unlike one another, Seoul Sassy is tangy and packs a punch while Crisp is sweet and spicy, the latter of which seriously blew my mind. Four stars just for the Crisp flavored drumstick I inhaled, well done folks...well done. Also, I love love the set up here. It's kind of like family seating, giant tables, plenty of chairs, you'll be sharing your dinner with others. Additionally, I love the stools overlooking Broadway -- people watching is always a big fat plus. The guys working here are super friendly, we'll be back for sure.
