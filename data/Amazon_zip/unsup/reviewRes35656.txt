I have heard about the great Sun Wah for a while now, and I finally got a chance to check it out. I was very surprised by the space. One big open room, well-lit with lots of exposed warm brick. It didn't exactly gel with the dingy small image in my head for Argyle's best roasted duck house. If you're familiar with NYC Chinatown, I was picturing Big Wong's. You can't go wrong with the egg noodle soup with roast duck and wontons. Thin egg noodles in a solid broth. Wontons are a mixture of shrimp and pork, packed more loosely than the shrimp dumplings. The non-descript "vegetable stir-fry" is surprisingly outstanding. A must-order on my next trip. Sun Wah is getting added to my roster of favorite Argyle street eats! Service was attentive and friendly, and let us linger indoors, away from the winter cold. The carry-out ordering area is so clever, with the clear glass board and the menu written in chalk.
