This was my second time dining here. The first was on Halloween, 2009. I decided to start a new tradition of very fine dining on Halloween, an adult indulgence on a day ordinarily reserved for children. The first meal became the best meal of my life (and I have been to a lot of places). The second meal was just as memorable if not more so.This time it was in celebration of my 17th year anniversary with my partner. We flew from San Francisco just for the night, just to dine at Alinea. That is how highly I regard this restaurant. Back to SF in the morning feeling we truly had experienced magic.
