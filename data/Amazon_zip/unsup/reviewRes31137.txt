I returned to the Chicago diner when I was craving smoked-tasting fake meat. The food was muuuuch better this time. I ordered the BBQ bacon cheeseburger with sweet potato fries. AMAZING. It really hit the spot. My husband ordered the philly cheese steak, which was also good, but not as good as my burger. Mmm I am drooling just thinking about it. HOWEVER. The woman who seemed to be the hostess/manager was extremely rude. First she seated us at a table by the door... which I thought was fine because, even though it was cold outside, there are two doors to the outside so there isn't a breeze when people come in. But my dining partners didn't want to sit by the door, so that's fine. When we asked to be moved to, she told us there weren't any other tables opening up. Fine. She then rudely told us once we were "seated" we couldn't move. Which I guess means once we got water and stuff we couldn't move to a different table? Ok, whatever, if that's their policy. A booth opened up a minute later, so we were able to move anyway. However, she struck again at the end of the meal, when we were chatting for about 10 minutes after we got our bill. She came over and actually asked us to leave! I mean, really? It's not like we were sitting there for hours reading books. This is a restaurant, not a fast food place. Yes, I understand there is a wait on a Friday night... and we waited for our table as well. But come on... it's just plain rude to ask a customer to leave their table. I waitressed for 10 years through high school and college, and although it's annoying to have your table occupied when there are customers waiting to be seated, you DEAL WITH IT. I have never asked a customer to get up. Just rude. Sure fire way to get someone to never return. By the way, our actual waiter was really nice... but I wonder if he put bitchy hostess up to this so we wouldn't cheap out on his tip. That being said, I will begrudgingly come back because their food is pretty awesome.
