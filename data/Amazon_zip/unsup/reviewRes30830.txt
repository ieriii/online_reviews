Going to Nana is like seeing a duck walking down the street. You don't know why it's there, but it seems to be doing fine, which is even more puzzling. This restaurant looks like it was scooped up from Lincoln Park, prices and all, and plopped down in Bridgeport. During a dinner in January of 2012, it still seemed as though they were getting their restaurateur's feet under them. I ordered a pint of beer and my partner a glass of wine; the server had time to pass our table twice before we got them. The place wasn't crowed, so it felt like the rhythm of the staff wasn't established yet: a forgivable offense considering the rest of the night. The food was excellent. I had the wood-smoked pork shoulder with poblano-cheddar grits, bacon-braised greens, and cranberry-jalapeno marmalade. The pork was tender and flavorful and I fully intended to recreate those poblano-cheddar grits in my own kitchen. My partner had a crab cake special that she raved about. In contrast to the drinks, the food came out very quick; about a quarter of a pint's worth of time. As a native from Bridgeport, it's great to see the neighborhood getting businesses like this, but I fear that they aren't catering to the neighborhood's residents.
