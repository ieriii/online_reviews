I enjoyed myself here. Service was fast, and I thought the food was great. Prices were also reasonable. I had the (just remember I'm starting out on Sushi) "Hotel California Roll" and the Shrimp Tempura Roll. I thought the shrimp roll was awesome compared to what I've had in the past. I love the fact that it's BYOB, and even though the seating area is minimal, they turn their tables fast, and there's a few tables outside as well. My brother had the "Peter Parker Spider Roll" and said it was great (I had to mention the names as they were too cute not to!). I'll be back here, dine in, carry-out or even delivery!
