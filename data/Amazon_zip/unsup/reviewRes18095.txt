On this foggy, chilly night in February, my cousin and I strolled into Caro Mio for a quiet meal together. The walls of the restaurant are a vibrant red-pepper color, with lovely local art hanging by the light of candle-powered chandeliers. Lovely and cozy, very Chicago, and just the right atmosphere to melt away the drabness of the day. The crowd was small when we arrived, though we got the last 2-top in the dining room. Around 7 p.m., the tables really started filling up, and by the time we got our food the place was packed. That's always nice to see on a Monday! Based on the heavy traffic, I thought our food would be stellar. Our server, who was flamboyant, wildly gesticulatory and SLOOOOOOOOW as molasses in January, had plenty of good things to say about the food. We ordered... And waited. And waited some more. Half an HOUR later, our meals finally arrived. They must have gone to buy the cheap, flavorless chicken for our dishes in Italy. I'm sad about it. I had pollo alla parmigiana, sort of my Italian litmus test: rubbery, heavy on the breading and DROWNED in cheese and sauce. My cousin's chicken piccata was much prettier and tasted better (than mine), but she still wasn't terribly happy with it. We finished our food, and 15 minutes later, our very gay and adorable server came over and asked us if we wanted dessert. By that time, we'd been there more than an hour and needed to get my cousin's Zipcar back to its home, so we just wanted to leave. Another 15 minutes later, we'd signed our credit card receipts and headed back into the fog. Le sigh. Just looking for that really special restaurant experience in Chicago... The search continues.
