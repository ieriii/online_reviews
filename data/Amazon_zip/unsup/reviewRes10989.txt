Really? The wait is how long? You're serving breakfast, right? What, are the omelets made from the eggs of some endangered species? The thought-to-be-extinct Dodo, mayhaps? And $4 for a little glass of orange juice?! Really?! That OJ better come with some booze or a hand job or at least have someone come to my table with a bag of oranges and squeeze them with their bare hands into my waiting glass. I realize Bongo Room isn't the only breakfast joint in town to price gouge it's patrons for a glass of "Fresh-squeezed" OJ, but it's something that has bothered me for a long time and I needed to get that off my chest. Thanks for listening. Before I go on, just know that I haaaate waiting in line. It's the reason I hate Six Flags, the DMV, and Communism. When it's a Saturday or Sunday morning, the last thing I want to do is stand outside with my eyes half closed, possibly hungover, and wait for a melodic voice call my name. This town is in dire need of some more breakfast places and soon. Look, just because it has a line outside, hip decor, and is located amidst hip used clothing stores doesn't mean it's anything special. I really really believe that people have allowed these characteristics to influence how they feel about this place. It's good food. That's it. It ain't great, folks. And certainly not worth waiting in line for or paying that much for. Now, I'm going to say something that might raise some hackles with the fairer sex, but I gotta say that, for some reason, it seems to be only girls that just LOOOOVE this place. Love it like Bongo is servin' up heaping plates of cocaine or smack. Scroll down through the reviews. Mostly girls. Just an observation. Sorry for the lengthy diatribe for a place that really isn't that bad. Just avoid the weekends and ask if they have any OJ from concentrate.
