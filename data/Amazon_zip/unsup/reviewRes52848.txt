I adore this place, I have Cuban roots and I can tell you that this is it, this is authentic Cuban food, prepared exactly like you would have it at Havana restaurant (actually better). Their 'Ropa Vieja' is to die for, as well as pretty much everything else in the menu. My boyfriend who is Cuban also loves it. I also love the ambiance of the place, the look of the building can deceive, they have a really nice big space with a wonderful covered patio. I also have to say that this location is waaaay better than the one in Clybourn, (don't be mistaken by the reviews). The Clybourn location is actually closer to our house, but their food is not as good, and not well made like at this location. We ordered from them once and were greatly disappointed. The only negative thing I see is that they keep raising their prices. We are regulars so is kind of a bummer to have to pay more for the same food you have been buying for cheaper. Overall great spot, highly recommended.
