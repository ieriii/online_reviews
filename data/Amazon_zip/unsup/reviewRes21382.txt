They probably have some of the best chips and salsa I've ever had. The food is pretty much up to par and they're very generous with their portions. I will say that the rice and beans are sometimes better than the main course (which shouldn't be the case), but they are very delicious rice beans, yum. The highlight for me is the margaritas. They're very generous with the pitchers with plenty of alcohol in them. My favorite flavor is now the Jamaican flower, yum. Bottom line: Come for the food, stay for the margaritas.
