I've been to L&E more times that I can count. I have NEVER had a bad experience. I've been in for drinks on a Wednesday with my girlfriend, I've been for dinner with 6 friends on a Saturday, I've walked in for brunch, I've saddled up to the bar and tied one on. I even carved a pumpkin on the back patio. And I've never had a bad experience. This weekend they're having an Adult Easter Egg Hunt. The food is just sheer fantastic awesomeness and the whiskey is plentiful. You should really, really go check it out. It's easily, hands down, my favorite place in the city. Oh. And I have their Yelp review postcard on my fridge cause it's hilarious.
