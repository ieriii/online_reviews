There are only 3 places I think that have decent Korean food in Chicago and this happens to be one of them. I love going there with my non Korean friends since they offer so many side dishes that they can try. Quality of food is consistent and they are open 24/7 which is awesome. You should stick to the tabletop BBQ if you are going here since other dishes (except for seafood pancake) is not that impressive but still decent. And don't go there w/nice clothes on..in fact, grunge it since your clothes will stink like BBQ. We used to bring change of clothes if we were going out since it's just way too stinky to walk around with that smell on ya. They got small parking lot and usually have no problem finding street parking w/in couple of blocks if it's full.
