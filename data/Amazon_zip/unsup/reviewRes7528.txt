I am a fan, and will be back, but I wasn't blown away by it. I love that they give you chips as a little snack while you are waiting to order, I thought the chips were delicious. The service was wonderful, so quick I couldn't believe how quick we received our food. I ordered the pulled chicken sandwich with fries. The fries were SO good, the chicken was a little dry, but with the help of the 3 sauces provided it was good. We split mashed potatoes, because I heard I had to try them, and they were amazing. I saw others eating the macaroni and cheese and that also looked amazing. I thought the atmosphere and service was great, and the food was good, just not amazing to me. I will definitely go back, because I love barbeque...
