It had been about a year since we tried this place, so my husband and I gave it another go, despite being pretty underwhelmed the first time. Apparently in that year's time the food got worse instead of better. The steak tacos were dry and bland and my husband's breakfast burrito, while big, lacked flavor (and had pretty much no chorizo in it). The queso fundido was good (but it's pretty hard to screw that up). There's really no reason to go to this place with Los Nopales in the neighborhood. The only reason we ended up there, actually, was because my husband wanted a margarita (Los Nopales is BYOB).
