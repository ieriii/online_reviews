A place with over 800 reviews doesn't need mine. But I'm gonna anyway, because Pequod's is part of why Chicago is awesome (to me). You know how some people get hung up on ex-boyfriends or ex-girlfriends? They remember past relationships so fondly that every relationship from then on gets compared to that "one." Yeah. That's pretty much how I feel about Pequod's. This was the first deep dish pizza I had when I moved to Chicago a year ago and it might as well have been the only deep dish pizza I've had. Sure, I've come across others during my time here, but nothing compares (cue Sinead O'Connor's bald head here). Sure, the atmosphere is very Chicago sports bar-y, but you'll forget all about that when that tomatoey, cheesy, and whatever other toppings-y slice hits your taste buds. I don't know how they do it, but the caramelized crust is perfectly cheesy, crunchy, but chewy at the same time. I could seriously eat an entire pizza, of just caramelized crust. I don't know what that would look like, but I don't care, I want it in my belly. As for the rest of the pizza, they don't hold back on the toppings, and you'll eat until you're painfully full, but still want to eat more. It's just that good. The pizza, beer, and service is great, and even though this is such a popular pizza spot, they've maintained a hometown, local feel, which I love. So play roulette with the topping choices, they're all pretty dang delicious. Just eat here, and get hung up on their pizza like I am.
