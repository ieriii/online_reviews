The Violet Hour is a very special place. I'm certainly no goth, but I've always had an affinity for the dark, and the Violet Hour caters to it quite well. There's something about black, and leather, and velvet, and high-backed chairs, and dim lighting; walking into the Violet Hour is like walking into another world. The ambiance is so enthralling. It's somewhat like a cross between a speakeasy during the times of prohibition, and how I imagine a Vampire's den might be. I've never seen anything else quite like it. As amazing as the Violet Hour looks, I imagine most people go for the drinks, and they do not disappoint. They are expensive, but they'll probably be the best drinks you've ever had. They're really not even drinks, they're more like art. The only thing ordinary about the Violet Hour is the service. I've had varying experiences. Sometimes great, sometimes OK, and sometimes really bad. The worst time, we waited 20 minutes for the waitress to come by, and then another 20 minutes to get our drinks, and that was on a weekday. So it's hit or miss, but still definitely worth it. My only real complaint, is that unfortunately the Violet Hour has become something of a novelty lately. The people that go there don't seem to appreciate it very much, which I find to noticeably detract from the experience. The first time I went it seemed more . . . authentic; there seemed to be a sense of awe in the room. But now it's filled with people who seem to be unaware of how magical it is, and are only interested in the place because it's kind of a secret that other people don't know about.
