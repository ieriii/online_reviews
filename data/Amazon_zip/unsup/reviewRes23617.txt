Authentic, but VERY spicy, Chinese food. Tony Hu's place is one of the best Chinese restaurants I've ever been to. The food is outstanding and worth the occasional wait. However, fair warning, sometimes the dishes are almost too spicy to be enjoyed. Favorites are the green bean and black bean appetizer, homestyle tofu, hot and sour soup, and the dry spiced chicken. Ma Pao bean curd is essentially tofu cubes swimming in chili oil - killer, but delicious. Again, if you like leaving with tears in your eyes, go nuts. Otherwise, ask for mild!
