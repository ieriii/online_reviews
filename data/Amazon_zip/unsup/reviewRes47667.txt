Wow a ton of bad reviews. I went here a few weeks ago for my husband's work dinner. There was about 9 of us I think. Our table wasn't quite ready so we went upstairs to have a few drinks. The rooftop bar is pretty cool but with it comes that typical kind of clientele. You know yuppie types and wannabe older scenesters (not hipsters, old scenesters). It is what it is but I enjoyed my drink and company. Our table was ready so we were sent downstairs. I thought our service was really good. The food was super tasty. The harvest salads were good. The meats and seafood were good. We ordered great wines to go along with. We ordered a bunch of desserts. The creme brulee was tasty but way too big. The apple pie parfait thing wasn't really that great. Would I go again? Sure. I'll keep going until I have a bad experience at a place. My friend had the best description of this place...he said it was Soup Plantation for rich yuppies.
