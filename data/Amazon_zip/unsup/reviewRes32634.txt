This was my first experience with Ethiopian food, and I was very pleased. The service was helpful in regards to guiding us in the right direction in the choices we were going to make in regards to food. I don't remember exactly what my group got, but it was an assortment of lamb, beef, and vegetarian options. I tried them all and thought they were delicious, especially the spicier options. Overall, I would like to come back here, but I would be more willing to try other Ethiopian places first. Yet I would certainly recommend Demera to anyone who has not tried this cuisine before.
