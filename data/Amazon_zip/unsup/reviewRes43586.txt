This was the worst experience and worst food I've ever been delivered. The staff was confused and sounded chaotic when I called to place my order. They told me that it wold be about 45 minutes, it took an hour and 40 minutes. I called to check on the order and was told that the driver "just left" and then when I called again 20 minutes later was again told "the driver just left". They kept putting me on hold and then a different person would answer. I had to repeat my question at least 3 times both times I called, and they acted like I was speaking a foreign language. I had to go to the lobby to get the food because the driver couldn't work the buzzer (even though I tried to talk him through it). The food was ice cold and the sides that I ordered were missing. The onion rings were soggy and gross and the pizza was barely edible. I paid $30 and threw the food away because I was gagging it down. This is the worst food and service I've ever received.
