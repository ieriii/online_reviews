I'm still a huge fan of my beloved RevBrew, but I probably won't be coming back during daylight hours. The service was super slow, it should never take 12 minutes to get a basic drink order filled when there are only 3 other tables with patrons(2 coffee, 1 tea, 1 beer). We brought 2 people we've been bragging about this place to for months and they failed to be impressed & we looked like dumbasses for raving about RevBrew. The food was still good. Was super happy to get Metropolis coffee and the cherry mimosa was a nice change from the traditional OJ. Cherry porter pancakes had maybe a dozen cherries on them(not enough if it's in the name of the dish), but they were yummy with good texture. The homemade sausage was also tasty. One more sweet breakfast dish please-with a kitchen that puts out so many fantastic desserts, I was surprised to see just one non savory breakfast dish. We asked a passing waiter about the tour, which the website says is at noon on Saturdays(it was 11:55)& for us to sign up at the hostess stand-that it would be starting around 12:30. I go up and as I'm putting our names on the list, the tour leaves. I tell the hostess what we'd been told & she apologizes and tells us we can join. We'd put in a dessert order since we'd been told we had 30 minutes until the tour began. Man, I thought this place was good looking at night-it looks just as pretty during the day-you notice details you miss is the evening. Love the decor & the fact that the art changes. Way cool. I tasted my friend's pint of Repo Man & was surprised to find it much lighter than I thought it would be-very yummy! Get it together, daytime staff! Night shift, you got it goin' on!
