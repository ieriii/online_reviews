I was super excited when my friend called and invited me for lunch to Wilde. I have passed by a few times and really wanted to try this place. We sat on the patio and started with their iced tea vodka and lemonade drinks. Oh man, this drink goes down easy and doesn't even taste alcoholic. I had 2 of these and then BAM! Tipsy. Those sneak up on you. We started with the fried cheesy potato things. Ohhh yum. I love the dipping sauce. For my entree, I was super torn between fish and chips, curry, and shepard's pie, but went with the curry. It was a huge portion. I think I ate about 1/4 of it and took the rest home. It was very tasty. I definitely enjoyed the food here. Our server was really nice. It was also great people watching on Broadway. It was really pricey for lunch though (about $40 with tax and tip and split appetizer), but I also had 2 drinks. However, I really like this place and will be back! I am looking forward to a chilly day so that I can sit by the roaring fire in the library room with a pint!
