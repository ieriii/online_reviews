After hearing some recommendations about this place from friends, Mr. and I finally went. We tried to go in around 7:20 on a Friday night with no reservation... Yep, we were first-timers. The hostess was very pleasant and helpful, took our number down and called about 25 mins later to offer us a seat at the bar; but we ended up waiting about another 20 mins for a table (worth it!) and eventually headed back to Glenn's. (*Had to wait in a bar next door, because there is literally no waiting room, unless you crowd the walls near the door, which is bad and annoying to seated customers) This place was packed! and it's small/cute/cozy. Our waiter was great, really friendly and explained any/everything to us, offering suggestions and his opinions on certain dishes.  We started off with two beers I had never heard of, but they both were great (they had a nice selection of unusual beers), and a cup of the clam chowder. I'm not a huge chowder fan, but this was awesome. Fresh, meaty, big chunks of potato/veggies, good flavor, very comfort-food. Took advantage of the gigantic tin of crackers, nice selection, nice touch. (*This has inspired me to try to make my own clam chowder; goal yet to be completed) Our entrees: we both went with fish dishes (you should too). A friendly suggestion to Glenn: print your seafood menus from the chalkboards on paper so we can read them easier at the tables. Even cheap paper/printing would be fine. It was hard to see/read the menu! Anyway, I chose the rainbow trout with pecans/brown butter, with veggies/potatoes. This was a large portion, cooked perfectly. Delicious. Would have loved to try dessert, but we were too full. Next time! This was a nice looking/feeling restaurant with great waitstaff, and delicious food. Everything felt personal and down-to-earth.
