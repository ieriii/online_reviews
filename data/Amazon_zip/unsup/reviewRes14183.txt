We went there just this afternoon. I will caveat this with what everyone else has already mentioned: opening week, no perfection expected. And I vow to return in a few months and expect it to bump to my usual three stars. The four and a half of us enjoyed the beer. They were all delicious and I am not a beer guy. They were all refreshing with a great aftertaste. We sat near the brew room and it's gorgeous and a shining reminder where the beer comes from. So it's with some sadness that the decor takes a bit of hit. Beautiful wood and exposed brick with iron light fixtures. Which makes it a bit cold and loud. There's no softness and nothing to absorb the deafening rumble of conversation. And with so many tables you have no room to move without bumping into someone. Maybe these things will change in time. The food is something I will reserve criticism on until I return. At the table was the tempeh reuben and I had the Farmers burger. It was served at the right temperature and was well prepared. But it had a very flat taste. And all of us had fries -- sorry, frites -- and they were stone cold. Not just mildly warm (my dad calls that cold) but cold. We mentioned it to our server who was very apologetic and said she'd return with new fries. Same thing three out of four new side plates. Weird. And not worth the $12 price tag in my opinion. For the four of us with 6 beers between us and four sandwiches it came to $72. That's great for a night out, but for lunch it seems a bit steep. The clientele they're attracting is definitely for the new Logan Square folks, to go with the new condos and VWs I see all over the neighborhood. Parking's extremely limited now that they've opened. Saturday parking on Milwaukee is near impossible. Be careful on the side streets with zoned parking restictions in full force. I am excited it's finally open. I plan to return for sure, but likely not for a little bit. And definitely on a Tuesday night. I do wish them great success.
