good thinking.1- change your hours without notifying anyone publishing them(took a bus to go there for lunch and it was closed)2- stop delivering without telling your employees(just sat on the phone ordering to hear they dont deliver no more its even on their website that they deliver)3- raise menu prices (they just raised last week apparently)$47 for a soup, veggies, and fettucini.no thanks- ill cut up garlic and add olive oil myself
