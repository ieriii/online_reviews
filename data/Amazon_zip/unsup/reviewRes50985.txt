So good! I got the salmon cakes and ate the right up. The best part was the host asked me "would you like a booth, a table or the back room where there are no kids"...hahaha. We were feeling social, so we sat in the main room with the kids. The food was great and the side (you get to pick two) were so yummy. Great place within walking distance of many who live in lakeview/roscoe village. The perfect spot to get some southern comfort food to warm you up in the winter. ps. free cornbread on the table!
