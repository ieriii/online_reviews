Am i a princess? Shaw's seemed to think i was. I went here recently and had the best food (coconut shrimp, and the grouper was amazing), the best service (some wonderful gay man in his 20's, i think) and we we're seated right away, at the time of our reservation. perfect dining experience. classy joint. soooo happy to have leftovers!
