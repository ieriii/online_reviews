Great beer. Great Pizza (probably made greater in my mind since we had been waiting so long: I was SO hungry by then, and had also consumed a few pints of beer both before and during inhalation of the pizza when it finally came.) I liked that they had the ability to add goat cheese and feta, and could make the two halves of the pizza different things. Very versatile and crowd-pleasing, which was great. Only downside was that it took us quite a while to get seated (1.5 hr) when we had been told a wait of about 45 min. Of course that can't be always spot on, but I would reconsider coming here when it's crowded and I was really hungry. Oh, and we also had the taster array of all of their beers that they brew, which was a bunch of fun and really enjoyable. Recommended! Especially if you're a microbrewery enthusiast like myself. Oh, and our waiter (once we were finally seated) was AWESOME. Fun, helpful, decisive and perfectly attentive.
