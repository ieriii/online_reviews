Ahhh Mayan Palace - it's about time I review you! Fellow yelpers reading this - understand that this is some of the best Mexican food you will find short of Pilsen! Also if you happen to be in the mood for mexican on say a random tuesday or thursday - they do HALF PRICE margaritas - ALL DAY on these days!!! Want to try something unique? Their tamarind margaritas rock! and they also have strawberry, peach, pineapple, etc. Overall the staff is kind, the ambiance is spot on, and the food and drinks are delish. I've been all over and nothing compares - so if you haven't been here yet - make a plan and make it happen!
