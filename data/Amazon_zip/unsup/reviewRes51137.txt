We were on our way to the Jewel to pick up some groceries for dinner and paused to check out the menu posted in the window of Big Jones. Before we knew it, we were sitting down at a table and trying boiled peanuts for the very first time (kind of mushy and cold, though our server sympathized that most Yankees find boiled peanuts a little...unusual). My craving for a burger was nicely satisfied by the truly towering tallgrass option on the menu (though the center was a tad red for medium), and the gumbo ya-ya was good though it could have been warmer. The a'plenty was tasty as promised, and the ginger sweet tea was great - the sweet ginger syrup was sitting in its own small flask perched on top of the sleek pitcher of tea below. We had no room left for dessert, though on our way out we saw a slice of something amazing-looking that made us wish we'd saved some.
