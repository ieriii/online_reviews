I'm totally coming back. I'll admit - the service was a little weird. Our waiter wasn't particularly welcoming, but he was attentive enough to let that slide. Everything on the menu looked absolutely delicious. My friend and I both decided to go a little overboard and order cheeseburgers. The burgers were flavorful and juicy, just how I like them, with the juice practically soaking through the bun, and the fries were too good to stop. The burgers also came with large (I'm talking half a cucumber) fresh pickles which were oh so good. We discovered a stylish downstairs lounge on our way to the bathroom, so we'll definitely be back for happy hour as soon as I start working.
