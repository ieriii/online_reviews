Love love love. Drink to try: Juliet & Romeo..I get it every single time I go. It is a gin drink with a little rosewater on a mint leaf to finish...so you get that intoxicating rose smell with every sip! I'm obsessed with the decor and the vibe. Its like being in a doll house/Alice in Wonderland scene, and its all candle light. I personally think its best to sit at the bar, but I've had great experiences in the chairs (intriguing style with the high back) and in the back room by the fire (we had a big group that night). Bartenders take their time and make it right! Also...the tater tots...I die with each bite...I want them now.... Every time I leave that place I feel like I'm on cloud 9, smiling from ear to ear...which is probably a result of their unseemingly strong drinks, and the combination of pleasing attributes experienced through each sense. I could go on forever... Go there, and go there often!
