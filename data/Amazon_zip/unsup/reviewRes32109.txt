I have been here for brunch and for dinner a few times. Brunch is good but pricey. They have these great "kits" that come with a sparkling wine bottle and juices (lychee, strawberry, and mango) to make your own drinks. They have dum sum items (twice the price of regular dim sum) but it is still good. They also have a limited version of the sushi menu. The food did take a while to come out and the server forgot to bring things we asked for. It wasnt that busy. The bus boys were all really good though. They brought us things when our waiter forgot. Brunch for three people was $150. For dinner, it is a lot louder. And, more sceney. It has a nice little lounge area to grab a drink while waiting for your table or whatever. The food is good. A lot of the reviews tell you what's good so I will refrain. Overall, very good and I will be back.
