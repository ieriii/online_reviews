I ate here for the very first time........I had no idea what to expect. I have always been afraid as I am a very picky eater...as I have never had Thai food! All i know is that i wanted my food cooked and not raw, however that's sushi or whatever......as you can tell I don't know my foods! Ha! Anyway, i got some basic stuff, rice with chicken and some spicey sauce or something........not too bad!! Very good actually!  Hey, at least I got my feet wet and tried it, now I can go back and try different things! The service was very good, very friendly too! Prices are good!
