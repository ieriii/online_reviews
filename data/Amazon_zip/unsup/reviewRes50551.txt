This place rocks. First off the drinks. The Charleston Mule and Death of St. Germaine were fantastic. Autumn Sangria was so-so. For first courses we got the soup potion gumbo which was huge and spiced just right and the porkbelly-johnny cakes which were nice. Wife went with the pork chop with this amazing sweet potato hash with huge pieces of bacon in it. Loved it. I opted for shrimp and grits which were nice. We decided on the bread pudding for desert which was the only thing that fell flat. Great service, nice atmosphere, definitely will be back.
