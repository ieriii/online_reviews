I came here because I've never had Ethiopian food, and the reviews on yelp directed me to Demera. The waitres recommended the Demera Messob. The food on the plate was ok- fish curry, lentils, spinach, a salad, goat curry, shrimp curry, and a beet-mixture. My problem lies in the bread. It was cold, looked and felt like sticky carpet lining, and tasted awful. This bread left a nasty taste in my mouth, and had me nauseated until the next day.
