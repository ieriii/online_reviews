I don't understand any of the enthusiasm for this place. I don't think it's even as good as the Francesca restaurants, which, at a time, for a while, were quite good, though now, at a different time, with tons more competition, they're just pretty good. First, the waitstaff seems to know little about the wines. I don't believe that directing me to three or four reds and giving me very, very generic info is very meaningful or helpful. I think that if I provide a price range and a flavor profile, and can even say these are Italians I like vs. these are ones I don't like, then a waiter at an allegedly wine-focused restaurant should be able to tell me a few tidbits about the bottles he recommends--who makes it and how, where it's from, the grapes, what food it might be best with, any of that sort of stuff. Second, the food just isn't that great. Even the pizza we had--the best of what we ate--was pretty bad compared to the better pizza at other, similar restaurants. the worst of what we ate--the grilled octopus--was really skimpy at $17 and, well, just didnlt taste good. The roasted corn and walnut salad was awful, though recommended by the waiter; the corn had no fresh, roasted flavor and was so soggy ot could have come from a can. I tend to think that the Eater 38 Chicago list is highly reliable and sort of genius-y, the way it "gets" great that's high and low, but putting Davanti on that list mystifies me. Thetre are only two places on the current list that, so far, strike me as way, way wrong, this place and Piccolo Sogno. There are lots of tastier alternatives: For my money, you'd be much better-served to go to another restaurant on the list, anteprima, or its sister, smal-plates restaurant, just a couple doors south of anteprima.
