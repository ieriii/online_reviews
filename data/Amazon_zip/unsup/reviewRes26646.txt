I was craving for Vietnamese food during a visit in Chicago. After I found this place on Yelp and I took the subway to try it out. I've had a lot of authentic Vietnamese food and tried their shrimp papaya salad and one of the chef's recommendations, a stuffed pepper dish.  Cons: The food is definitely a little Americanized. I was the only Asian there during dinner time. The salad and entree are light and less flavorful than I'm used to. Pros: The decor is very nice for a restaurant in this price range. Service is good. Owner is especially nice. After I asked for more spice and hot sauce, he gave me a small bowl of fish sauce with crushed pepper, which totally turned the salad around to taste close to what I liked. You get a lot of food for the money. Owner is so kind and gave me a bonus sticky rice bun after learning that I came from out of town.  I'd definitely go back to try some other entrees of theirs. For appetizers, they have the traditional summer roll and tamarind soup that I'd like to try next. And just for the good service and pleasant atmosphere I'd recommend this to anyone wanting good Vietnamese food.
