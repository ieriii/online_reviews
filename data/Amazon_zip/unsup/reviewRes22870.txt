I have to say 4 because Hot Doug's is the real place. Excellent deal, this one. Love the pickled green tomatoe, crispy fries and excellent Superdawg, which is bigger and fatter, as well as has it's own spicing as it's custom made. And, the shakes are delicious. Which reminds me, I need a superdawg...
