Been here several times so this is a collaboration-- 4 stars for food & service. 2 1/2 stars for minimally decent looking guys (I was playing wing woman with not a lot to work with!) The mini cheeseburger was exceptionally full of flavor while the mini turkey burger was total garlic overload-and I LOVE garlic. The service was great: they brought a bowl of water for my dog before I even got any H20! Also offers a dog-friendly patio menu (basically rawhide, pig ear, doggy-burger.) Would have liked a pickle or two on the burgers -but I'm just sayin.... Wont say much about the dude scene other than its difficult for a group of late 20's, early 30's women to not feel cougartastic on a Friday/Saturday night.
