I give this place 5 stars for what kind of place it is, because it does what a lot of places are trying to be, but is the only one that succeeds. That being said... I can't imagine I'll ever be back...it's def a culinary, once in a lifetime experience that I don't see multiple visits being necessary, nor do I have much desire to go back. It for sure delivers on service, presentation, and taste, and is an incredible experience. The one thing I missed was that there were minimal greens...I am such a vegetable person and it was very heavy on potatoes. I recommend the tasting menu and doing the wine pairing. The sommelier had great tidbits to tell about the history of each kind of alcohol served, and added to the experience. Not a place for someone who isn't open-minded about food, because there are definitely some unique tastes...
