The staff was very pleasant and the location was nice; however our room was very cramped and somewhat awkward. This could perhaps be because I requested a corner room, but the view was just ok and it was very clausterphobic. The bathroom was very clean and modern with the stand up shower and rainhead attachment, but it did not overwhelm me. Don't expect to think you got a great deal with the lower room rate because the cost to valet your car.............$43 dollars/night. The final complaint is that I am pretty sure I got bed bugs from our bed. I have what looks like a rash along the upper part of my arm that is driving me crazy.  I do not recommend this hotel at all.
