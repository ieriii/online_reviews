Oh I really liked this place. The outside is so cute and the waiters are very nice on the inside. Also, and this is so silly, this is the first time I've been to a place that was BYOB. What an awesome way to drink! The portions are good, everything is flavorful and tastes fresh, and it's pretty reasonable. While the food is good, there's nothing really that stands out. I also don't think the guac (my favorite thing of ever) was all that great. Also, they don't take credit cards. A few minor quibbles, but nothing to stop me from going back.
