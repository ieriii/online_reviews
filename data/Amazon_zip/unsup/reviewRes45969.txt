Food = 3 stars, Service = 5 stars My husband & I were entertaining his family in Chicago over Father's Day weekend & we decided to go here for brunch. Their egg dishes are okay, nothing spectacular. Nookies has much better omelettes. But, their apple pancake is quite possible one of the best pancakes we've ever had. Service is great! The service staff always makes sure that your drinks are full & when my breakfast didn't come out with the rest of my party, the assistant manager personally stopped by to let us know of the delay & I got a free side of berries to munch on in the meantime, which I appreciated. Many props for that!
