This place is pretty awesome. I've been there a few times in both small and super large groups and have had excellent service both times.  We went for a birthday with a large group and they brought out a wonderful free dessert spread for everyone to taste. The best part about this place is that there's a personal touch. The chef sent us a handwritten note a month after our visit with a coupon. I'll be going back for sure.
