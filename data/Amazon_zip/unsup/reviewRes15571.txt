Ropa Vieja Arrachera (skirt steak, rice and beans, sweet onion, chimichurri sauce) Bistek Palomilla (Ribeye, smoked brisket mofongo, mushrooms, garlic-soy butter, radish salad) It's already been said but the service here is amazing. Granted I went on a Tuesday night and it was slower, but the staff is very friendly. Ropa Vieja of course was great. Arrachera was tasty too. Bistek Palomilla: this one was amazing. I've had some ribeyes in my life but this one takes the cake. I'm usually not big on toppings or sauces on steaks but had a perfect balance. The garlic-soy butter on the steak made the whole thing melt in your mouth. The brisket mofongo was also perfectly matched even though I have no idea what mofongo is. The radish salad also compliments and balances the whole thing out. I usually like to order different things when revisiting but I would order this one again. Only down side was that my steak was a bit stringy, but that's the nature of ribeyes. I now understand why this place is so popular and highly rated. Great service, food, decor, ambiance and location. They have all the bases covered.
