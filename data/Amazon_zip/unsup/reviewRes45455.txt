Gorgeous dark wood-trimmed restaurant with friendly staff. Their steak ceasar salad is SO delicious. I think the BEST I have ever had. They serve it wedge style with a quick sear on the grill which gives off some charred, smoky aromas. The dressing is TASTY. I have been here three times and I refuse to try anything else. Good beer selection. Sometimes the music is too loud. Service is great, efficient. Nice patio in the summer! Great for people watching!
