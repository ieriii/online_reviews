Fact: Piece is always overcrowded (in the eves) and crawling with obnoxious-types (hipsters, jocks, parents with unruly kids). Fact: service is spotty, starting with --and especially -- the host table. FACT: THIS IS THE BEST PIZZA IN CHICAGO. Fact: The beer is wonderful and worth every pricey penny. If you have no tolerance for crowds and noise and sometimes-rude service, this might not be the place for you. But I'd still encourage giving the to-go experience a shot. I go here, on average, once a week and can't get enough of their products: red pizza well done. Salad (the salad is a hidden gem. get it and you'll see) and golden arm. If Billy would have it, I'd want to open one of my own in my hometown....I know it would be a smashing success. Piece. Your orgasm awaits.
