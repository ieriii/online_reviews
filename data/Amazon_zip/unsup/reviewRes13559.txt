I have come here a number of times for brunch, dinner, and a company party. I have not been disappointed with any of my individual selections. They have very good beer (brewed on site) and food (great burgers and awesome brunch) offerings. I really like the hombre burger and Eugene porter. For my company outing, we were able to go on a brewery tour which was a lot of fun. We had a buffet style dinner which was just ok (I entered with fairly high expectations due to my previous experiences). It's definitely worth the stop if you're in the area.
