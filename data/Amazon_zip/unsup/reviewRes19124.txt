Excited to finally check out xoco! Pros - Pork torta (extra spicy) - Friendly staff - Cacao (1/2 milk 1/2 cacao) - Self serve sparkling water with lime Cons - Churros were covered in too much sugar (maybe ask for less sugar) - Very busy place, so had to come after lunch and before dinner rush hour Conclusion - Excited to go back and try other items (eyed someone's soup) and other cacao drinks.
