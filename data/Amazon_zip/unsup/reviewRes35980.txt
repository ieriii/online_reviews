I give @melicafejuice two thumbs up. I got the Hearty Scrambler of eggs, tomatoes, onions, bacon, and sausage. It was a large portion and very filling and delicious. I also got a strawberry, kiwi and orange juice - excellent. They have a wide variety of juices and smoothies in their juice bar. Someone near my table got an oatmeal smoothie which sounded gross at first. When I looked up this concoction in the menu it actually sounded yummy (oatmeal, skim milk, honey, whipped cream I think). I would love to try more from their juice bar. The restaurant itself was very pleasant. At 7:30 am about half the place was full. It's very clean and welcoming with cool artwork on the walls and fresh flowers on the tables. Our waitress was attentive, and we didn't have to wait long for our food. The lights went out about halfway through our meal, but we were near a window so it didn't affect us much. A hostess came over to apologize, which I think is pretty cool. They obviously care about their patrons. I'd highly recommend Meli's to anyone looking for a nice breakfast spot. $42 plus tip for 2 people
