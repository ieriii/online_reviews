Worst hotel experience EVER!!! Rooms were small yet cozy, however, the staff could use a lesson or two on manners,decency and customer service. When I called to speak with a manager and explained my issues, he flat out told me I'm not the first one to make a complaint like this and about a specific "security" employee who has treated other guests similar...yet they still allow this behavior. Very poor management. I highly recommend staying at one of the more larger established hotels instead of The Dana. It definately was NOT worth the money that was spend to be treated so ignorantly. It was my first experience there and will absolutely be my last. If you plan on booking a room at The Dana, I strongly suggest looking elsewhere. The city has plenty of other great hotels who treat their guests with respect. I'm extremely disappointed.
