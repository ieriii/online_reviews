Delicious food - we went on Friday night and only had a 15 minute wait and enjoyed our meal immensely! The starter of the "spicy cabbage" was incredible. I had never had that before - both my wife and I joked that we could make a whole meal of it. We were battling each other with our chopsticks to get the last few bites. ;) For appetizers we weren't adventurous and went with potstickers and egg rolls - both were perfectly executed and the egg rolls were crisp and not greasy. We had the sizzling rice soup and the (if I remember right) mushrooms in oyster sauce for our main dishes. Both were tasty but the mushrooms blew us away - they used five different types of mushrooms and the sauce was perfectly seasoned so as to not overwhelm the delicate flavor of the mushrooms. We will be back...
