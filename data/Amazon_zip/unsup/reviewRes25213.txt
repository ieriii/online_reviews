I never really liked deep dish pizza because the crust is waaaaayyy too thick and not much filling. Zachary's in the bay area made me like deep dish pizza, I figured I just had really bad ones (BJ's and the like). I was in Chicago not too long ago and we had to come here because it's voted one of the best deep dishes in town. And I concur, it was AMMMMAAAZIIINNNGGGG. I don't even know how to describe that taste, it definitely hit the umami level. You just have to try it for yourself, it's really hard to explain. They use very fresh ingredients and are not cheap with it. The sausage pieces are GINORM!!! The bread is actually thin and crispy, it's alllll filling!!! yey! If i could add another star, I would, for the whale that wears a thong over its head.
