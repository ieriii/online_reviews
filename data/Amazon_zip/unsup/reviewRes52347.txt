When I went to Ginos East, I ordered a Chicken Cobb Salad. This was really good, but what keeps on bringing me back is their Garlic Bread sticks with homemade ranch and marinara sauce. My boyfriend ordered the well known "sausage patty" pizza. He didn't melt over it like he has other things, but it wasn't disappointing either. The second time I got a regular deep dish cheese pizza and it was good too. I did enjoy the service the first time, but the second time, we had to file a complaint.
