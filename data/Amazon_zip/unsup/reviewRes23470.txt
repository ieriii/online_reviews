Good food, but not as impressed as I thought I would be because of the reviews. Egg Roll: fresh and not too oily.  Mongolian Beef: I'm a mushroom lover, so the fresh large mushrooms in the dish was what sold me. Just like the egg rolls not too oily. Juicy and moderatly tender beef strips.  Staff was very attentive and friendly.
