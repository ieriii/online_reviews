The Diner was always a good stand-by when I lived in Chicago. I would eat here at least twice a month. That being said, the food is pretty good, but if there were better all-veg options in Chicago, I would have probably been going to them more often. The Seitanic Caesar Salad (now renamed Chickin Caesar Salad) was my fave, followed by an okay (but nothing to write home about) macro plate (which looks like is no longer on the menu). They have a decent brunch, although there is usually a pretty long line.
