Food: Typically delicious but has lost it's flare as it's grown up! Would highly recommend other establishments for much more authentic sit down experience. If you're looking for a quick fix of Cuban food and a great open space outside, be ready for a wait on space and time. The staff is very courteous, clean presentation. Would go back on that weekday when you're in the mood for a nice stroll to lighten the burden of the heavy calorie intake!
