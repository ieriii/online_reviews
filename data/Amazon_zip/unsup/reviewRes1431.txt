Be ready for a long wait. Also realize they close at 4:30 (not sure if they have someone that cuts off the line or what). They are also closed on Sunday. It's pretty cool they have duck fat fries, they are good but not the best fries you will every have, and you can only get them on Friday and Sat. Every dog I have had is amazing! Doug is really nice and seems more then happy to help you pick out a dog even after you have been standing by the menu for ten minutes. You have to make a visit, but be ready to spend a couple hours.
