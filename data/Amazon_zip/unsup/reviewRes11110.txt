Saturday night is a good time to visit - karaoke supported by a live band. It gets really loud at the tables right in front of the stage (can't really talk to your neighbor), but when there's no karaoke, the place is great for hanging out and catching up with friends. The hefeweizen is great, as is the pizza. Definitely going back.
