I live a block away from Uncommon Ground and it took me two years to walk into the place. The menu price is simply prohibitive for a quick eat. Press for time, the girlfriend and I decided to have a quick breakfast at the Devon location. First observation, the place is beautiful, elegant without being pretentious. Second, very sincere level of attention from the staff. Third, the price was in the mid 30's for what is basically: 4 eggs, one asparagus stalk, two pieces of bacon, one slice of bread, 2 ounces of spinach, one cup of coffee, and an orange juice. At this price level, I was extremely disappointed for the eggs were overcooked, the asparagus were tasteless, and to a get a single slice of toast!!! Come on. I didn't eat my meal (out of principle) and the poor waiter comped my breakfast (which I did not ask him to do). There are a lof of people who are just absolutely in-loved with this place. But I do have to ask one basic question: Why are you paying so much for mediocrity?
