To say I love this place is an understatement! My first time here (probably 6 years ago) I was with my aunt and uncle who are wine connoisseurs. They informed me that good wine does not come from a box. Amen to that. Bin 36 was my first restaurant where I didn't order anything on my own. I gave my waiter an idea of what I liked and didn't liked, and he ran with it from there. A great way to try new foods? Put your trust in a trained server who knows their stuff! I'm a White Flights kinda girl, but am open to Red Flights if I'm feeling frisky. You've got quite a selection to choose from. Don't be afraid to try a few! There is something to be said of an establishment where the staff knows the correct food/wine pairings. I was here with my girlfriend last night, and all we told our bartender was we loved cheese, but our only restriction was it couldn't be 'stinky'. He brought us 5 different types and it was a perfect selection! Great place to unwind after work, but also a perfect date place! Looking forward to many more fun nights out at Bin 36!
