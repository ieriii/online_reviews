If your willing to make the trek up north...this place is a good one. The mussels are excellent and if you are a beer lover, this would be the place. Only complaints...The service I've had (sitting at the bar) was not impressive. Kind of rude! Tried to go last night (Saturday), around 6:30 and the bar was packed and very smokey, we ended up leaving.
