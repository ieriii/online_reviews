Great Chai Tea Latte! I also enjoyed my black and white cookie... two worlds coexisting on one delicious cookie. Cool study lounge next door to the bakery as well. I saw a giant Cookie Monster cake being given to a customer and I was amazed at the level of detail on it! This is the place to buy fun cakes that is for sure!
