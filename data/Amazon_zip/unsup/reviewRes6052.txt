Probably my favorite restaurant in Chicago! I know that is hard to believe with all of the great steakhouses but they have delicious dishes at half the price. The waitstaff is great and the cooks are even better. They have the best mashed potatoes in Chicago and don't even think about leaving without trying the RASPBERRY COSMO. It may be the most delicious drink I have ever had. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!
