Everyone gave this hotel rave reviews, but it has a dark side. Right next to those nice rooms they have a lot of crappy Motel 6 rooms too. I booked through Expedia and I was treated as such. Check in was advertised, (I also called the night before), at 2 and I had to wait two hours for a room. The woman at the front desk said they would call me when my room was ready, but they never did. I got to the room and it is quite obvious I am not viewed as a customer akin to there normal clientel because I booked for a reduced rate. First of all my room smells like a dog. It is really small, I have stayed at Holiday Inns that are larger. There is a maintenance door to the air conditioner in my room and the door doesn't stay closed so they proped a seven foot mirror up against it and called it modern decor. There isn't a desk in the room either just a little table and a shabby low back bench. I don't doubt that they have nice rooms here but be warned there are also some nasty rooms included.
