My wife and I went here for the first time and were blown away. The crepes were simple and delicious. I had never had a crepe with veges before so I was a little apprehensive, but I am now a believer. We live in Andersonville, and plan on putting Icosium in our heavy rotation. The vege soup that came with our crepes was awesome and so was the sweet crepe at the end. We had caramel with toasted almonds.
