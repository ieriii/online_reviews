This place is decent enough. I was happy to see that in the midst of their souther comfort/bbq dishes they managed to fit in more than a handful of vegetarian items. I got the black bean cakes, with mashed sweet potatoes and sauteed spinach. Everything was pretty good, nothing stood out to me though. The service was slow, and it was really quite in general. I would go here again, but probably not anytime soon.
