I give this place five stars for the ambience, varied menu options and delicious hand-crafted beers. Enjoy the pizzas, burgers, mussels and the recent addition of homemade soft pretzels and cheese! It can be difficult to find seating here and only expect to be seated at a table if you're dining in. Weekday lunches are the prime time for rapid seating and great service. I've also enjoyed chatting with the bartenders during their downtime. Overall, a yummy experience! A successful addition to Logan Square!
