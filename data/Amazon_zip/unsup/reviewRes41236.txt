Personal favorite. Took my Mom for her birthday. Had last minute reservations and everything was flawless and timely. The staff was so nice and friendly. The food is delectable also. Everytime someone new addressed our table they wished my Mom a Happy Birthday! Nice touch! :) They even drizzled Happy Birthday on her plate of cake in chocolate. One thing that did sort of irk me was that she had the Classic (which already included a dessert) and when I placed my reservation- though last minute, they told me the bday cake would be complimentary...When the tab came they charged $3.50 for the cake- a "birthday" charge- must have been to cover the cost of the candle... Blank Stare...They have to lose a star for this! Other than that, everything was nice. I prefer to sit upstairs, so I should have asked to be moved... I fancy the stuffed chicken and its always so tasty! I love the flavor and the butter! Yummy!!! I did notice the (new?!) vast diversity of the crowd.... I will def be back!
