Went last night for the first time with a date, called the day before to make reservations and when we got there we were greeted by a kind host who took our coats and and seated us ASAP. The restaurant was slam packed, full to capacity. The server was great and attentive, the food was fantastic, as an Italian who grew up on grandma's homemade Pasta, this was great. The menu changes every week or so, so it is good to point out that menus you find online may not match. I do need to mention that the restaurant is small so if you can request seating against the wall you will have a better time. All the tables are right on top of each other which adds to the character of the restaurant. Everyone I saw was enjoying themselves except for the uppity snot nose table behind us who had issues with the poor bus boy bumping one of their chairs. I looked the idiot was seated way out of the table he refused to push his seat in, so he deserved it.  I recommend it and will definitely go back
