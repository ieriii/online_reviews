I came to Nana for a friend's birthday dinner and was very impressed. It was a warm and welcoming atmosphere with exposed brick walls and cool paintings. The service was pretty good for a large group, bonus points for that Nana! If you're not bringing your own booze (Nana is BYOB) I highly recommend trying their sodas, particularly the grapefruit one. I also had the mac&cheese as an app, half order of the fried quail, and a side order of the garlic mashed potatoes. Let me just say that I love how Nana re-imagines comfort food here. Their mac & cheese wasn't too cheesy, but it reminded me of butter noodles a friend's Croatian grandmother used to make. The garlic mashed potatoes were great too. Oh...the quail. Even though I was wearing a nice dress, i didn't hesitate to rip that little bird apart and gnaw on its tiny bones for the meat. It was delicious! It's also served with wilted greens and biscuits & gravy, so when all the fried bits mix with everything else its pretty much heaven. I had a tough time picking out what I was going to order because Nana's menu has such a variety. I guess I'll have to come back for brunch AND dinner now yay!
