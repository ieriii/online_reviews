In college, I would go to a place called Papa Del's (in Champaign) for amazing deep dish pizza. They served quality ingredients (especially the sauce....oooooh the sauce) and it was always worth the wait. I lived in Chicago one summer and tried a bunch of deep dish pizzas (Pizzeria Due, Giordano's, Lou Milnati's, etc), but didn't like ANY of them.  Eating at all of those places seriously made me long for Papa Del's. Well, I'm out of college and I moved to New York, but whenever I visit Chicago, my friend, Brian, stuffs me with all kinds of Chicago-style food. One place he introduced me to, Pequods, reminds me of Papa Del's, and, dare I say it, might be BETTER than Papa Del's! They have a deep dish pizza that has a caramelized crust (they put parmesan around the crust before putting it in the oven). The pizza has just the right amount of everything; it's not just a thin crust pizza with an inch of gloppy cheese (like SOME Chicago pizzerias). I asked about shipping pizzas from Pequods to New York, but it was too expensive (dry ice, overnight shipping, etc) I suppose I'll fly to Chicago anytime I have a craving :)
