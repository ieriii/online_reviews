I had previously been to Topolabampo and Xoco (which are Rick Bayless's other restaurants at the same location) my expectations were high since the other two restaurants were soooo amazing. I was with a party of 8 and what really aggravated me was the fact that we were charged for extra chips and salsa (which are greatly overpriced), I just think that if a party is spending almost $1000 on dinner, you could afford to throw in some chips for free. Also, we ordered 1 queso, received 2 and were charged for 2. The steak was grizzly and unexciting. We made reservations 2 months in advance (if you just walk in you'll probably have a 2-3 hour wait), paid too much for parking and were given an obscenely large bill for just ok food.  I recommend skipping Frontera Grill, but if you have to get your Rick Bayless fix try Topolabampo (super pricey but an amazing experience) or Xoco (sandwiches, soups, everyday food - good bang for your buck).
