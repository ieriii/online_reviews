Oh, Gage, you saucy minx. You're the perfect place to bring out of towners. When someone coming into Chicago asks where they should get drinks downtown, I recommend this place. The drinks and the food are really outstanding, and there's something for everyone. It IS pricey, but it's also fancypants food/drinks on prime real estate. I've gotten the fish and chips here, which were pretty delicious. Crispy, greasy fish with tangy tarter sauce...just perfect. It's even served in folded up newspapers. The wine is expensive (~12 a glass to start), but you also get a buttload of wine. It evens out, I suppose. It gets loud in here, but after a drink (or two), it's fine. This place is one of the few non touristy places near the bean, and you will catch a lot of locals as well as out of towners at the Gage.
