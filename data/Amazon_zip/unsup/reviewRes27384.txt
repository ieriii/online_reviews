After my first two attempts to eat here were thwarted by ridiculously long lines, I was excited to finally snag a table here (after only a 10-min. wait). They serve chips along with two different homemade salsas, both of which are pretty good-- I give them an 8 out of 10. They also serve you homemade chicken soup before your meal, and each table gets a bowl of spicy pickled carrots and jalapenos. By the time the meal came, my expectations were pretty high. The actual meal, though, left me baffled at why this place is so popular. The tacos I had featured steak that was overcooked and rubbery. It's not even that cheap to eat here, since they don't have an a-la-carte menu. With all of those appetizer freebies, I'd have been fine with just two tacos, but I had to get the taco plate. The long line outside of this place makes it seem like something special, but it's less tasty, and more expensive, than the many wonderful tacquerias in this city that you can just walk into with no wait.
