Belgian beer heaven - this alone gets it 6 stars. so many to choose from it is absolutely ridiculous especially being a big belgian fan. Its always really crowded and the food is really overrated even the mussles which are advertised like they are the best in the world. But with a beer selection like they have however, they can pretty much fail every other category and get 4 stars from me. But nothing fails, the food is still ok, its just not great. Wish i could give 4.5 stars because in my opinion, this is what the place deserves. 4.5
