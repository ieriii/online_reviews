OMG!!!! Is all I can say. I want to first thank Chef Mike and the staff for such a wonderful experience. I was there for brunch on Saturday 04/07/12 for a friends birthday, however I had dietary restrictions that included No meat, dairy, starch, or sugar. The chef came out and personally showed me what I could have from each station and created 3 additional dishes for me to eat. I felt like it was my birthday with how attentive they were to my needs. All of the food was absolutely outstanding hence the rants and raves all around the table. Just when I thought I would be very limited, I left more satisfied than anyone else. Can't wait to return!!
