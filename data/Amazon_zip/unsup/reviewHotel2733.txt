The James Hotel is one of the best boutique hotels I've stayed at... The hotel is modern, SLEEK and sexy with lots of toys to play with in every room! Hello, there were 2 flat screen tvs, an iPod ready stereo, good sized Kiehl's toiletries (I love Kiehl's!), a great mini bar (not free, of course) and really really comfortable bed. The king-size bed itself was worth our stay here. I almost felt guilty for messing up the pristinely made bed, which was so wonderfully plush and soft. The entire hotel is minimalist but cool. Service was phenomenal, too. Staff was super attentive at every turn and felt like I received celebrity-worthy treatment here. I only stayed one night at The James but I would love to stay here again!
