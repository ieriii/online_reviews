whoa....what happened to Garcia's?! My boyfriend and I were over in Lincoln Square a few weeks ago and went by Garcia's and had to take a double look. What happened to the small, dark and crowded restaurant I knew? It was no longer there. Instead over the winter they transformed it to a larger, cleaner and brighter place! We both said we had to come back STAT! So we did....and it's the same except for the few upgrades mentioned above. Yes, love the extra seating and tables not so cramped together. Also they re-painted and it seems they made the ceiling taller? The food is still as good as ever and the prices have not changed either. Only thing that hasn't changed that I wish would....the service. Prompt at taking your order, but after that they become no shows. Bus-boy always re-filled our water glasses and the one time our waitress stopped by she didn't even notice my b/f's empty coke glass. They need to upgrade the service here, which is why I usually just order take-out. But very glad they finally re-modeled the place...it needed it!! Even more glad the food is just as tasty!
