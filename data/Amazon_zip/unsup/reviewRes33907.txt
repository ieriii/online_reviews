I was really excited about this place: friends told me it was cheap, good and across the street from my temporary digs. And I am all about someone else making my lunch and not having to go too far to fetch it. And it was almost as my friends promised: very close, yes, and inexpensive but in no way the best Med grub I've ever had. Hummus was bland, and while I appreciate a non-greasy falafel I'd rather have mine with a bit more flavor, please. Baba-ganush was quite good though. Will go back for the salad bar for it did look very good.
