Probably some of the best 'Za I've had in Chicago. White with shrooms and spinach, any red, bbq chix or the special clams and bacon. All good stuff. However.....I am not crazy about the brews they beer there. Fortunately, they have some really good stuff (read: Alpha King) on their 'guest taps'. Also, an underrated place to watch a game.
