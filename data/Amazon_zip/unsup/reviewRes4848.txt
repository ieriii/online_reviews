Came here awhile ago, but loved it so much that I made my boyfriend (at the time) take me there again. The place is a bit too trendy for me, and the menu is very trendy as well. HOWEVER what you should keep in mind--do not order the sliced meat, you pretty much get three slices of pepperoni for $15. Not worth it at all. But what I loved was the spreads, and my favorite dish was the balsamic pork tail (I think this is what it was). You absolutely have to order this if you come, because honestly this dish, on its own, would warrant me to fly back to Chicago and go here.
