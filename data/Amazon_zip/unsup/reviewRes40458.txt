This place has gone from good, to so-so, to downright disgusting. Last time I was here, their steak was flavorless and rubbery, the tomatos in everything were extremely underripe, and I literally couldn't eat the chorizo, it was so gross. I felt nauseous after my meal. I retract my previous statement; I WOULD take my chances with an anonymous hole-in-the-wall taqueria over La Pasadita. Completely. I've totally learned my lesson and I won't be back.
