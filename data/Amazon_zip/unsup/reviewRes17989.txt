Bad Apple... you may be a new favorite indulgence. My boyfriend went to Bad Apple on a Saturday night around 6pm and were seated immediately. Not many places that you can expect that at. Overwhelmed by our choices of beer and cocktails (which isn't a bad thing) our waitress let us take our time deciding on a drink, but we immediately put in an order for cheese curds. These were absolutely delicious. Crunchy on the outside and gooey cheese on the inside. However, we were served our app before we even ordered our drinks which was kind of frustrating. Although we took a little while, when we did decide our waitress didn't come back for a good 10 minutes and by that point we were ready to order our food as well. For our burgers, I ordered the peppered kraut and my boyfriend ordered the hangover. I absolutely loved my burger, expect when it said bacon I was expecting bacon on my burger not bits inside. The meat was juicy, not dry at all and my toppings didn't overwhelm the burger. My boyfriend on the other hand felt overwhelmed that he couldn't even taste half of the extra toppings. He liked it but wasn't impressed. Neither of us enjoyed the fries. Tasteless and the "seasonings" were not worth the extra .75 cents spent. Drinks: I being a cocktail kinda girl ordered the Pouty Pear and loved it! Absolutely would order it again. My boyfriend got the Kapittel Blonde and like any other Belgium beer, he loved it. We planned on trying more beers but due to our slow service by the waitress we never got a chance to order more drinks. Pros: Great atmosphere, good burgers, awesome drinks, food is quickly delivered Cons: Fries were awful, we may have just had a bad waitress... but our busboy helped us out more than our actual waitress We'll probably go back since we live nearby!
