Okay, I think I made myself too excited about this place. The seating was great but the food not so much.  I ordered the blacken catfish with red beans and rice and collard greens. The fish was okay not the best but the side were good. My friend ordered the blacken chicken with red beans and rice and spinach. He said the chicken was super dry and the spinach had way to much vinegar.  The drink that I had was the best thing going for the place. I ordered some kind of champagne martini. If you go there you have to try it. Overall, the wait staff was great the food not so much. It's a great place to go if you want a quiet place with different food, I guess.
