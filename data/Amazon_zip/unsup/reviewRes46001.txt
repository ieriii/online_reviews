I've only been to Cheesecake Factory once but it was an enjoyable meal. The same cannot be said for my experience at Grand Lux Cafe. The dinner started off well with a cool seat overlooking Michigan Avenue and we both enjoyed the Asian Nachos. Unfortunately, it was downhill from there. On an apparently chicken binge, we ordered the Crispy Caramel Chicken and the Pan Roasted Chicken Breast. They were both dry, bland, and generally unappetizing. Even the accompanying vegetables/rice were unsatisfactory. To top it off, our waiter was pretty inattentive and I had a strange desire to introduce his face to my fist. I'll be going back to Cheesecake Factory but Grand Lux Cafe will not be getting a return visit.
