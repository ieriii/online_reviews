I don't really remember the disappointing burrito I had at Irazu because all I ever get anymore is the empanadas. Someday when I do not live in Chicago anymore I will have dreams about those empanadas and be inexplicably cranky for the next few meals. The one time I got the sweet plantains they were pretty dry and mealy, but that might have been an off day, I don't know. I love those empanadas enough that I will forgo plantains to eat them, which says a lot, at least in my book.
