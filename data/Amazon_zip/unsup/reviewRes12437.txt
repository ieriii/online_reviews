not your signature chicago deep-dish pizza. this brewery & restaurant in wicker park serves up thin crust pies with interesting toppings. we got a plain with clams & bacon paired with their award-winning hand-crafted brews. so good and tasty but getting our stuffed bellies back home in the torrential downpour was not as fun.
