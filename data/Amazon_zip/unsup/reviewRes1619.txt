I had been here once before on a Saturday & waited for over an hour for the delicious dogs. This time I went on a Monday afternoon thinking I could avoid the line...WRONG!!! Still waited about 35mins but hey, the wait is worth it! I had the Teuben: corned beef sausage with Russian dressing, sauerkraut and Swiss cheese) and the Turducken sausage with smokey bacon sauce , venison pate and mustard seed Gouda cheese.  The Turducken seemed to be a popular choice. I kept hearing people order it. The sausage alone was tasty, but throw the sauce, cheese AND venison on top of that...OMG...amazing! I did, however, enjoy the Teuben a bit more. I love sauerkraut and I think it went perfect with the dressing & swiss. Get that TEUBEN!!! The cheese fries on the side was "frosting on the cake!!!" Doug was working the counter like the last time I was there. The guy is so nice. His employees are friendly as they walk around with smiles, greeting hungry patrons & asking everyone how it was at the end of the meal. They can even read your mind & ask you if you want to pack up what you can't finish before you can ask them. Are you patient? Can you bear the wait? If so, definitely hit up Hot Doug's ASAP!!! P.S. Not sure if it's true, but I heard if you head there around 345ish on weekdays, you won't wait.
