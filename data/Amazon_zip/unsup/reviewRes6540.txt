The food was OK, the service was decent. This isn't a bad place by any means, but I would recommend going to either Joe's or Shaw's before going to Wildfire. It has a strong chain restaurant vibe, good for upscale business lunches / business trip dinners. Nothing special that I would take out of town company to or to celebrate any special events. I'm in no rush to go back.
