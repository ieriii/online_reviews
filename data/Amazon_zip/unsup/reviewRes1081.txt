I'm not a huge fan of sausage, but I will admit that I enjoyed my fare at the infamous Hot Doug's! I came for a late lunch on a weekday, so there was no line outside. We waited maybe 10 minutes to give our order and less than 5 for our food. My husband had the foie gras duck sausage and I had the onion and cheddar pork sausage with caramelized onions and garlic cheese. We also split a large cheese fry - duck fat fries only on Fri and Sat! The food was very good, but not out of this world. The portions seemed small at first, but we were definitely full for a long time. My sausage was very moist and tasty, but came with a little too much cheese. Overall, our only complaints were that it was a little pricey and cash only. While I wouldn't mind returning to try other menu items, I don't know that I'd wait in a long line outside...
