Paul Kahan is a pork GOD. If you go to Publican, try to only go with one or two other people so you can sit at the huge communal table rather than a private booth. The oysters are just so fresh and amazing. If you're new to good oysters, get the chef's selection. I prefer the West Coast oysters. They're smaller and sweeter than East Coast oysters which tend to be large and a little saltier. I wasn't really a fan of the pork rinds, but the bone marrow is truly incredible. The beer selection is excellent and the staff is pretty knowledgeable about them.
