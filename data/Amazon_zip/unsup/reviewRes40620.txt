Extra money for everything beyond the meat, cilantro, onions and salsa? Are you kidding La Pasadita? Two bucks more a burrito than Picante but without any of the other stuff? You have to be kidding. 50 cents for cheese? Please. When I go for a burrito and horchata I want to spend 7 bucks MAX. Sure, I'll be back when I'm drunk and not as fiscally responsible but I'm disappointed in you.
