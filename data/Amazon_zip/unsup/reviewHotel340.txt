Nothing special here... about $110 a night for a queen bed, with $10/night for Wifi, provided by an outside vendor. Next time I'm there, I think I'll try to stay a bit north of the Loop, but as it was, there was a decent amount of stuff around here, and the Red Line stops a block away. This is also within walking distance to Museum Campus, Buckingham Fountain, & Millennium Park, so it's got that going for it. The rooms themselves were perfectly clean and everything. Like I said, nothing particularly special, but perfectly acceptable for my three night stay.
