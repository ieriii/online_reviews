The food is delicious, but you need to be in the mood for a very lively atmosphere. My boyfriend and I went to The Publican for a last minute birthday reservation and I hadn't mentioned to him that the seating is family style. We were both surprised to be seated wedged in between a large party of 6 and what can only be described as an awkward 1st date. The beer list is great and you can't go wrong with any pork product on the menu, but the service wasn't the best. The sea bass and the beer I ordered were both sold out (on a Tuesday night?) and I would have enjoyed a little more direction from the server when I asked for a similar beverage.  Overall, everything we ate was tasty, but don't expect a romantic dinner. I'll have to go back to try the brunch. Maybe this time I'll go early to ensure that everything I want to order is available.
