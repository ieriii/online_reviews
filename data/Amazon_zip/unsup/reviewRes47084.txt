My girlfriend and I went on a Saturday night, at about 9:00, and we only had to wait for maybe 20 minutes and we didn't call before hand. While we waited we sat in the bar/lounge area and we knew we liked the place just from sitting in there. They have really good priced beers, and a lot of them on tap,
