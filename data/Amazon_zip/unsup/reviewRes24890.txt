I really do love this place. We decided to grab a frappe and some appetizers for dinner. While our food is coming out, I smelled the augolemono soup, yum! It's egg lemon chicken rice soup. Bring out one of those too please. So delish. Saved room for dessert, had the hazelnut cake. Very decadent. We also had to take home desserts from the bakery section. The prices are a little on the higher side for the specialty items but well worth it since they take pride in their desserts and bakery items. Yum again.  Service is always with a smile and very prompt and attentive. Overall, great place to hang and have a nice meal, and conversation with a single friend or a whole gang of them.
