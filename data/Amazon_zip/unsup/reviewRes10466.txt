"Surrender, Surrender, but don't give yourself away..." I'm sorry Piece, I just won't surrender to your, uh, "charms". Is it charming that one gives their name for a long wait and a physical description of the person is taken, then you come around shouting names in our ears at the bar during the wait trying to find them? Is it charming that the bar area feels like 50 of your not-so-closest friends are elbow to elbow, crowded around a keg in the basement of a Frat House? Is it charming that the place is so loud one has to shout to be heard and you're seated so close to other diners that they listen in on your conversation? How about if you catch them rolling their eyes at things they shouldn't be listening to in the first place? Is it charming that all the workers at PIece look extremely annoyed and overworked and under appreciated? I just get the feeling that a different "system" is needed for the sanity of everyone involved; your customers AND your employees. Rick Nielsen, would it hurt you to get a few more guitars to put up on the walls? I mean, that one triple guitar hanging in the rafters looks like an afterthought. Of course, it's probably also getting dripped on by condensation from the windows above. I know we were! Make a real investment in your restaurant investment! I will say though, that your Worryin' Ale deserved whatever World Cup of Beers award that it won! It was so nice, I ordered it twice! The "red" style, traditional pizza was crap. I shoulda stuck with the white pizza. There's way better thin crust in Chicago now, but the Cool Kids are too lazy to try and find it. You've been put on warning, Piece: You're Not All Alright!
