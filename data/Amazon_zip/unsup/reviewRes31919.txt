If you ever thought vegan food couldn't satisfy your taste buds, you'll leave this place considering becoming a vegan. The food we had (curry/sweet potato burger & reuben w/ vegan cheese sandwich) were simply plate cleaning good. Everything from the mac-n-"cheeze" side to the lentil curry soup was good. And don't forget the milkshake for dessert. This is one place I'll be bringing my friends and family back to for a long time. Go for lunch during the week to avoid a wait.
