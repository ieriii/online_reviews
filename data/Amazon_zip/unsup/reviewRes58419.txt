I tried to go here for dinner with my family around 6pm this evening. The group included 3 adults and 2 kids, 1 needing a high chair. The host refused to seat us at any of the 4 tops available stating that it would be a fire hazard to have a high chair at any of them. There were several available. He even had the nerve to tell me go home and put your kids to bed then come back without them to eat! Are you kidding me!?! I have been here several time before but after being treated so rudely I will not go back! Why not just post a sign on the door NO KIDS ALLOWED!
