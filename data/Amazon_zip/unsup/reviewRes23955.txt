If you are a foodie and love never-ending platters of food be served to you, this is the place to go - for hot pot that is. And if you don't know what hot pot is, you are definitely missing out and need to try it here. (Btw, it is the food version of fondue). The waiters and waitresses were always really nice and attentive at the times I have been there - constantly watching out to see if we need more food, water, tea or need to change out propane cans for the portable stove. They also validate your parking, which is a real plus because street parking is a pain in Chinatown.
