Let me put it this way...... the most ORGASMIC BURGERS ON THE PLANET!!! I don't eat burgers very often but when I do I want it to be medium rare... and I mean rare. NOT medium. On top of it I want to be able to taste the quality of the meat and my toppings. Bad Apple met my burger expectations and then went above and beyond with there extensive beer list and unique, home service and atmosphere. I got the Edmund Fig-Gerald and my friend go the Hangover. I don't think either of us spoke for minutes and we were too involved in our food! I have been bragging about this place for weeks... You have to go! You will love it!
