This place was awesome! Well except for the weird order they have the channels but besides that it's great. Great prices, great locations and sometimes even a great view. They even provide breakfast....your usual but still it's FREE! (the water boiled scrambled eggs taste like phone wire) but besides that I LOVED it. They were courteous at all times and even provided menus for all activities. I would so go there again...even though I have my own apartment in Chicago!
