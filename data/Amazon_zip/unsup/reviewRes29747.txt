Let me begin by saying that I am a huge meat eater, and was taken here by my vegetarian friends who raved about this place. I have to say I was completely small minded, and came here wanting to challenge the idea of the no meat concept.   In my attempts to do so, I ordered what I thought would be the hardest things to make meatless. The buffalo wings, and a meatball sub. Really, please show me a meatless meatball sub! So I was completely blown away by both dishes. Like to the point where i've had a hundred meat meatball subs that couldn't hold a candle to the one I was served here.  The Chicago Diner has completely changed my attitude towards vegetarian food in general, and I look forward to taking my extremely carnivorous friends in here to see the shock on their faces.
