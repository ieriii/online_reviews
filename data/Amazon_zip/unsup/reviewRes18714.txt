I love this place! The food is unbelievable. Well, I should say the gnocci is unbelievable because I order it every time. And the bread that they bring out while you're waiting with garlic and oil and parmesan cheese is so good! Be careful not to fill up on bread though because the portions are pretty big. This place is also BYOB and there is no corkage fee. The only drawback is that this place gets busy fast, and the wait during their peak hours is about an hour. I usually try to get there before 7, to avoid the wait.
