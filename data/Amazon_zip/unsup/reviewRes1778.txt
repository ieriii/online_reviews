The line is a little out of control - and being my first time in chicago i decided i'd keep it traditional and order it chicago style. i loved the soft steamed bun, and all the typical chi-town style toppings, but was it worth the 3.5hour wait in the cold??? im not sure. I think its a better spot to get gourmet style burgers rather than traditional, and if i could guess why it takes so long id say a part of it would be the guy at the register who was super chatty with everyone ( whcih was very nice and refreshing, dont get me wrong.... )but hey, when you have a line thats wrapped around the corner i THINK you could afford to not chat it up with everyone and maybe get a 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th register...just a thought.
