A group of five went here on a Friday at 7. We made reservations, but it really wasn't necessary, although the place was filling up around the time we finished. For 5, we ordered two messobs and it was the perfect amount of food. We had a nice mix of vegetarian and meat portions. I gave the honey wine a try and i'm not sure I would get it again, but it was worth a taste. The service was great! Decor wasn't creepy. We'll be back!
