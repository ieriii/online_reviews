oh. my. god. SO DELICIOUS! after finding our way inside on a freezing blustery day, we were told the wait was close to 45 minutes. we were hungry but figured long wait/packed restaurant= good food! and boy were we right. we checked out some local stores for about 25 min, then checked back in-- our table was ready in 30. nice! fiance had the breakfast burrito, and i had a different burrito with black beans and sweet potatoes. they were amazing. i mean just delicious. the salsa and sour cream they came with were delish, and the home fries? mmm mmm! crispy potato goodness. bongo room has TONS of sweet brunch items, and the best part is you can order one piece instead of a whole order, so fiance did the banana oreo pancake and I had some sort of brioche french toast with pears and cream. holy wow. they were so good. totally decadent, so plan an extra hour or two at the gym to compensate. service was good, place was a bit cramped but the food was great. we will definitely be back!
