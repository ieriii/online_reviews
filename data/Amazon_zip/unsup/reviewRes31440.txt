It seems like a lot of others are raving about this place, and for good reason. I went to Mastro's for dinner last week and was very impressed by the food and the service. Our waitress was super helpful and knowledgeable. We did the "build your own raw seafood tower" and she explained the different oyster and crab options that they had available for the evening. There were a lot of options, and she seemed to effortlessly explain each in detail.  The steaks were great, and the lobster mashed potatoes were well worth their price tag. I also loved how when you ordered a martini, they shook it at the table and left the shaker with you. Ordering 1 martini is really like ordering 3, because I still was able to fill up my glass a few more times. I'd definitely go back to Mastro's again and again!
