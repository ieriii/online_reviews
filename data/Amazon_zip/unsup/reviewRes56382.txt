Recently Simply It catered to my party. It was amazing!Ordering with the owner Tuan was very easy, I just told him what I wanted, the day I wanted it and got a total. A few days later, as promised the food came on time, fresh and ready to eat. All the finger foods like eggrolls, spring rolls, and salads were delicious.I also got a tray of beef and asparagus, and also had the sate shrimp made for us as well. With enough chicken fried rice to cover those two entrees. My guests loved it, I loved it and I definitely love Simply It.
