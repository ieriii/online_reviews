I've had a few run-ins with Garcias over the past month or so and I think I'm finally ready to spill my guts and talk about my feelings. Get your therapist hat on, this might be a long session... My first visit was a "let's order carry out and watch movies instead of going out" situation. In retrospect, considering the level of wine consumed that night anyway, the whole not going out mantra was really a moot point. For a measly $23 we both got HUGE (no joke) chicken burritos and split the steak nachos. I was a big fan of the burrito. Reminded me of the good ol' days in Ann Arbor munching on BTB post football game. The steak nachos were so-so and I don't think I would order them again. They were all chips, cheese, meat ... no veggies, salsa, etc. The next two visits were drunk and dine-in visits and I must say, my delight with Garcia's increased exponentially with the experiences. The second visit, I got the enchiladas verdes and was so happy I got the hiccups. It was also very spicy (nasty side effect of spicy food). In the few months following I went a handful of times and the food was consistently solid drunk food. A great way to wind down your night with a god group of people - definitely a late night spot for you and 14 of your closest friends. The more people, the more rowdy, the more fun! And the margaritas sure help with that. Especially since they come in pitchers.  In future visits, I will probably go drunk and dine in, since they don't deliver and there's no way I'll drive.
