I really, really like this place. Granted, it's not a healthy vegan restaurant...you can walk out with 1000 plus calories if you're not watching yourself. But the food is so tasty and well done. So I'm writing about this place from an indulgent perspective. I had the gyoza appetizer....a vegetable based potsticker....dough was a little thick but overall really good. Had the Titanic BLT burger with mashed potatoes and gravy and it was very full of flavor. I added the cheddar Daiya cheese and it hit the spot. For dessert it was chocolate peanut butter shake....and it was really good. I walked out feeling a bit more full than I liked but I only get there once a year. Service was great and so was the value. Get there early to avoid the crowds and tip well. You won't regret the experience.
