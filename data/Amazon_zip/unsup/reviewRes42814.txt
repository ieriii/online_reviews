This place is delicious. Like: fantastic food *and* fantastic cocktails delicious. I had to get off the wagon to get a second Pimm's something-or-another (with ginger beer, lime, cucumber).  If you are going on a date and you order appetizers, plan on not finishing your entree. Yes: there portions are a little large, rich, and heavy; plan on sharing. No: they don't sacrifice quality for quantity.  Things you must order: the bone marrow appetizer, the rabbit-artichoke pasta, the cornbread side, and the apple tart for dessert. Yum!
