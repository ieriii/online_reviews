600 + reviews, so i wont say much besides "duh, its good". the bbq bacon cheese burger kicked my ass, and won. i was so happy to have gravy on mashed potatoes again. I would have given it 5 stars but the service kind of sucked, and i probably waited 20 mins (after my plates had been taken) for my check. That would have been cool if i was with people, but i was by my self. any way, the food rules, so go.
