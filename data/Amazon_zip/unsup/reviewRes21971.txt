It took me 4 years of living in Chicago to finally make it up to Superdawg, but it was totally worth the wait. Best. Dog. In. Chicago. I love the box your dog comes in, and that it's completely stuffed with some of the crispiest, tastiest fries I've ever had. I love the 1/4 lb. beefy hot dog waiting under all those fries,it really is the best I've had in this town, no joke. I love the pickled tomato. I love that the strawberry shakes have actual whole strawberries in them, not some pink strawberry-flavored mystery goo. I love the retro-futuristic look of the place, and the giant sausages on the roof beckoning you to enjoy the beefy, crispy goodness that awaits inside. I'm definitely coming back to try the rest of the menu, though that may take a few more years.
