The bartender once quoted Emerson to me. How many bartenders in Chicago do you know that will actually engage you in a philosophical conversation, let alone quote a literary great.  I would describe the food as Italian-American fusion, with an emphasis on classic Italian dishes. You really cannot go wrong with whatever you order.  Yet no matter how much I enjoy my dining experiences at Calo, I never feel the urge to GO TO CALO RIGHT NOW. So they get 4 stars, not 5.
