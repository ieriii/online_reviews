Best thin crust pizza I've had in the city. I split a small pizza with a friend and it was more than enough. We went with a "red" pizza and added goat cheese, spinach, and artichokes. Yum.  It's a big place and is pretty casual. It was packed on a random weeknight with a wide variety of people, including a drag queen. We sat at a long table with other people. My friends like beer (I do not) and said there was a great selection. Will definitely be back.
