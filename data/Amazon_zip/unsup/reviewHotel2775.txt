Friend and I crashed here from San Diego for the San Diego State-Notre Dame weekend in early September. I recall a reasonable rate and "W" ish decor. Unfortunately the sober moments in the hotel were far and few between. The front desk staff was friendly and the hangover room service breakfast Saturday morning of coffee, juice, and bagels hit the spot until the Bloody Mary later that morning put me back in the ring for Round 2. I don't recall great views but didn't really care although it was odd watching shoppers go in and out of a drug store across the way while in the shower. Oh and if you get a handicapped accessible bathroom, the floor will appear as if you just got finished washing your car in there. Spent more money in JBar than the hotel but that is another review for another day.
