So I just moved to Chicago and am staying in the logan square area. The main reason for me moving here is the huge foody scene so this is my first of many reviews. Upon arriving asked my friend where we should go and his first though was longman. We get there the thing I noticed was the great atmosphere. We were there pretty late so we just had a few split plates. The first thing we had was the bone marrow with toast, which was absolutely perfect, asked my friend if he thought it was an accident because thats how perfect it was, and he simply says that it has been that way every time. After the marrow we moved on to infamous wild boar sloppy joe which is worth going to this place alone for. The only unsuccessful dish to us was the rarebit which consisted of a pretzel and what was supposed to be in my mind beer fondu, but came out tasting like a beer roux, which is not appetizing at all. Never the less I will be back and am looking forward to it and will strongly recommend Longman & Eagle to everyone I know.
