What a lovely place to eat. The service was amazing. Almost the best I have had anywhere. The food was good. The menu was complete.  They were good. They give you bread and butter pickles and chips as you are deciding on what to eat. They were incredible. We started wtih the Hush Puppies as an appetizer. Good and worth the money. We had a q3 for lunch between 4 of us with an added portion of Kobe brisket. Everything was amazing. It was served with five different sauces. We had a side of macaroni and cheese. It was great. The Cornbread....fabulous. Fries...just OK. Cole slaw was good but not outstanding. The menu is similar at lunch and dinner and the prices are very similar. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone in the area.
