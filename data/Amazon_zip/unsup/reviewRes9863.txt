We had a large group on the outside patio for dinner. Good weather, service, and food. The patio is very nice -- enclosed yet open, not too crowded and not too loud. Since there were 13 of us, we really got to try almost everything in terms of appetizers. My favorites were the burrata, chickpea fries, and griglia mista. For entrees, I had the rabbit, which was a tad overcooked. Several people around me had ordered the special, a truffle pasta, and the smells were making me drool. From the look of it, the truffle pieces were pretty small -- not shavings so much as dots -- but there was a good amount in there. The pizza also looked very good. We also had a couple of desserts to share over coffee -- the mille foglie and something else chocolatey -- they were good, if pretty standard. The only thing I didn't love was that they didn't know who had ordered which dish, so we kept having to direct them to the right people each time they showed up with food. Since we were sitting in the same places all night, it seems like they could have made a note of who ordered what. Other than that, though, everything was great.
