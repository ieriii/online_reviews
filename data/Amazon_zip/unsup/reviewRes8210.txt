I don't get up to this neighborhood often, but perhaps I'll make an effort for this place in the future. Loved it. The restaurant itself is cozy and inviting, and sitting next to the big windows on a sunny day was great. We would have sat outside since it was so gorgeous out, but since it's been snowing all spring, they were just getting around to setting up the outdoor seating area today. (The planters they were planting look like they'll be really pretty when they're all done and set up.) After we ordered, I could not believe how fast the food came out. We didn't order appetizers, but just went right for the pizza, and within maybe 5-7 minutes (?) our pizza was on the table. The pizza is not what what I've been used to having in Chicago. I love pizza in Chicago, and this is something very different... and I loved it. It reminded me of pizza that I've had in Italian restaurants in Europe. (It's a little different than pizza I've had in Italy, but similar to what I've had in Italian restaurants in Germany/France/England.)  I don't speak Italian, so I can't tell you what my pizza was called on the menu. But it was italian sausage, mushrooms, basil, and mozzarella. While I would like to try more things on their menu, I was really happy with my pizza and don't know if I could keep myself from getting the same thing again... though next time I may try one of their Italian beers instead of just having a Diet Coke in the cute little glass bottle. I would also like to try some of their other desserts. I had the pistachio gelato, which I quickly scarfed down (yum).  All in all, it was a fab lunch. The fact that the crust is very thin and the pizzas are individual sized meant that I didn't feel completely stuffed when I left there. I usually leave pizza places feeling uncomfortably full because pizza is a weakness for me and I will eat it until there's nothing left to eat. I was able to walk out of this restaurant with my head held high and my gut in check.
