First time customer and I (we) loved it. There were 4 of us and we each loved the Piece beer that was recommended to us - and loved the 2 different pizzas we tried. The list of toppings is great and although we didn't try anything new or different this time (straight regular pizza sauce) - I like that you can try different pizzas in terms of the sauce type. I would definitely like to go again. Once we're done with the leftovers.
