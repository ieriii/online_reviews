If you want traditional Mexican cuisine and ambiance at a small cost, Nuevo Leon will not disappoint. Free chips and salsa, free appetizer (changes daily), and inexpensive, quality food. I recommend this place to everyone who loves Mexican food. Be prepared to wait. Nuevo Leon has recently become very popular. Cash only. If you want to complain and knock yelp stars because you're not able to swipe your Chase card, please feel free to go elsewhere. Perhaps you may enjoy one of those authentic burrito bowls at Chipotle...
