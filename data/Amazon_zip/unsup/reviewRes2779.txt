Finally spent our $350 gift certificate last night - and let me tell you, spending someone else's money at TRU is the way to go. We like Sauvignon Blanc, and the sommelier recommended a $69 bottle of Sancerre Domaine Vacheron 2007 that was very nice - and seemed to never end! Not all bread is created equal at TRU: Sea Salt Brioche beat Warm Pumpernickel, which beat the Beer Bread We both did the Prix Fixe menu, and here are the results: Prime Beef Tartare bested the Hawaiian Blue Prawns Braised Beef Short Rib was superior to the Nova Scotia Halibut Chocolate Bar and Gianduja Crmeux were a tie In addition to these, there were five other amuse-bouche that were fun surprises - I wonder how they make an exploding mint truffle? We were definitely bringing down the age curve at TRU, and couldn't help but feel like the staff preferred to "chat it up" with the older patrons and make quick work of us. Perhaps it was comments like this that exposed our naivete? Me: "It seems like they made vegetables into some sort of pudding." Sommelier: "It's miso, sir."
