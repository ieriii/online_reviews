Delicious and inexpensive!! I absolutely love this place. I usually get the same things, lamb or chicken shawarma dinner. You get so much for your $! For $7 you get a generous serving of meat with your choice of rice, a side of hummus and your choice of salad and pita bread! I had only had it delivered and just recently went to pick up and saw the salad bar which looks AMAZING! Can't wait to go back for it! My fav middle eastern food in the area by far :) (cash only by the way, even for online ordering)
