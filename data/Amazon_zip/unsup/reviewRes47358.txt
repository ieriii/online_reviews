Arg! I gotta get this out of the way right from the start. There are going to be nonstop comparisons to this place and Kumas. Its like this. If Kumas is your brother thats really bad ass, fun, and into good or obscure bands, then Lockdown is your brother thats out of touch, still thinks Metallica is the best band ever, and has a mullet...but he is STILL your brother so you gotta love him. I think it best that when going here, try to enjoy it for what it is and not compare it to another place because no one can top Kumas (which might actually be impossible). Also, this place is a HARD ROCK bar. It is not metal (yes there is a HUGE difference) and I found the atmosphere to be very, very cheesy. It just seemed really forced. Ok so whilst trying to keep my Kumas radar at zero, I ordered the spicy jalapeno burger. I dont remember the ingredients/ toppings off hand, but it did come on a pretzel bun and to my suprize it was a very good burger. So good in fact, that I would return sometime. The fries were of the standard "fresh cut" variety. The service was really good, but (ive said this before in other reviews) since this place just opened, I know they are going above and beyond to make sure that people are happy and want to come back. They gave us 2 cards for free apps and also they brought us out a free desert. It was sort of an apple fritters with chocolate, cinnamon, and ice cream thing. It was also good, but after attacking that burger, there was no way I was gonna eat this too. Still very awesome that they gave us a free dessert! The Pos: The food at Lockdown is very good, there was no wait and the staff was friendly. The door guy looked like he could have been on Jersey Shore and it was hilarious. The Neg: The place is just so damn cheesy, the decor, the theme, etc, and they just seem to be trying TOO hard.
