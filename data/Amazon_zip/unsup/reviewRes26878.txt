I confess that when I first stepped into this place I wanted to turn my back around and just go home. I didn't really feel "the vibe" of a good restaurant, but Jeremy had read good reviews so I chose to trust him. We sat down and immediately one of the guys came around with two types of salsa, tortillas, pickled jalapeo and carrots, and some sort of meat ball with some potato. I was confused...what was all that food? The salsa was pretty darn good, one hotter than another and luckily Jeremy was the one who chose the "burn my mouth" one. Ha! The waitress couldn't speak very good English, but neither can I. So I give her some credit for being nice, and clean. I ordered the enchiladas, Jeremy ordered the combination plate. I don't know if we were very hungry or what, but that food was good. I wouldn't say the best of the best ....of the best . But definitely good. It made me remember the food I had when we were in Mexico, visiting some village near Cancun. So I believe the food at this place may be very authentic. Price is cheap. We paid 20 bucks for both of us. That scares me a little. I don't like the silverware, the plastic cups... They were not the cleanest. But they were ok. Well, I think we will be back soon. We are in love with Mexican food, and this is one of the best places we have been so far.
