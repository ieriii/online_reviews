-Don't bother to go there searching for Cuban food. -Go there to eat their Spinach Benedict. It's a little pricy but it's worth it. -Outdoor area is nice and breezy for the summer, wonder how cute it is in the evening. -After reading a review that raved about it, I went to go try this amazing dish last Saturday for brunch. I was NOT disappointed by any means. Cute guy behind the bar when you first walk in, too! ;)
