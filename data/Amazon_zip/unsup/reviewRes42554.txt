What do I want on my pizza? Ham, Mushrooms and Onion obviously. Fogo has 20 pre made options which is cool, most of them containing artichoke hearts and none of them my go to, HMO. Well maybe they do but the language they use in their menu is so authentic that its kind of hard t figure out what was on each pie. (Hint: mussarela = mozzarella). After I narrowed the 5 pizzas in my cart down to two (love you online ordering!) I ended up with the Bbq Chicken and the Fogo 2 Go, the BBQ chicken being the clear winner. Fogo 2 go: Brie cheese is one of my favorites, surprisingly it does not go with pizza. IT tasted sour or bitter, maybe just strong than what I'm used to, but I eat a lot of brie so that is questionable. The crust was garlic delicious and everything was fresh I think I just picked the wrong one on this try. Bbq Chicken: The true winner with a heavy load of fresh chopped cilantro, thick ribbons of sweet bbq sauce and rich creamy smoked gouda. The chicken was a little odd tasting but I didn't die, yet, so I will let that pass. The pizza is classified as thin crust though the slices are THICK thanks to generous heaps of topping. Thick is good in pizza, not as good in regards to one's thighs. On my second trip I got the Bbq chicken calzone, though I do love their crust the calzone made me feel like I was eating the Pillsbury Dough Boy. I will be sticking with the pizza's. As the name states this joint is for carry out and delivery only though luckily it was easy to order and delivered promptly (though I do live like 5 blocks away, don't judge!) I will definitely be hitting them up again when I get an original pizza craving.
