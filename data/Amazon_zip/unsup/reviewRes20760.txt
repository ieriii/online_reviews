Yummy. Huge fan. I've only ordered take out from here - the line is simply too long and the wait seems too lengthy for not the greatest seating inside. I am incredibly pleased with the two items I have tried - the XOCO salad and the Woodland Mushroom sandwich. Both so tasty in their own ways - full of zest and uniqueness. I love the salsas and guacamole. I look forward to trying their hot chocolate. I wish there wasn't always such a long line...but that's a sign of a great place.
