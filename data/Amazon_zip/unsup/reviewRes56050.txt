I got to give it to the gut who runs this joint, he must be a marketing genius or he just got lucky. I see nothing in this place justifying the popularity and hype and as for Chicago landmark, please! Don't bring more shame to this city as tourists stopping by for the famous dawg are sure never to return here again. Short version is: fries are s...t, dogs are average, rest is questionable at best. BIG fan of FD&C Green No. 3 and Blue No. 2 (?), than you will love the relish. Do you die for crappy fries dip fried past the point of recognition by taste (?) than Superdawg is your place. Like a good dog? Do yourself a favor, go to Jewel and get some Oscar Mayer dogs, some buns and than you see the difference. Sorry for the bad review, can't help being honest.SD.
