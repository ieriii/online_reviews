NEEDS WORK!!! Over crowded (can't move), not honoring reservations (mine was 40 minutes late), food was an Asian version of Rockit's menu (glorified bar food). The kitchen could not even get our dinners correct (we ordered 4 entrees and they all arrived at our table 5-10 minutes after the last)... Seriously over-hyped!!!! I wish you luck if you choose to go to Sunda. Japonais anyone???
