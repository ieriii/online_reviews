This is a hidden gem in Chicago where you have the opportunity to be transported back 80 years the minute you walk through the door. The feel and the decor makes your imagination race. You start thinking about all the stories of Al Capone sneaking out of this place during prohibition. Then you suddenly realize there is a jazz band playing in the back of bar and that just brings everything together. It's a shame the drink prices aren't like they were back then! ;)
