I came here with gift certificates so beware of bias. I also paid the same amount for 1/2 the amount of food the day before at Joe's, so I'm feeling good about RJ Grunts. The veggie burger was nice and crispy on the outside, the cottage fries were yum, and the fries were yum AND the cheese sauce is awesome! My husband's burger was a bit under done, and he wished it wasn't half the the size of the bun - but dug the meaty burger selection. I want to try a shake, the mac n cheese, the salad bar, the portabella burger - so I'll be back.
