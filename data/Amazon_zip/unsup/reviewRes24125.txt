The service here was very friendly. The atmosphere was nice and the crepes are delicious. You can make your own or order one off the menu. I always get the mint tea. Very minty and delicious! Its a bit far north to travel to, so if you want something closer to the city check out the sister restaurant called Crepe and Coffee Palace. I do however think the crepes taste better at Icosium Kafe.
