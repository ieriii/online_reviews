The one star is for their reservations. Made a 7PM last night for 6 people. Showed up at 6:45 and they said someone was at our table and we would need to wait until 7PM. No problem. Checked again at 7:20... no movement. Finally, at 7:30 I checked again... They said nothing they could do. So at 7:45 we left. They're becoming a victim of their success. Weekends are a nightmare to get into this place. Went here a few months ago on a Sat nt around 6. Got the last table and when we left at 7 HUGE crowd waiting.
