What a waste of a restaurant. Owners should probably eat in their own restaurant and figure out why the servers are so inept and the kitchen is so clueless. On back of menu, owners tout how their pizza is constantly evolving from their mother's recipe from 40 years ago, and how they visit the competition. Meanwhile, their waiter doesn't know what al dente means, the chefs can't make a proper eggplant parmesan- best they can do is melt cheese on undercooked, greasy thin eggplant look-alike slice, and the management isn't paying attention and doesn't care even when alerted. Also, the wine list is fit for a Rite Aid. Can't even recommend people I don't like here.
