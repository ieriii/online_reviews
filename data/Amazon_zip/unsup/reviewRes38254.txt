The small pizza for two was plenty! My friend and I got the "surpeme" pizza with the meat and veggie combo, I don't remember what it's called -- we were flying from Rome and we were both uber tired -- Pizza in Rome is awesome, btw). It was delicious!!! I don't think I could compare it to Pizz'a Chicago or Patxi's. Their pizzas are good too, but I think being in the city of the Chicago deep dish really does it for the flavor too? The interior was very pizzeria-ish, red/white plaid table spread, wooden chairs and deep green leather sofas. It's a great family place and a date place. The outside make Giordano's seem like it was the place to be. It as very very busy when we got there. Luckily they had the "order first then wait for your seat" because we ordered 35 minutes before we got seated and our pizza came out maybe 10 minutes afterwards :) Excellent timing guys -- A on efficiency ;) If I go back to Chicago O'Hare airport for a lay over longer than 4 hours, I'll be here ;D Go deep dish! (Also, the service was EXCELLENT. I don't remember who our server was, but she was super nice and thoughtful :) )
