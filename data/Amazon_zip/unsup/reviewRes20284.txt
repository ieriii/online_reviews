Hands down best lunch I've had in recent memory. It truly is worth the wait; it's easier with a glass of their fresh lemonade (the hibiscus was quite tasty as well). Plus they have self-serve sparkling water on tap which was a perfect addition to a half-glass of the lemonade. I had the woodland mushroom torta and loved every bite - actually could have had at least one more. The bread is perfect - crunchy and light and the mushrooms incredibly flavorful, tangy and mellow at the same time. The fresh made ice cream with pasilla pepper brownie chucks and fresh local berries were amazing and the best dessert to finish off the savory delights!
