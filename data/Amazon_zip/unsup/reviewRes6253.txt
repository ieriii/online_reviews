I went here last night with a few friends that should be (cross your fingers) moving back to town. I knew they loved Mia Francesca's when they were Chicago residents, so when I saw the same group behind that restaurant had a new place in Little Italy, I thought it would be a great place to try. Although there is no easy public transportation to Little Italy, we got a cab from the loop for about $12. I had previously called to ask about the alcohol policy, so I asked for Patrick at the door. FYI the alcohol policy is no outside liquor but the restaurant does what it calls "retail pricing.". Apparently that means that the bottles are supposed to be priced similarly to a Binny's then you add a $7 corkage fee. There is a wall of wine bottles, reflected on a long menu. There are also wines by the glass. The food is small plates/sharing style. Some of our favorites were their take on caprese salad, the ravioli, pasta with sea urchin and crab, the potato pork belly pizza, a red sauce pasta with sausage. The risotto and beet salad were good, but not as outstanding as the others. We ordered a bottle of one of the cheapest wines and no dessert. We were stuffed!  With two predinner drinks, wine, and all that food, our bill came out to $65 for two. The restaurant is not currently taking reservations so it's worth calling ahead to check the wait. Since they were featured in the redeye and having upcoming features, the wait is sure to increase!
