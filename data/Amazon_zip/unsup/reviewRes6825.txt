Chicago Q blew me away. My sister and her boyfriend visited Chicago for the first time and a friend of hers recommended it to us. God bless, it was some of the best BBQ I've had anywhere. The ambiance and service were as good as it gets. I want to go back and hang out in the upstairs area with the leather couches and big screen. I'm also seriously interested in returning for brunch. Splendid evening!!!
