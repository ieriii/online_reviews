It's said pizza is like sex. After a couple drinks, even if it's bad it's still sex/pizza. Piece earns major points in my book and has quickly become one of my favorite bars in Chicago. I say "bars"... not pizza. We went on a Saturday night for live band karaoke, which potential crooners beware, unlike your usual karaoke, there's no bouncing ball on the screen showing you the lyrics in time. You gotta know the song. This is great because it scares away some (but not all) of the people who suck and gives the people who know what they're doing a chance to shine. They'll give you a sheet with the lyrics on it, but if you're gonna go, bring some charisma because you've got a whole stage and band to work with. Sign up early because the set list gets really long. (For the record, I did Johnny B Goode by Chuck Berry and KILLED IT.) Like many other Wicker Park establishments, it features $2 PBR cans which helps keep the costs of a night in the city under control. They also brew their own beers. The Disfunction Ale was actually quite good. Sort of reminded me of Leinenkugel's discontinued Apple Spice, but with a fuller taste. The pizza is kind of a disappointment. I hungrily devoured three slices, but the composition isn't that great. It falls apart easily and makes everything messy. I can think of at least six places in Chicago that have better pizza. It gets crowded on Saturday but thins out a bit after midnight, remaining lively, so get there early. Four stars for the cheap beer, delicious beer, and awesome live band karaoke. Piece should get five stars, but their crappy pizza ruins it.
