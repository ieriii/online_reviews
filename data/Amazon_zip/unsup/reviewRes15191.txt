This is one of the most interesting and coolest bars I have ever been to. The rules intimidated me at first but they really are'n't so bad. This is a place to savor hand crafted cocktails and have good conversation, not get stupid drunk like at a frat party. My boyfriend and I came in on a Saturday night around 8pm and there was only one party ahead of us so the wait was only a few minutes. We were seated at the bar where Owen took care of us the rest of the night. He was friendly and very knowledgeable about the cocktails and never made us feel dumb for asking questions. I love the overall ambiance of this place. I felt as though I were in another world. The bar is sectioned off with velvet ropes giving each section an intimate feel. The bar area reminds me of an old pharmacy with all of the cool old bottles and cabinets. They played a mix of 70s rock and indie music and the volume wasn't too loud at all. They did start playing r&b/rap later on which kind of killed the mood though. I don't remember the drinks we had and they aren't on the website menu, but everything we had was excellent. I like how everything is the same price, too. This is a great place for a date or to go with a group of friends who can appreciate a good cocktail! Don't bring your drunken fool friends here!
