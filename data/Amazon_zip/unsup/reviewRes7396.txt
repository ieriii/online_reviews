Had dinner here with some friends last night and it was awesome! Service was friendly, food was fantastic, and the space is cool too. Huge portions and it's pretty reasonably priced. We tried the pulled chicken, kobe chopped brisket, pulled pork, and St. Louis and Baby Back style ribs. I'm getting the meat sweats just thinking about it - and that's a good thing. My favorite may have been the St. Louis ribs, but the pulled pork comes in a close second. SOO tender and juicy. Everything comes with their 4 sauces - the spicy BBQ was really nice and had a great kick but you should obviously try them all. The mac n cheese was also outrageously good and the braised greens were really really good too. Corn bread was meh. You could come here for literally anything - dinner with friends, a date, your wedding. This place is a crowd pleaser!
