It wasn't bad and our server was nice but a little slow although the bus people were very efficient. We were told that the plates are small plates so we ordered two extra dishes to compensate. However the when dishes arrived we realized that there was too much food. The plates were small for Italian dishes but they were the perfect size entree...not too much or too little. I thought they were regular sized entrees for anywhere else in the world except in America. They wine choices and chocolate mousse was excellent.
