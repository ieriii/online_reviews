What can I say about The Hopleaf Bar? Everytime I have been here, I have a great experience. I've been coming here for nearly 10 years, and each time is like the first time. The atmosphere is great, though it can get loud on the busy weekend nights. However, that just adds to the mystique and allure of the place. The beer selection is second-to-none. They have the largest selection of Belgian beers that I have seen anywhere. Looking to drink a Miller Light or Bud? This is NOT the place for that! Some of the best beers I have ever had were first sampled at The Hopleaf. Megan, the head bartender, is fantastic. She is really nice, hospitable, and thoughtful. Slim is fantastic as well. On my last visit there, I took a very special lady with me. It was her first time there and Megan new it immediately. She made sure to take care of her and I and made it a memorable experience for us overall. Did I mention the food? Oh my gosh....they have the best steamed mussels I have had anywhere in Chicago. Also, the fries are FANTASTIC with the garlic aioli. But the showstopper is the Montreal style Brisket Sandwich. INCREDIBLE! Every time I go there, I eat that sandwich. If I am feeling down, I eat that sandwich. It's that great. I would recommend this place to anyone who has an affinity for great beer, great food and a great atmosphere. Beware though, it can get quite busy on the weekend nights. Get there by 7:30PM to get a table or a spot at the bar! Sitting at the bar is ideal though...so you can get taken care of by Megan or Slim!
