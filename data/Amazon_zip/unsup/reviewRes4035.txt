The...most....amazing culinary experience I've ever had. I went here on a whim after a girlfriend called and said she got a random reservation there. I think the best way to go is to call and say you'll take a reservation whenever you can. That's what she did. We did the 3 course meal which ended up being more like 6 courses or so for $55. We brought 2 bottles of wine (BYOB=LOVE) and after we'd paid (4 hours after we arrived) the chef started bringing out all kinds of other wines for us to try. The food was absolutely incredible, every bite we savored. I can not wait to go back for the 9 courses. The chef and his crew were so much fun, after we got them drinking wine! :)
