Excellent food, excellent service, and excellent presentation. I took my boyfriend here for his birthday and our experience was great! Our waitress suggested we get a little bit of everything off the menu instead of sticking to two entrees and it was an excellent choice. We had a few appetizers (stuffed avocado), some sushi, and some great bao. I highly recommend any asian food/sushi lovers to check this place out. The inside has great decor and the way they present their food is so creative and pretty! We will return to sunda!
