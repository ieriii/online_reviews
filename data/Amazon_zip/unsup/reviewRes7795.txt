Handmade lobster raviolo and coupons?!?! Fantastic and cute little restaurant in the middle of Lincoln Park making the most amazing Italian food I've had in Chicago. The service has always been amazing and the deals/coupons that come in the mail with being on the mailing list help. Salads and appetizers are fresh, wine lists are extensive with a wide range of prices, and the entrees are to die for. The sauce for the lobster raviolo is spot on and nothing I've tried has come close. Desserts are great, but most of the time I stick to salad and entree. The dining room in the back has more space than the front room. The atmosphere is always decorated beautifully and in season. I'll keep going back!.
