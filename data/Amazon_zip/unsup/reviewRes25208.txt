Cute place. We came here when there was a big line at meli's. The chicken lemon soup and Mediterranean salad were just ok. The soup lacked salt and the salad was really oily on the bottom. My kefta sandwich was good but it didn't arrive hot and the bread was too big for the amount of meat inside. The service was the worst part. The appetizer and the table bread were served with the meal. Then the dishes came out staggered and not all at once so it was awkward. I would come back for desserts maybe but not another regular meal as there are so many great ones in greektown!
