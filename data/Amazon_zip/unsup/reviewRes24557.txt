I would say 3.5 stars. This is me and my husband's late-night place, for sure. We love everything about this place, it feels very open yet cool inside, love the split level and street-side tables, with their decoration you really feel like you are in a cafe in Greece (well, as for other greek restaurants in greektown as well). Anyways, we usually get their Artopitas and a couple of their specialty drinks, rarely we have dinner here, just cuz it feels too casual for that. Anyways, loved their artopitas, my favorite would be the Mushroom and Emmenthal, yum! Besides small plates, we also really love their baked goods, they have a nice variety of baked goods but my absolute favorite has to be the pear tart, I haven't found another place that has better pear tarts than this place, it has just the right amount of sweetness, you can totally taste the pear and the crust is baked to perfection! Yes I admit it's a bit pricey here, but you're in the heart of greek town, it's expected.
