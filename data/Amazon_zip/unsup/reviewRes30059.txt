The girl introduced me to this place early this summer and I'll admit I was rather skeptical about an all veg menu. Sitting in their cozy outdoor patio, sipping freshly squeezed lemonade (which I highly recommend btw), skimming their significantly unique veg menu I concluded that the "Half Pipe" sandwich would be a sufficient compliment to my charming summer evening... ...and I say sufficient because I was expecting a severely mediocre meal. This mountain of bread, lettuce, country fried seitan, topped with onion rings emerges from the kitchen and instantly gives me a chubby. By now my mouth is watering and I have a slight tingly feeling all over my body. The waiter sets the dish, nay, the shrine down in front of me making primal instincts surface and involuntarily cause me to shove the contents of the plate passionately (remember...chubby) into my mouth. Hot damn the Chicago Diner knows how to make one hell of a sandwich! If you're ever in the neighborhood, or just looking for a bad ass veg spot i suggest stopping by for a bite and a milk(vegan)shake.
