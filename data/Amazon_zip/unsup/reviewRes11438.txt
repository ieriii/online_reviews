Do you like pizza? Do you like beer? Do you like eating delicious New Haven style pizza and drinking fantastic brewed-on-premises craft beer? If you don't, you may have a problem. Piece serves up fantastic thin crust, coal fired New Haven style pizza. The sauce is tangy and flavorful, the crust crispy but not too crispy, and the topping choices almost unlimited. Ever had potato and clam pizza? No, it's not an urban legend. No, it's not an elaborate practical joke. Piece has it all, and it's all done right. Now, keep this in perspective, Chicago is a city of great craft beers and incredible pizza, yet I keep going back to Piece. Piece's brews, in sum, are surpassed in my heart only by those of Great Lakes Brewing near my home growing up. Piece does what they do (pizza and beer), better than anyone else in Chicago.
