I had a great experience at The Gage. I happened to be with my family after a work night, and the manager came by and moved us to a quiter place away from the loud after work crowd. Of course, this should be standard policy, but I've very rarely had management notice details like that. I honestly think our sever was tweaking out on something because he couldn't seem to focus on anything, but I'm going to ignore that because the management was so good. The owner came by afterwards and asked us for our opinion (which is a very good idea for a new place). I was surprised how smoothly things were going for such a new place. It can only get better, but it was already at a very high level for a new place I had to give them 5 stars. Food was a classy version on standard and not so standard Irish bar food. I found they put a little flare on each dish to make it stand out from the norm. It's pricey but it's nice to have some good food inside (ok, just outside) the loop. There are so few nice places around there for after work that you can go to in a suit. I hope they become a mainstay in Chicago for a long long time.
