Uh...pretty freakin' tasty BBQ! Full disclosure, my office went for lunch before this place officially opened, for a 'friends and neighbors tasting', which basically meant we got to eat anything off the menu for free...and we got a tour of the restaurant and kitchen...and Lee Ann Whippen (of Throwdown with Bobby Flay and TLC's Pitmasters fame) was actually there.That bias aside, the food was awesome. About as authenitc BBQ as you can get for being an upscale restaurant in the Gold Coast. The guy who works the smoker told me they use 4 different kinds of wood (hickory, cherry, maple, and maple...I think) to smoke the meat. The baby back ribs were super flavorful, and the pulled pork is so juicy and tender. They have 3 different sauces (two tomato-based, one vinegar) which are great. Onion rings were great, tried a piece of chicken and it was juicy and great. Everything is great...well the hush puppies were a little bland, and I didn't care for the pound cake club dessert (bananas had a weird texture and the bacon in it was a little over the top).The place isn't cheap, but more reasonable than you would expect. BBQ 'flight' appetizer is like $8.50 - totally reasonable. Half slab of ribs about $16. You can go nuts and pig out with some entrees for like $30-40 or bring a crowd and get the whole pork shoulder for...$305!!!Bottom line: an absolute must for any BBQ enthusiast, and just a regular must for everyone else.
