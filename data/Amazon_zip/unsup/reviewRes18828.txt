We were in Chicago for July 4th weekend and I had found some good reviews, so we decided to try this place out. I had originally picked it because it's a pub and I thought in my head that it would be a fun, casual noisy and cozy/friendly place for a meal. Well, I was a little off. The Gage is trendy and kind of upscale in ambiance. The mood they set in the restaurant is relatively formal. I was surprised to see that it was a relatively family friendly restaurant, since it's a pub. The dining area is separated from the bar area, so it has its onw space and atmosphere. The food was pretty delicious and beautifully presented. They had an amuse bouche with the appetizers we ordered (I love when they do that). We were there for lunch. Glad because it's a little pricey for what it is, but the lunch menu is less so. The only other downside -- while we all enjoyed our meals, only one of the four of us said we would order the same thing again. That could be partially due to the fact that they have an incredibly fun menu and you want to try everything because it sounds so good. However, it also means that while our dishes were really good, they weren't amazing or addictive. Overall, had a great time and would go back.
