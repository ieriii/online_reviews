This is the crispiest, tastiest, most amazing wing I've ever eaten. One problem - no beer! The Seoul Sassy & Buffalo are tops. This rivals my long-time favorite FatHead's in Pitt. If they put in a full bar, this is my last meal. BTW - the fries are just as outrageously good! Get it all and take Lipitor later - it's worth it!
