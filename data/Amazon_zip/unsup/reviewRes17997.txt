Never have I had so much trouble picking a burger. They all sound incredible--what creative taste combinations. My buddy and I split the sliders, so I got to try the wagyu burger (my life is changed), the On the Lamb, and something else. They were all great--flavorful, creative, well balanced, and satisfying. The beer selection is equally overwhelming, but in all the right ways. Service was great. love this place.
