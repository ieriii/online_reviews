So my boyfriend and I decided to check this place out after I'd read some reviews. I won't lie, the main calling card this place has is free valet parking. No they don't have a garage, but they will find a place to put your card which leaves you not having to do it. We went on a Wednesday night which is their lobster special but seeing as how we weren't sure how much the evening was going to run us, we went on the cheaper but not cheap side. I got pasta and he got salmon both of which were good, and I'd say above average in taste. The waitress was forgetful but see did it in such a way that I didn't seem to care that it took her six trips to the table for her to remember to bring me hot tea. The room was on the crowded side with tables but not with people due to the day of the week I would guess. The experience might have been much different on a Friday night but everything was calm and quiet except for the occasional guitar and violin performance and of course flaming desserts. My boyfriend did get a little too close to the fire when the table behind him ordered one of the flaming balls of sweets but overall he came out unharmed. The second biggest draw to this place which will likely take us back is that they give you A LOT of food for a very reasonable price. We ordered an appetizer, got two kinds of bread (one of which I think wasn't for us to be honest) two soups, two salads (although I had peaches which were amazing instead of salad) two entrees (salmon and manicotti), dessert, a cup of coffee and a cup of tea. All of this was around 54 dollars without tip. There are few places in Chicago or nearby areas that you can get that amount of food for such a little price. SO bang for buck, this place has it. If you can handle the fire, random instrumental sessions and possibly crowded room, this is the place to be.
