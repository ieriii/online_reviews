This is probably my favorite pizza place I have ever been to. Now granted, I'm not a Chicagoan and I never grew up on deep dish pizza in my hometown; but to me, this is the best place to get pizza in Chicago (or anywhere else for that matter). The meaty legend is my favorite and each time I am in town, its as good as I remembered it to be. I have only eaten at Giordano's and Lou Malnati's, other than Gino's, and for this Seattle boy, Gino's wins hands down. Each time I've been here, there's always a long wait, but knowing what's in store for me keeps me standing out there until I am seated.
