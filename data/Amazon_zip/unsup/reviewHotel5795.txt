Was here for a one night stay. It's a warmed over two-star. The help is very friendly, and the bed was comfy. If that's all you need, it's a four star. The bathroom was midget sized, the flapper ball in the toilet needed changing, and honestly, the room is just too small. Go away from here if you're a plus-sized person although it's just at the edge of tolerance for average sized people. The WiFi was very slow and oversubscribed. It failed several times. The restaurant was covered in another review. It's not bad. There is no breakfast plan here, although they will serve up breakfast for group bookings. The rooms don't have much sound insulation, and we could tell you verbatim the phone conversations in the room next door. We didn't try the TV, although it looked good. Could have been worse, I suppose.
