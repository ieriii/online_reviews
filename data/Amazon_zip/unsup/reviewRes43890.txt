I really like coming here for a weekday breakfast, but it is to be avoided on the weekends. It's hard to walk in without tripping over all the strollers strewn about. I'm not sure why this place attracts so many parents (and I don't judge you, breeders, the problem is the enormity of your strollers). The breakfast menu is great (french toast and huevos rancheros are standouts), and soups are usually good, but I've never had one of their lunch selections that I would order again.
