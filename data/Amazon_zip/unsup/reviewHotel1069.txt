The rooms were spacious, the tv was big, but that was all this place had to offer. There are no pools. The free wifi was questionable, and when taking a shower anyone that flushes the toilet throughout the hotel will affect your shower water. It's so odd that it's connected. I would prefer the Swiss next door. They are also currently remodeling the front.
