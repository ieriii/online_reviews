Good lord, I could probably spend a lot of money here. Great little shop thats (thankfully) not too close to public transportation, which makes it difficult to do any damage there -- but if you can afford to do serious grocery shopping there you probably can also afford to cab it home with your things, or valet park your Jaguar there. It's the staple items where the prices are jacked up- your standard butter, milk, and eggs are really the items where you see the huge markups. All of their prepared items are great and priced actually pretty fairly. They have a great selection of meats, cheeses, and wines. So yea-- more of a special occasion store than your average Sunday afternoon stock-up-for-the-week market, at least when you're an entry level sales assistant.
