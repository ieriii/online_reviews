This is my go-to place for drinks and appetizers (or a quick meal) when I find myself on North Michigan. The ambiance and menu cannot be beat. It has the energy of the city, with the food to match, without sacrificing a comfortable feel as well. I could sit here for hours trying new wines and spreads. I think tourists and Chicago people mix here nicely, AND I have never had to wait long. The only downside is the service, but obviously it wasn't bad enough to affect my rating. Don't go here if you want particularly respectful or attentive service, though.
