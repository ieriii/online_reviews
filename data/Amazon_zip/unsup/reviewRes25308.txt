Went here on a saturday night for a date with my wife. Although the food was traditional, and the wine list was longer than we could have imagined, something just didn't click here. It was probably the most romantic place i've been in the city, a dark, dimly lit, cozy cave. My wife didn't like the amount of nutmeg in the cheese fondue, it was a bit overpowering. The chocolate fondue was excellent. The service was top notch, and the waiters have deadly accuracy with a water pitcher, they can hit your glass from across the room without spilling a drop. That being said, i guess the only thing we didnt like was the amount of nutmeg in the cheese fondue, and also the fact that it was a bit too cramped, oh there was one other..... yeah...I was ear raped. The fucking whores in the booth next to us that couldnt keep their voices under 90db about cheating on their boyfriends, and how their sexual needs hadn't been fulfilled and a whole bunch of other bullshit that was forcefully shoved into my ear without my consent. At one point my wife used the restroom, so i decided to count how many times they uttered the word "like" throughout their conversation....208 in 6 minutes.......... Hey Geja's, can you ban these bitches like you banned the kids??? KThanksBye!
