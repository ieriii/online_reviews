We stopped here after a long bike ride. I had sticker shock when I paid the bill...$20 for two hot dogs and two small shakes. Way too much money. Hot dogs were OK, but could you spare a few fries. I think they spend too much on all their fancy packaging so they have to charge those outrageous prices.  Fat Tommy's on the South-side does a good hot dog, delicious fries and has a great beer selection. And, you'll go home with change.
