My friends and I chose The Purple Pig as the first restaurant to eat at during our first night in Chicago. We got there around 11PM, asked for a table for 6, and was told the wait would be around 45 minutes. We agreed since we really wanted to try out this place, the waiting area was a nice place to hang out (you can order drinks while waiting), and we really didn't know any other good alternatives that was opened at that hour lol... We finally got sat at a table outside. Since there was 6 of us, we had to share the long table with some other patrons (they were all very friendly btw, made the dining experience better). 4 of my friends weren't hungry so they all ordered desserts... I think they ordered the majority of the dessert menu hahaha. From the reactions I saw, everyone enjoyed the sweets. For me and one other friend, we were starving so we got some real food: Purple Pig Platter, Roasted Bone Marrow with Herbs, Milk Braised Pork Shoulder with Mashed Potatoes, Pork Sweetbreads with Fennel & Apricots, Prosciutto Crusted Cobia with Venus Clams & Sea Beans. The waitress told us even though the portions were meant to be shared, it was still a lot for 2 people but I said it was fine since my friends can eat the rest if we can't finish. The Purple Pig Platter was the first to be brought out and it was amazing! I didn't even know there was this many different type of meat that can come from a pig HAHAHA. I don't think this restaurant let any part of the animal goes to waste lol... The other dishes were brought out as soon as the kitchen was done making them. My other favorite was definitely the Milk Braised Pork Shoulder with Mashed Potatoes... mmm... so soft and tender.... For my dessert the waitress recommended the Sicilian Iris, she said it was the most popular choice by customers. No wonder... it was very tasty. The service at The Purple Pig was very good. Our waitress checked up on us many times and was very friendly when we had questions about the menu.
