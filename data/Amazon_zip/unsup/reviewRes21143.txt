Someone told me that his friend made a list of all the mexican restaurants in Chicago, and went to all of them and ranked Mayan Palace as #1. Hence the visit. I've had a lot of mexican food in the city, I like Perez in Pilsen a lot too but this place is really good. It could be the memories of the margaritas... I'm not sure. The food is pretty solid, I had the huachinango (red snapper) veracruzana and had the mango margarita. The guacamole and salsa was very very solid as well. The servers and staff were all super friendly and nice. Like, extra nice. I'm reading the reviews here now and it seems consistent with our experience. I would come back again.
