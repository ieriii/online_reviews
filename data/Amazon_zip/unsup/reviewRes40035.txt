AMAZING!!! I had the Pork Belly Porchetta, Corn-Bacon Risotto, Summer Squash, Chanterelle Mushrooms, Black Garlic Emulsion dinner last night and I can''t stop talking about it. The service was excellent the dessert is stuff that dreams are made of and the risotto is still making my mouth water. For dessert i shared the creme brulee it was so good I wished i had ordered it by myself. The drink menu is very impressive. Can I just live upstairs and eat for free? Mark my words I will go back to try lunch, and brunch which I hear is fantastic.
