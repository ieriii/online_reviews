If you like waiting in line and don't mind spending $15 on lunch on a decent, not spectacular meal, then XOCO is for you! First of all, I can't get an explanation out of anyone how to pronounce the place. No one, not even my hardcore foodie friends know how it's pronounced. I ordered a chicken tostada and a side salad. The tostada was good, but the chicken was dark meat and the bread seemed like a french roll to me-way too doughy. The side salad was lettuce, jicama and cucumber I think. All things that have no flavor and surely do not command a $4 premium. Long line: 30-40 minute wait to be seated during your lunch break at work. Decent food. Pricey. That's all you really need to know.
