So far, this is the best that I can find in Chicago. It's absolutely packed every time I'm there, and the rice dishes have been pretty good also. My parents and I were watching them roll the egg rolls one day and noticed they use the same egg roll wrap that my parents use. And my parents' egg rolls are amazing! Their spring rolls are much better than usual restaurant spring rolls. Their egg rolls were superb also. I had awesome Com Tam too. The only part of this restaurant that I have to be a tough critic about is their pho. I'm from Denver, the pho capital of the nation; and don't mess with us on that title, we take a great amount of pride over our pho, and if you think California has good pho... we laugh. Pho at Pho Xe Tang though, came out incredibly hot, burnt my tongue, so I give it to them for that-- that helps make a great pho. And I do like that in the meatballs there's ground up tendon. The tai was a little cooked for my liking, and their "Xe Tang/Tank" sized large should be called a medium in Denver. Well, okay, it's a little bigger than a medium, but it's smaller than Denver's large and that's for sure. The broth isn't as amazing either, but definitely worthy of eating out here in Chicago. The herbs that came out doesn't come out as plentiful and generous as Denver either, probably half the amount-- which is actually just enough for us to eat, but I would prefer they act more generously on that.  The service was a little wack for my liking also. I mean, they were packed and all, but they could at least TRY to smile at you. And they randomly had an extra drink on our order that wasn't ordered.  So, I must say, great pho for what I've seen in Chi-town, thus far, but Denver holds the crown.
