Okay being Korean American, I am the first one to say, unfortunately Korean resturaunts aren't known for great service. In fact the service is really bad. Now I believe this review should be about the food and experience so I must -2 stars due to the poor customer service. The food is good, not the best Korean but, for a late night craving it's great. Expect to leave full and satisfied. Not blown away :/
