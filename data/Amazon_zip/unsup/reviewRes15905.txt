Our party of four arrived Friday promptly at 8:00 PM for our reservation which was made a week in advance. We however were not sat at our table till 9:00. This ended up being fine as we were able to enjoy a drink at the large crowded bar and watch the rest of the basketball game on one of the many televisions in the bar area. I found it to be quite smoky at the bar...welcome to Chicago.  After being seated it took our waiter 15 minutes to bring our first drink. I happened to order a martini with blue cheese stuffed olives - I specifically asked for 3, I was brought 1. This was corrected in about five minutes, and it was well worth it as they were very good. The food was very good, everything seemed fresh and homemade - I truly enjoyed the gorgonzola gnocchi with goat cheese as it was very rich and tasty. I would go back for the food, however the service was less than satisfying.
