Now, I'm no crepe connoisseur and by no means do I have Greek in me (well, minus the delicious Greek crepe swimming through my stomach). These crepes are by far the best I've had so far in the city. The crepe itself is light and fluffy with just enough flavor to hold its own. The fillings are as fresh as the new friendship I made with Icosium. I always go with the Icosium Crepe (substituting the red peppers for fresh avocado) and O.M.G, the flavors explode into my mouth like a carefully planned fireworks show set to the best 90s radio station around! Literally, this is the best place I've had for crepes. Yes, the place is tiny and it's usually always busy, but the crepes, coffees, and desserts are what I call             FANTABULOUS!!
