I'm a huge fan of Irazu, huge. I've been going pretty regularly since 1995, when it was a tiny place with 2 cramped tables.  As the place has grown the quality of the food and service has stayed at the same high level. I enjoy it so much that I bring all of my out of town friends to Irazu for dinner.  None of us has ever left disappointed, just full. I love the Costan Rican sandwich, it's a simple sliced beef sandwich served with lettuce, tomatoe and completed with yummy Lizano sauce. I always pair it with the fried yucca and garlic. So good! The chorizo and eggs with rice and beans and fried plantains makes a wonderful meal. I always finish off my meals with a shake, they have a number of fruits to try and you can have them made with either milk or water. I suggest the guanabana with milk. Again, so good. Another thing that I love about Irazu is the BYOB policy. In the summer it's great to grab an outdoor table, enjoy a burrito (or anything off their menu) and crack open one of your favorite beers or wines. Plus, no corkage fee.  The prices are really reasonable too, so Irazu is great for cheap eats.  I think that the Check Please effect is still in effect, meaning that sometimes there is a wait. Also, parking can be tough. But it's always worth the trip.
