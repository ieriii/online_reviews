Well let me first say I have had the food from here before and I enjoyed it. I thought what a great place to bring my family (since my mother was born in Cuba) for a good authentic meal. So on a saturday afternoon at 1pm we pulled up. It was a glorious Chicago afternoon and a perfect day to sit outside. But they wouldn't seat 5 people in the patio area. Yep, thats right with only about 8 tables occupied and plenty of room for us to fit at a table meant for 4, the host wouldn't seat us outside. My sister asked twice if she was sure she couldn't seat us and the hostess' response was Sorry we get busy Well it was 1pm... they weren't that busy and we were 5 paying customers!!! I will never be going back, how could she not accomodate paying customers! Lets just say my mother wasn't pleased either and she will be sharing this with her friends as well.
