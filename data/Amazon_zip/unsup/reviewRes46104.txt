I treated my wife this past Sunday, as she has always wanted to try this restaurant. We were seated in no time, even though there were many people waiting to be seated. The menu is quite varied. I had chicken and my wife had a Thai shrimp dish. We were impressed with the presentation, and when we took our first bites we were sold. A bit pricey but I thought it was worth it.
