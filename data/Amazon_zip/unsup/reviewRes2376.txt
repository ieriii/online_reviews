I went there on a Friday afternoon, and I waited for about an hour and a half! The waiting was terrible and it didn't help that it was a little chilly. I went with my boyfriend and we both got two hot dogs each and duck fries. Try their specialty dogs! Its the best! I wish they had a little more room since everyone always eats there instead of taking it home or picking it up. Do not take a large group, cause itll be hard to find seats. Overall, I have to say this is the best hot dog experience I had in Chicago. THIS PLACE IS CASH ONLY! :)
