I was skeptical about Sprout - I'm a huge Top Chef fan, but I don't believe TV fame necessarily means real talent. Glad to say, I was proven 100% wrong. The food was creative, beautifully presented, and most importantly absolutely delicious. Not a single dish disappointed. Highlights were the octopus and fois gras apetizers, and the short rib main course was sick (in a good way). Another pleasant surprise: the service was impeccable, our server was enthusiastic, knowledgeable, super friendly and his recommendations were spot on. Quite unexpected for a restaurant that hasn't been open that long. Would definitely recommend and will be going back very soon! $60 for 3 course plus couple of freeby small courses. Wine extra.
