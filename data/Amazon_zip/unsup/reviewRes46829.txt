Stopped by this place after work with a friend last Friday. We sat at their outdoor seating area on a parking lot. Although, the view wasn't that great, the food was. I had the salmon and a glass of pinot noir. My friend had a very plain looking vegetarian sandwich with a glass of white wine. Service was great, waiter was very knowledgable and informative. A bit pricey but overall very satisfying experience.
