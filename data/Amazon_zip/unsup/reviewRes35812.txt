The best Chinese BBQ I have had outside of china. The people who give this place a bad review 1. Probably really don't know about food 2. Review a place after one time instead of trying more then once 3. Have no taste buds. I work in the industry and really want to go to your job and review your performace after watching you for 10 minutes. This place is great. Never had a bad time, it might not be prefect but the food is always great. As I said haven't had better Chinese BBQ in this country and have traveled to all major citys.
