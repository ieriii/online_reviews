We tried Mercat during Restaurant Week this year-- it was one of the worst Restaurant Week experiences we've ever had. The server immediately tried to steer us away from the RW menu and pushed their higher-priced tasting menu on us. We had to specifically ask to see the RW menu and he begrudgingly brought one, claiming that the portions were significantly smaller and that we would need to supplement other courses from the regular menu or we would leave hungry. We went ahead with the RW menu anyways (it's why we came, after all) and added a few side dishes. The couple next to us was persuaded to order completely a la carte, and chose several of the same dishes that were included on the RW menu. When the food came out, the portions were identical! Waiters brought out the same food for both tables and there was absolutely no difference. With the extra courses that we ordered at the insistence of our waiter, we ended up with way too much food. We felt totally ripped off in the end. Combined with the inflated drink prices, it was way more than we intended to spend and we couldn't even finish our food. I don't understand why Mercat participates in Restaurant Week if they aren't willing to embrace the basic principle of it. Additionally, the service suffered throughout dinner service. Empty drinks and water glasses littered our table for most of the meal. Getting fresh plates was like pulling teeth. And the bill showed up before we were done eating (a huge pet peeve of mine). Honestly, most of the food was wonderful. But with the service we received, we will never be back. Avoid this place.
