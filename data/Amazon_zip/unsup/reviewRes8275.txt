I am not sure what the seduction of mozarella slices and some basil leaves is, but throwing that on some pizza crust is all Spacca Napoli has to offer. Oh, but maybe it's the canned mushrooms that warrants the $15 price tag on an individual pizza. Lacking in all creativity and distiniction, this place is simply bad food and high prices.
