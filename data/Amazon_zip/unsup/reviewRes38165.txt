My boyfriend and I used to love this place for the mussels, but after our last visit, we will not be back there to eat again. It was a Thursday night and the dining room was busy, but not full. We were seated right away (crammed in since the tables are too close together there), and given menus and water. We perused the menu, but nobody approached us again for 15 minutes, even though there were plenty of servers around. I finally got up and approached the hostess, who went upstairs to find our server. After a few more minutes, a waiter finally came over and greeted us. We told him that we were very hungry and thirsty, and that we'd been waiting for 15 minutes for someone to come over, and his response was, "Oh, that is absolutely not true." Whatever happened to the customer is always right? After he implied that we made the whole thing up, we got up and left, and went to La Fonda where we had a great meal with outstanding service. It's too bad, because we used to be big fans of Hopfleaf. We may go back for a beer, but not for dinner. We never did get the name of the rude waiter, but he had a long beard.
