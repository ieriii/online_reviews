I must admit that I'm not a pizza fan, but this is way better than a classic one. The small size is not for 1-2 people, it is for 4! Considering the ingredients (so much cheese) I would say it's a cheap place. On the other hand, the crowd kills me! The only thing I hated about this place is that they tell you to wait for an hour, they don't give you buzzer and they want you to stay there all the time: preorder in 20 minutes and be ready! Not worth spending that much time again.
