carnivale is a place that i normally would be hesitant to go to because of the size... i've always been a fan of more personal restaurants where you can gain more of a personal connection with the food... however, carnivale makes up for its large interior with the overall experience and fun factor... walking past large carnival curtains, you enter a big room with a giant bar and host stand, waiting to serve you drinks while you wait for your table... full of vibrant colors, funky oversized decor, and stimulating art... you are bound to not get impatient while waiting for your table (especially if you have one of their great drinks in hand)... once your table is called you yet again pass large curtains and move into an almost warehouse like building... the same vibrant colors, stimulating art, and oversized decor follows through to the dining area... the music, the vibe, and the trendy wait staff make you feel almost as you're set right in rio de janeiro... or just a real trendy circus located in new york city... either way, it's great! the food is great, not amazing... but not bad by any means... it's a bit expensive, but the experience is well worth it... the guacamole is good and strongly recommended, as well as the ceviches... what really makes carnivale a great experience is its brazilian drinks... with one of the best mojitos i have ever tasted, i had to try to the rasberry one... the rasberry mojito quickly took the prize as best mojito in chicago... the prickly pear margarita was also a showstopper and had a good balance... with a good balance of vibe, great wait staff, good food, and stimulating decor... carnivale does it well... i will definitely head back even though it's a bit more than other restaurants serving the same quality of food... this place gives you a whole experience, and personally... that's what dining out is all about...
