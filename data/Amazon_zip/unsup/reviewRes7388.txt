Went here on a Saturday night - the place was packed. Everyone seemed to be thoroughly enjoying their meals. Bright white interior reminds me of my ole kentucky home. Seriously tho..this place offers excellent food. Hand made chips, and the sweet pickles...to die for and unique. Started with Bacon Cheddar Hush Puppies, spicey but couldn't stop eating them. Main dish - I had Kobe brisket and my gf had Baby Back Ribs...and 3 different types of bbq sauce to compliment the meat which was delicious on its own.  We also had a side of Mac N Cheese-Yum. Finished off with the huge chunk of espresso brittle ice cream..omg was it awesome..people were stopping by our table asking what it was. Drinks were good as well....and the service was friendly and attentive. Overall bill for 2 people was about $100. But it was soo worth it.
