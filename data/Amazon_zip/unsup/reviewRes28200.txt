This place is awesome. My boyfriend and I don't live near this restaurant and make a special trip from Oak Lawn whenever we are in the mood for great Mexican food. The prices are pretty reasonable and the service is pretty good. We love the free sample appetizer they bring you before you even order your food. I highly recommend their salsa preparada...it's pretty spicey but highly addicting! This place is excellent, but anticipate a little bit of a wait on a Sunday afternoon. It gets pretty packed sometimes with a line extending out the door.
