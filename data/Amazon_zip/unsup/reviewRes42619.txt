Fogo, you're getting 2 stars to start. I'll reevaluate after the next time... I picked up a few take-out orders of chicken last week with some other items: mashed potatoes, potato salad, corn, rice/beans, garlic knots and one of their choxinas (spelling?). The prices were right/good, but I had mixed reactions to the food. The chicken was cut up in pieces and nothing seemed really meaty, I don't know if it was just the ones I got. The meat was good, juicy, they could have/should have included a sauce with the chix though (we ordered a whole, and a 1/4). Potato salad was good, corn was good/plain, rice/beans okay, mashed potatoes were pretty garlicy - a prep to the uber-garlicy/oily garlic knots. These things were literally heavy dripping with oil. I took a bite of one and it was like it was completely saturated with garlic oil, it felt like it filled my mouth with it - way way too greasy. Makes my poor stomach hurt just thinking about it. The choxina was interesting. Shaped like a gigantic egg, this was a breaded mashed potato ball with shredded chicken in the middle. Interesting, not something I'd have to have again though.  All in all, I felt like everything was too greasy/oily and nothing that spectacular. I would like to try their pizza sometime though, that looked good. The chicken, probably not....
