Just going to add a line to say that dinner at Longman, particularly late-night dinner, is some of the best food available in the neighborhood and tends to have a lot better service. Still, I wish they would focus on hiring consistently good staff (and possibly get a floor manager) instead of whomever "looks right" for the place- there have got to be customer-service oriented hipsters out there somewhere, right? Lula seems not to have a problem with this.
