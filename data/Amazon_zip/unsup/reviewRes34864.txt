Good news, it's easily my favorite Asian-Fusion spot. The 5-0 roll and Godzilla are the best. BYOB awesomeness. Good music, and Japanamation on the projection screen is interesting. Bad news is I haven't tried much else as far as Asian-Fusion aaaand they've become quite pricey. What happened to 1/2-off rolls on Mondays? All-in-all, well worth the splurge ever now and again.
