Not only is this restaurant lovely and comfortable inside, but the service and food were both excellent. A friend and went for breakfast on a recent weekend morning, and we both enjoyed it. Plus, the price was reasonable! We had the Nanadict and the Tofu dish and both were great. As for portion sizes, they were more than ample for us. A pet peeve of mine is a huge, overpriced portion that I can never finish. Nana's portions were just fine. Although I live on the north side, it is more than worth the trip to enjoy the homey but elegant surroundings, and the very good food.
