Fogo is absolutely amazing and the staff is very friendly. I absolutely love their homemade bread bowl salads where they make the bread bowl fresh in the brick oven! The pizza slices are huge and delicious. My favorite thing is the Coxina balls. This place is highly recommended and promises not to dissapoint :)
