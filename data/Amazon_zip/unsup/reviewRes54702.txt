Decided that I wanted seafood for my bday, and was told to check out Joe's Stone Crabs (Mind you my BF and I were visiing Chicago) So we called Joes and they could not seat us till 9:30 but they told us that they'll be closing at 10pm, so that was a pretty huge hint not to make the reservation with thm..... So then we called SHAW's (at 7PM) asking for a 8:30PM reservation. They didn't have 8:30 but could put me in at 9PM which was not too bad. Hostest also asked if it was a special occasion, but didn't want to tell them it was a birthday.arrived at 8:45, the host was very poliet and had a table ready for us upon our arrival! we got the booth seating and the Host pulled the table out so that I could be seated in the booth. Once we sat down they started pouring us water and offered us bread. our waiter was already there waiting to greet us. Told us the specials of the day and a few recomendations for first time visitors. Very very professional and polite.This is what we ordered:2 Bloody, 1 stellaChef oyster sampler plater 1/2 DozSpicy tuna maki2 lbs Steamed lobstera Whole Dungenous Crabkey lime pie and a cup of coffee.Total with out tips $ 165.00 which was not bad... we thought it was pretty cheap compared to the prices in CANADA. However do have one complaint about the sushi, the rice was a bit wet/soggy, The Key lime Pie was to DIE FOR!!!! haa haa, it was not too sweet and very tart, how it should really be! Becuase being 1st timers the pie was FREE! which was very very nice of them.SO TOURIST/VISITERS if you want a night of absolutely fabulous SERVICE and FOOD.... Shaw's the place to be!
