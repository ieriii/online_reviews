Overall, this was a very disappointing experience. Although they have an impressive wine list, the food was incredibly mediocre--bland and uninspired. The music was unnecessarily loud (bad 80's tunes), and the ambiance was generic. It's hard to believe this was the best the former chef of Avenues could come up with. I will not go back...
