Yes, it's an Intercontinental, but not quite as nice as other Intercontinentals I've stayed in. In fact, there were a couple major flaws: (1) The rooms are NOT soundproof. At all. Like I could hear the conversation in the next room. I could hear people walking around in the hall and doors slamming. Not great. (2) The curtains are not lightproof. Both curtains were drawn and I still awoke from all the light coming into the room at 6am (we were facing east so...). (3) Crappy towels and no bathrobes. (4) Comfy bed, but kind of scratchy sheets. (5) Fancy looking bath products but I didn't really like them. HOWEVER...the location really can't be beat. Right on Michigan Avenue. About two blocks from the river. A ~10 minute walk to most train lines. Also to note: Breakfast at the hotel is $23 for a buffet. Not unexpected, but breakfast isn't usually a meal I like to splurge on. You can order a la carte, but be aware that juice and coffee (which are included with the buffet) are ~$4 EACH. Breakfast entrees are in the $8-13 range so maybe you DO just want to get the buffet...  I did really like the wine/cheese/chocolate bar located off the lobby. It was pricey, but very enjoyable.  We hotwire-d the room and I think total (with taxes and everything) it was about $125/night (and actually the next to cheapest hotel we found in the Loop area). This is a place I would stay again if the price was right, but other than that, I didn't find anything fantastic about it.
