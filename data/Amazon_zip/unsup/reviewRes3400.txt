I've been here twice. Both times, the so called "Buddah Bowl" (aka Bibimbap to most people) was pretty yummy. Good and plentiful ingredients, and they veggies taste pretty fresh. The bulgoki (beef) is marinated pretty well. I suggest it! As far as the chicken goes, if you want authentic korean fried chicken, this is not the place. HOWEVER, if you want something that RESEMBLES authentic korean fried chicken, come one come all! I like the seoul sassy (i think it's called) chicken wings, but not the other ones.... forgot the name, but basically it's a fried chicken wing covered in Goju-jjang (hot sauce made of bean paste).  The first time I came here, the chicken wings tasted old and lost some of their crisp (ha...crisp), but the second time they were SUPER crispy and delicious, and seemed to be just made!  Anyway, if craving korean in the lincoln park/lakeview area, this place is a pretty good bet. Seating is limited, and don't wear a white shirt... (unless you want to sport speckeled-white after memorial day)
