I went on opening night, so keep that in mind while reading this review. Their service was attentive, but slow. My husband and I arrived late to meet my family (it took 2 hours to get to the city from the NW burbs -- blasphemy!) and the nice host put us in an elevator and then ran up some stairs to meet us at the top. Hmmmm, we could have taken the stairs too, but OK. We were seated with my family and immediately asked what we wanted to drink. The servers were also helpful with food and wine suggestions/questions. The family was starving and had already decided what they wanted to order. We glanced at the menu quickly and made our decision as well. Soups and salads came out fairly quickly and were OK. I got the spinach salad, which I found to be pretty bland (but huge!!). Our entrees came out 45 minutes to an hour later. Some people ordered steak while others ordered fish and we all seemed to be pretty pleased with our selections. Some of the sides were OK, while others were underwhelming, though. They just lacked flavor.  There was one amazing thing I ate at Mastro's. Wait, two things. 1. Their homemade butter cake. OMG, this was absolutely amazing! 2. Their homemade whipped cream. I won't lie: I took spoonfuls of this and ate it alone (don't judge). One last thing: noise! This place was loud one minute and too quiet the next. They had a live singer who was singing the most random mix of songs from pop to 90s grunge. It confused me. Overall Mastro's was good, but it just didn't live up to all its hype I guess...
