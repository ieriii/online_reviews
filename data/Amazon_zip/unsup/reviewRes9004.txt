pros: atmosphere, dark and lit by candles, intimate, perfect for to take a date (please don't take your loud kids.. it sorta kills the adult-moment), i sat upstairs and the theme is 1920's safari. i was totally into it! cons: the food. we take a look at the large menu and all we see is meat. not vegetarian-friendly... even though they make it seem like they are, because once we told her we didn't eat meat, she brings over a tiny menu. like, one of those flat little ones a corporate restaurant has on the side of the table showing the new lunch menu specials. there was 1 option for appetizer, the spring rolls, and 3 or 4 options for entree's. we chose the spring rolls (which was quite good... it was small, crunchy, and they brought over some lettuce, carrots, and other veggies with some sauce we could make into a lettuce wrap) and for dinner, we got the veggie curry... the veggie curry gave me the rumbles in my tumble... i couldn't more than a few bites, it was lacking flavor, texture, and seriously made my stomach feel like there was a hole created in it. my boyfriend finished the rest, and i was left with a stomach ache! a bad one!!! i would recommend this restaurant if you eat meat. i went here once more when i used to eat meat and remembered my experience was much better.
