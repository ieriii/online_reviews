Can't fathom that we've come to the point in the 'evolution' of society where peeps think Bonsoiree is a high-quality fine-dining experience. The chef/proprietor is pretentious, both in his table-side manner and in his menu. Flavors that are simple pleasures were ruined with at least one ingredient too many. It's like he's trying to prove he's more clever and talented than he actually is. Dude, you want to know how real chefs hit it out of the park? Go two blocks down the street to the unassuming Chilapan where a master works and they're genuinely nice people who care more about the $40 we spent than B.S. does about a single course. On the other hand, if you assume slow service with a bored, pretentious flair, lifeless decor, and $200 out yer pocket should be part of your faux fine-dining experience, then Bonsuckee is for you... and I'm being kind.
