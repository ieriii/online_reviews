When asking around about Chicago Pizza, the two names that came up were Gino's and Lou's. It wasn't till I talked to some local pizza lovers that I came across this place. They told me that they hoped that my opinion of Chicago pizza wouldn't be reflected by my experience with Gino's. Well....this was my last meal in Chicago and I have to say that this was one of the most memorable of them all.  We came right when it opened and we took advantage of their lunch special, which included a 7" one topping pan pizza and beer or coke for $5.  Five. Dollars. I had my pizza with Sausage, Garlic, and Fresh Tomatoes. Paid only $1 for the extra toppings. The garlic added some nice flavor to the sauce and it was the best dollar I spent in Chicago. The sauce was great, the pizza had a great crust with a nice crisp, and the ingredients were very flavorful. It was a great piece of pie and the best we had in Chicago. If anyone has tried a better pizza in Chicago, then I would love to hear about it. But this was clearly the best in our trip to the midwest.  So definitely try Gino's and Lou''s to get your own opinion, but don't be foolish by leaving this out of the discussion if you're looking to try the best pizza of Chicago.
