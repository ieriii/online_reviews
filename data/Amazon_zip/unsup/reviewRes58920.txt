While the food was really fun, more eccentric, yummy...our service left something to be desired. We asked for help sorting through the menu, and got a blank stare and smile. The gentleman that cleared our plates was more interactive. Would go back for the food, and hope for better service. You want to be able to ask your server for recommendations, especially with a menu you are unfamiliar with and willing to try new and different.
