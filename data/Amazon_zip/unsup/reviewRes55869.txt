Being my first visit here I did not have high expectation for this place and was pleasantly surprised with the closeness to authenticity of the food. I ordered chicken vandaloo turned out to be highly spicy but amazingly satisfying; the service was also good not great. My friends ordered some veggie entre were also satisfied and happy through not completely they complained about some entre being too bland. Over all I am satisfied and would go there again.
