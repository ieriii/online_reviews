Went here with some lady friends for dinner and stuffed ourselves silly. We shared the crab cakes, which were nice and crabby... big chunks=perfecto. I had the scallops, which were verrrry good. Nice and big and perfectly cooked. I will say the bottling price for byob wine was a little steep, but it still beats paying too much for a glass on its own. I can't wait to go back and try something else. mmm.
