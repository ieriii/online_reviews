This is the end of the world when it comes to pizza in America. There is no #2. The owner has duplicated in painful detail the pizza found across the pond in Napoli. As for the bufala mozzarella pizza: in its simplicity we found perfection. And to those that are not familiar with this style of pizza: yes, the crust is supposed to be charred on the bottom. We cannot get there often, but it is worth the effort and we have never been disappointed.
