First of all it's a torta not a pannini!! I'm visiting from Los Angeles, where you can find tortas almost at every corner and I have to say COXO made a great attempt. They are gourmet style of course...and thats why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. I had to pay three times what they cost back home. Its an interpretation of a classic recipe but not authentic.  :)
