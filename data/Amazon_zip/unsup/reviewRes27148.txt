Can I please bathe in the goodness that is Graham Elliot? Ohmygoodness. I'd heard about it, I'd thought about going, but I always went elsewhere. Big mistake. If you haven't been - get there now. He's changed up the menu a bit since some of the past reviews, but delicious nontheless. I had the Kung Pao Chicken to start - seriously melt-in-your-mouth amazing. The peanut brittle gave me goosebumps. A fantastic interpretation of a standard dish. I then ordered the sauted Alaskan halibut for my Sea portion. It was prepared lovely - had a smokey flavor to it and was hands down, the best fish I've ever had. My party did wines by the glass & asked our server to pair whatever he wanted - I was glad for that, as our wine went perfectly with the meal. The ambiance is so chic and fun - it's true what they say - accessible upscale dining. The soundtrack ranges from Seger to Radiohead. And for that, I am in love. I'm still giddy thinking about my food coma from that night.
