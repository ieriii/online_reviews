We was chillin at tha holidae innn.... Hell no. I guess if you wanted to smoke or whatever it would be a badass hotel to stay at. When I came here for my buddy's wedding, I booked a room through priceline. They stuck me with a smoking room. Totally disgusting. The front desk lady said, "on the bright side, we're giving you a really good room with a view." The view was nice, but it was disgusting because the the smoke smell was suffocating. It smelled like a bar, and I think my clothes came out smelling like smoke too. I would rate the place higher if it wasn't for that. I think they gave plenty of us nonsmokers in line smoking rooms. I'm not sure if it was bc we used priceline or what. Usually most upscale hotels are nonsmoking anyway. Anyway, thank goodness it was only for one night.
