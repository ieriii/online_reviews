If you are looking for a good breakfast place.. you have found it!! This place is amazing and very inviting. The tables are close together but it's a breakfast place so I don't mind. They always have specials that you can choose from and if you want more options there are plenty on the main menu. I usually come here during the week for breakfast since it does get really busy on the weekends. I try to avoid the long wait but if you can't it is still worth it. I have ordered the mana mou skillet, mixed berry french toast and the caramel banana pancakes. All have been amazing. The mana mou is a must order!! I usually order hot tea when I go but the freddo coffee is great too. Especially if you have a big day ahead of you!! It sure will get you going. I have heard about the creme brulee french toast that they sometimes have on the weekends and think that will be what I have next time!
