Yummy beer, inventive food, and kick-ass decor. Nothing like giant fists to welcome you to Revolution Brewing - I like it! I've been here a couple of times, most recently on Labor Day in desperate need for food. Hurrah! Their kitchen was open, unlike the neighboring Lula Cafe and Longman & Eagle restaurants I've been meaning to try. 'Twas no disappointment, however, after all the walking around. This gave me the chance to try those Steamed Mussels I've heard such good things about. I ordered the hard cider, blue cheese, leek, fuji apple style mussels as my meal, and I was amazed. Our server recommended an extra order of the toast as it only comes with 2 small pieces. Small? Not really, but I definitely devoured all but one of the extra slices to dip into all the juicy goodness at the bottom of my bowl. Perfection! A fantastic dish as an appetizer or to devour all by yourself! We also ordered the Sweet Potato Cakes to start - loved them as well. The curry spice and extra yogurt topping was just right. For dessert we shared the Eugene Chocolate Cake and Ice Cream which was a housemade porter ice cream. This tasted very coffee-like and the cake seemed almost flourless. Delicious! Needless to say, a satisfying meal and plenty of choices to serve everyone. I am a fan!
