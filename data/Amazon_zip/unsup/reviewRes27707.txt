Their pan pizza is fantastic. Things I like about it: Focaccia-like Carmelized crust, burnt mozzarella on the ends, meatball sized sausage, large ingredients, and enough cheese and sauce to make is a chicago-styled pan pizza. The sausage may have changed a little bit when Burt sold the place. It's got a little more spice. It's seems more like an italian sausage than a more mild sausage that is signature at Burt's and other deep-dish main-stays in chicago. The restaurant has a good beer-selection-- not the best in Lincoln Park, but they have plenty of Micro-brews. The Clybourne location also has a second level so you're not going to wait long on the weekend. The main floor has plenty of TVs and has a nice renovated interior. I also like that they put a sheet of tin foil over the pizza when you get carry out. It really seems to trap in the heat. I love watching the steam come out of the box when I open it.
