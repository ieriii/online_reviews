Always had a great meal at Uncommon Ground. You feel good knowing that the food is sourced from organic and local farmers or even their rooftop farm! Service is great. Their servers know what they are talking about and has always been prompt and polite which is unfortunately not the case at most restaurants. The Friday farmers' market in the parking lot during the summer is filled with friendly and knowledgeable vendors.
