I saw something a couple weeks ago that sums up the awesomeness of Hot Doug's. A guy came out of Hot Doug's and just threw up everywhere. Of course, that doesn't sound good, but the reason why he threw up (as his friend explained to the people watching him vomit) was because he WANTED TO CLEAR UP SPACE SO HE COULD GO BACK AN EAT MORE! Sure enough, after throwing up the guy went and got back into line, ready to eat more dogs. Hot Doug's is so good, it's the one place where it's totally cool to be bulimic.
