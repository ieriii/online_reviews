Where to eat on a Friday night at 10pm? Bringing out my handy dandy Yelp app we found Sano's and they have Italian beef pizza, who can say no to Italian beef? My cousin and I were at the point of fainting due to hunger and as soon as we heard Italian beef say no more. We venture over to this little spot on the corner of Elston and Lawrence. At first we were going to do pizza slices since we were so hungry, but they only had cheese and pepperoni available so we opted for a medium Italian beef pizza with a side of giardiniera and an order of fries. The fries were freshly fried and it was scorching hot we ate every bite and as the pizza knew we were waiting it came out as soon as our waitress removed our empty fries basket and place the ol' so scrumptious pizza in front of us. Thin crust with a good portion of cheese, sauce, and Italian beef. Perfection never looked better. With an ice cold Arizona ice tea and Italian beef pizza we couldn't ask for a better combo. Our waitress was very tentatively and extremely friendly. Great service and food! Only $20 for fries, 2 drinks, and a medium pizza!
