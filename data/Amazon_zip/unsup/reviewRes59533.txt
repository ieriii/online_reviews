Unfortunately I didn't get as good of a experience as I had hoped. After reading the many reviews which were pretty good I was excited. Drove all the way to Chicago and was disappointed.The service was ok. I wasn't expecting for much but she barely came to check on us. The food was ok. There are a lot of side dishes! I liked most of them. We wanted to order tripe but the waitress told us that IT WASN'T GOOD. We were kinda shocked but since she gave us her opinion we decided not to try it. We got the brisket, bulgogi, and marinated ribs. I like the marinated ribs and my sister liked the bulgogi.I don't think I'll be going back. I wasn't full or satisfied. Hopefully, others will have a better experience than me.
