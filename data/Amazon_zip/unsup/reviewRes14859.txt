The food, service, and alcohol are all fantastic. My family and I recently went here for father's day. I have been to Sabatino's before, and similar to my other visits, the food, service and price were all excellent. I split the rack of lamb with my father and it was delicious. It was cooked to perfection and was also a filling portion.
