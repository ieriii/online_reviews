Decent Chinese. 5 stars for spiciness. I'll prob go back but there are better places in Chinatown. Ordered the potstickers, boiled beef in spicy Szechuan sauce, chef's special dry chilli chicken, & the ma po tofu. They were all good choices but the boiled beef stood out as best to me. The almost broth-like sauce comes blanketed in chili pepper flakes (see my pic), great over sticky white rice, the cabbage gives it a nice crunch, the beef is soft & tender, but the spicy flavor punch hits you hard in just the right spot. Our chicken was ok. It had potential but it came out kind of dry like it was over fried. Yes, it's breaded & fried chicken pieces. We were not expecting that but it was eaten up despite it's arid texture. Potstickers are a classic. Great doughy outside. Always my Chinese comfort food. The tofu was the runner up. Great flavors. I forgot to mention they serve a spicy cabbage & onion "slaw" app that comes with your food. I dig it. Unfortunately it took quite some time to get our food. We went tonight on a Friday at 7:30. It was def busy but I know they could have done way better service wise. At least the server was nice & they didn't mind splitting our check 4 ways on credit cards. My take: the spot is a Chinatown staple. If you haven't been you should try it especially if you love spicy. Not recommended for those afraid of spice. They would be in some kind of hell I'm sure. If traveling w/ "those people" I would bypass this place & head to Joy Yee--- where the white people go.
