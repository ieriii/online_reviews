We went on a Tuesday night and it was pretty packed. It was really nice outside so that must have been why. Anyways, no parking, but its wicker park. Valet is 10. We got in and ordered this delicious appetizer, it was cheese spinach and tomato with chips, and it was really tasty. We ordered New Haven style pizza. Here was the problem, we wanted to order something different so we figured instead of mozzarella it will be replaced with Parmesan which is what it said in the menu. The pizza was tomato sauce and a couple sprinkles of Parmesan, not enough for a pizza to taste like a pizza. We ordered spinach on the pizza so it just tasted like a salad. No pizza flavor at all. We ordered the 2 people 6 inch chocolate cake for desert, but the cake was cold and kinda tough to eat. The service was average. Not a repeat place, maybe with a big crowd.
