Wow! this place is one of my most favorite places for a meal that is prepared slightly out of the ordinary way! blueberry pancakes with a cream topping, the beef with eggs and just about anything else is prepared so perfectly I have yet to be disappointed with anything my son or I have gotten. if you can find parking and get there just after 2:00 you won't have to wait in a long line to get in because I think they close at 3 or 4. Just get there and you'll understand exactly what i mean by everything is so good.
