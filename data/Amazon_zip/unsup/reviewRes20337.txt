Oh god. This place was SO GOOD. I am a pretty serious fan of Mexican food and I love caldo de pollo and pozole, so this was a match made in heaven. I am often leery of hot, happening places (because I hate being overrun by hipsters and middle management in their saturday night finery and because I hate to wait in lines), but this place is worth it. So, here's the deal. This is Rick Bayless' less-expensive cousin to Frontera Grill. It features quality mexican street food and is a bit less formal than his other establishments. I have eaten Mexican food across the country (including a LOT during my four year tenure in California, where I ate at La Super-Rica, Julia Childs' favorite taco stand), so I feel like I can can talk about it. A'ight, you go in, you wait in line (which is usually long, but moves at a good clip) and you order your whole meal. Then they cook it to order and bring it out to you.  ...and then you DIE from deliciousness. Go here. It is affordable, it is delicious and it will make you so happy you will waft out on a cloud of yummy and loudly proclaim the genius of Rick Bayless for blocks, like everyone in the neighborhood never heard it before.
