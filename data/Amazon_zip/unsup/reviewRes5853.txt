Wildfire is a great place to get some amazing All-American food. The chicken, salad, beef tips, etc. You cannot go wrong at Wildfire. On top of the great food, they do have a nice little beer selection. It's nothing too crazy, but nonetheless, it's not Bud-Light! A little tip: Wildfire's Wheat beer is actually Goose Island's 312.
