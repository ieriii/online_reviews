We visited Sun Wah for the first time with couple of friends last month, and were really impressed with the three-course Peking duck meal. This is a real feast - roast duck and side dishes, duck fried rice and duck soup. The roast duck was beautifully rich and crispy skinned, and the soup and fried rice were both delicious. The staff were fast and efficient despite it being a fairly busy night, and kept the green tea coming throughout the meal. We also tried a couple of appetizers, including the tofu and mushrooms, and egg rolls, which were OK but not great. However, they also have BYOB, which is great if you want to bring along a favorite beer to wash down the duck :) The menu had plenty of other interesting options and we are keen to visit again soon to see what else is good, though it is worth going for the duck alone!
