Yo, the pizza's fucking dope here. The options they have are pretty wide and varied, from the type of crust, to the toppings that you get, and it's really good. I'm personally into thin crust, and this is some pretty good stuff here. Unlike some of the other pizza joints I enjoy, this one has a bar, which has a lot of appeal for those friends of mine who like to drink, and from what I'm told it's very good, so take that for what it's worth. I actually really appreciate the atmosphere, and thought the music was a good level where I could keep a conversation with my friends, and the TVs weren't distracting. I also was really big on the decor, namely the art. It has a cool aesthetic, and it fits the vibe. I really like it, and I'd definitely go back. I actually can't wait to introduce some friends to this place. So, I'll close on this tip: The portions given in the menu are totally off. The servings are actually pretty large, larger than one would think given the estimate. I mean, it's not the end of the world having leftover pizza, just be prepared to throw down with your friends over who gets to take it home.
