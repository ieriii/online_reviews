I went there this evening for dinner and it was perfect! The food was seasoned perfect and it was worth the $$$. I love that it is BYOB. Our waitress was so kind, warm, and professional you could tell she truly cared if we were having a good time. I just moved here with my wife a few months ago, and this is the best place we have tried. She even was so kind to recommend some of her favorite places to eat.We ordered the 7 course and received items like lobster, veal cheeks, and spare ribs smoked in a box. I saw that the table next to us didn't eat meat, so they received things like sable-fish for a sub. It was only $85 a person, and you bring your own wine so its a great deal. The decor is very comfortable, like you are eating dinner at someones home. The tables are not too close to each other, and although the dining room was full it wasn't too noisy which is important to me because my wife and I don't get much time together. I will be back! It was super hard to get reservations, but the room is so small, the food perfect, and the service top notch it is no wonder why!
