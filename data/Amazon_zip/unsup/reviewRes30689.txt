Listen. Shut the hell up and pay attention because someone in this kitchen has lost their mind. Duck confit gravy over gourmet biscuits? In Bridgeport? Now THAT's what I'm talking about! There are few huge, cipollini onions and dark greens that sit along with generous shreds of duck meat. Since you're able to pick 2 eggs any style, I opted for sunny side up, which was perfect as the sinful yolk dribbled down the side of the round onions onto the bed of square biscuits suffocated in this sublime gravy with just a faint kiss of caramel. The ingredients in this dish were just made for one another.. the only thing i'd consider is a less ballsy-tasting flour, to take a back seat to the gravy. So before getting there, I knew I was in trouble when I whipped out my Yelp iPhone app to check the menu before arriving and didn't have to read the rest once I saw this dish listed. The only fear I had was that a menu change might have erased it. After shopping at my favorite Unique Thift not too far from the White Sox, I decided to snatch a tasty almond florentine from Impallaria Bakery before eventually finding some local lunch. Though it's one of the best pastries I've had, I should have put that on hold. A couple of years ago we checked out Nana, when they were half the size and was mainly a breakfast spot, in a similar vein as M. Henry in Andersonville. We're fans of M. Henry but since I now live just a few blocks away from Nana, there's no way I'd hike to the tip of Chicago and wait in line behind 987 people for M. Henry again.
