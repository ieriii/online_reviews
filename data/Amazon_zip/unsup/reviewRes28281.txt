I really wanted to like this pizza, especially after all the glowing reviews. And for the most part I did, but I had one problem with my pizza. I ordered a pepperoni pizza, and the pie was covered with so many pepperoni that I thought I had ordered a "pepperoni lovers". Why complain? Well, I tend to enjoy my pepperoni cooked into the cheese as oppose to the pepperoni thrown on top merely as another topping. And because there was so much pepperoni the pizza had a very salty taste. So why am I giving this 4 stars? Because when I took off the pepperoni this was one heck of a pizza! Next time I order from Pequod's, I'm getting the cheese or sausage pizza. (I should also mention that Pequod's has a great relaxed atmosphere with a good staff.)
