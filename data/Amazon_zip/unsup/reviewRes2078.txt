Still amazing. I've recently tried some amazing specialty hot dogs that everyone should try. The merlot and blueberry infused venison with raspberry cheese on top, the rib eye with crispy onions on top, and the buffalo sausage with serendipity cheese are some of my favorites there. The duck fat fries of course are a must if you go on fridays and saturdays.
