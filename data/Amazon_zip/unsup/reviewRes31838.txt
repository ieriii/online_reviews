I'm not a vegetarian of any sort, but this was good food. Whatever it was made out of - I don't really care. It taste guuuud. My vegetarian friend recommended I try the Country Fried 'Steak'. I would never order something like that on a normal basis i.e. something covered in gravy, but if I was going to only once a year it would be here. They could sell the gravy in bottles and I'd happily buy it. The mashed potatoes were excellent as were the pesto covered veggies. I also liked the vibe of the place. Some places I have been to were more concerned with reminding me they were vegan/veggie than they were with being a restaurant. The Chicago Diner is a really good restaurant that happens to be vegetarian, not a vegetarian restaurant that is popular because it is vegetarian. Final note - wish we had saved room for dessert... I'll be back.
