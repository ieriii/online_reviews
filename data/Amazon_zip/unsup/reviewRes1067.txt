Hot Doug's was everything I thought and wanted it to be. The dry humor from Doug, the interesting selection of hot dogs, and the humorously themed sausage decor.  Foie Gras dog was good but for $9 its one of those, I have to try it at least once in my life. I rather enjoyed the ribeye sausage with the fried onions, chimichurri, and red wine cheese. Line moves fast, service is fast, and you can get in and out rather quickly. The only con is the location which if you are taking public transportation can be a bit of a pain to get to but its so worth it if you are visiting Chicago.
