I came here Saturday with a group of 10 people for my birthday dinner. It was fab-u-lous. Every single thing we tried was mouthwatering and delectable. The tomato bread they served at the beginning was the best free bread I've ever had! The waiter suggested the tasting menu, but we decided to order a bunch of tapas and share those instead. I'm glad we did. I think my favorite part of the meal was the dessert croquettes...it's just a bite but very satisfying. The service was great, and the ambiance was hip and luxurious. I think that this place would be good for a date, or a night out with friends. I'll be back!
