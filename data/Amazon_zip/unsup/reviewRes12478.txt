Delivery for Piece SUCKS. I called HOURS in advance for some pizza's and requested very specifically a delivery time. At the time of the order they said it was not a problem. The delivery guy shows up 20+ minutes early.... My guests are not here yet and who wants expensive, cold pizza for dinner, really???  You are better off going and waiting the hour to get your table and pizza at Piece. I am so disgusted with their response "sorry-whoops".... really?
