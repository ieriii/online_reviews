Heck yeah new brewpub in Chicago! Everyone has been waiting for this place to open and it shows. The wait can be out of control for dinner. But at least they have a good amount of space so you can stand around and drink while you wait for a table. The bar seats are first come first serve and you can luck out at times and score a seat there right away. The beer is good, not over the top amazing but good. My current favorite is their gold. It's an easy drinking and refreshing beer. I think they are having trouble keeping up with all the demand for the product because it seems that each time I go there is one less of their beers on tap. Seems like a good problem to have. But don't worry if they ran out of their beer they have a huge selection of other beers on tap and in the bottle. Besides the beer being excellent, the food to go along with it doesn't disappoint. I don't think I can go to Revolution without at least getting something to eat and that usually is the bacon fat popcorn. I've had the farm burger twice and both times it has been the best burger I've had. That's right Kuma lovers, the burger here is better. The bun on the burger it what makes it stand out big time. It's dense and light at the sometime. So delicious! Besides the burger and bacon fat popcorn the pizza is great and the fries are pretty rocking. The mashed potatoes were unbelievable, best I've ever had. Sure right now the wait sucks but it's worth it. I've waited for over two hours twice in the last couple weeks and I'll be doing it again soon. Just suck it up, grab yourself a great locally brewed beer and wait because I don't think you'll be disappointed.
