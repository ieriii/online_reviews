Went here on a Wednesday night, just missed half price burger night, but I have no regrets about paying full price for my burger. I'm not a beer drinker, but I got an Amaretto Stone Sour and was told they make the sour mix in house, which was awesome. I opted for the "make your own burger" option and chose the fries as my side. Both the burger and fries were delicious. The portions were huge, and the fries come with this sauce that has a bit of a kick to it. I ended up putting it on my burger and it tasted great. I could only finish half of my huge burger and the rest was lunch for the next day. Our server was great, attentive and very friendly. I will definitely be making a return visit.
