My husband and I really enjoy the food at Yolk and have been here several times because its in our neighborhood. The wait on the weekends is tough but worth it once you get in. On their menu they advertise their "fresh squeezed" juices (orange, orange strawberry and grapefruit). During our wait today, we saw the waiters pouring that "fresh" juice out of big food service gallon jugs. This is pretty crappy practice especially since they charge an arm and a leg for this juice. I would recommend Yolk for the large menu and tasty food but watch out for the "fresh" claims on the juice.
