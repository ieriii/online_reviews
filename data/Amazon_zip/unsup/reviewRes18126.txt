Fantastic Burgers! Elvis's Last Supper is my favorite. It has bacon and peanut butter on it. The menu says, "trust us, it's good" (or something like that). I did trust them, and I've gone back for it more than 10 times. My wife always gets the Big Texan burger. All the burgers I've tried have been fantastic. It's out of the way for us, but occasionally we'll make a special trip just for the burgers.
