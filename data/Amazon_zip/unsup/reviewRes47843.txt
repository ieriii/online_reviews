I have yet to try their food - we only went for a dessert and coffee last time. BUT, as a bread pudding lover, one word for theirs: DIVINE!! We sit on the rooftop - which was nice, but the whole area downstairs - and the ambiance, were superb! Whether you're there to chill out with your friends after work, or for a first date - they have the right spot for you right there in their vicinity!
