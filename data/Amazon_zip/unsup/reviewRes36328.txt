Indie Caf has three of my most favorite things: sushi, Thai and BYOB. They're pretty much a threesome of fabulousness, so when I can get them all in one place, I'm one satisfied gal. Sexual innuendos aside, Indie Caf is truly a find! Located on an unassuming strip on the 5900 block of Broadway, you may not have ever found this little treasure if you didn't have good reason to make it this far north. Luckily, the Yelpette GNO dinner crew decided to make this their monthly destination! Food: Dear Lord Baby Jesus, I'm in lurve with the crab rangoon. Those little fried pouches of cream cheese and crab yumminess are, as one Yelpette put it, better than Xanax. I also sampled the spicy crab roll. Um, yes, it's spicy. Good thing I can take some heat. Liz M. and I split the stunning White Scorpion roll as well. Jam-packed with tempura crusted soft shell crab, spicy mayo, masago, superwhite tuna and avocado, it is a treat not to be missed! Service: As good as can be expected. It can't be easy to serve a posse of 20 boisterous ladies who brought more bottles of wine and champagne than the number of people in our party. The staff at Indie Caf had us pre-order our appetizers, so those came out super-quickly. Our dinners came out rather staggered, but we did order quite a bit of sushi, and seeing as how Indie Caf is tiny, I'm sure the sushi bar is tiny too! It takes some time to lovingly wrap our maki rolls. Ambience: Decent! We were seated in the "red room." So plush, so sexy. I need to come back on a date. The main "gray room" didn't have the same panache we found in the red room. All in all, a fun dining experience for a fabulous crowd of Yelp ladies. Next time I'm up North, I'll be sure to stop back in.
