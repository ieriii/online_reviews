Never had Chicago style pizza, so while in Chicago, I had to try it. We got a sausage and tomato pizza that was tasty, but the sauce seemed a bit thin and not very flavorful. The crust was nice and flaky, but so thick that 1 slice fills you up. The sausage on the pizza was good, but I just felt underwhelmed. Next time I'm in the area, I will try a less touristy restaurant and see if I get a better impression of Chicago-style stuffed pizza.
