Came here with 2 of my friends for dinner/drinks and really enjoyed it. Ambience is kinda bar scene, new england, type but in a classy kind of way if that makes any sense! Pretty much everyone is sitting around a HUGE table. We had the chicken (lots of yummy seasoning), ahi tuna (very fresh and buttery), and some type of salad, but everything was really good. The place is kind of pricey though. About $50pp including wine/tax/tip.
