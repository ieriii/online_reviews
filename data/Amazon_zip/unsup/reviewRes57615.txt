This is probably the best date place around. It's extremely romantic with the dim lighting and the live music, and the private booths. My boyfriend took me here just for a nice night out- and it was the best dining experience. We had the beef and shrimp fondue which was excellent and it's so much fun to do the fondue ourselves. We had a great time and will be going back.
