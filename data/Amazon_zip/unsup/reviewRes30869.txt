This restaurant is every bit as amazing as people say! We had a group of 6 when we dined there a couple weeks ago. We took the advice of our waitress and ordered a number of items and shared them amongst the group. We had the oxtail potstickers, rock shrimp tempura, lap cheong with walnuts (green beans), tail of two tunas, firecracker roll, dragon roll and rainbow roll. This was plenty of food for all of us! And with wine, tip and dessert, the total bill was $50 per person. I highly recommend!!! Con: It's very loud so if you are hard of hearing or are wanting an intimate dining experience, this isn't the place for you.
