After trying the growler + pizza Sunday special back in February, I finally made it to Piece again this weekend. It was even better than before. I'm a pizza snob, and Piece's white pizza with sausage & mushrooms is as good as it gets. Their stout is awesome and so is their Golden Arm Just one question though...where is your Top Heavy Hefeweizen??!!
