We came here for my birthday... on the day... of the Gay Pride Parade. BOY was THAT an experience!! We enjoyed the parade through the open windows. Hahaha! Anyway, the waiter we had was so friendly and helpful, I loved it. The chips were good ... we kept eating them because we had no idea what we wanted to order. They're the kind I would peg as authentic, even though I'm not Hispanic. The table shared a pitcher of mango-strawberry margarita, and it was strong, but delicious! Nothing I could make could compare. (Wait, does it sound like I make a lot of drinks...?) We all ordered something different, and it all tasted great. The plates are humongous! After the entree, there is no room for dessert, so if you come, try to conserve some of that space to try a dessert! I would love to hear about the desserts here! PS - I noticed the Yelp sticker on the door, too!!
