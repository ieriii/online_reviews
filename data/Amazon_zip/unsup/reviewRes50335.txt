This was my second time at Big Jones, and I loved it just as much this time. I ordered the crawfish, andouille and cream cheese omelet, which was really good. The accompanying grits were ok, but lacked flavor. The goat cheese biscuits were good, but I couldn't understand where the goat cheese came into play. Maybe it was in the buttery spread, which tasted homemade and delicious. I tried the eggs benedict with back bacon, and also had a taste of the fried green tomatoes, all of which was really good. The duck confit waffles were also really good, they were a mixture of sweet and savory (though I would have preferred more savory, less sweet). Overall, the food was delicious. My party arrived before I did and I'm told there was some confusion with the hostess regarding whether the table was ready or not, which resulted in awkward waiting in a narrow entranceway. The service once we sat down was really slow. They actually brought us an extra plate of beignets because our order was taking so long. I can forgive all this, however, because I just loved the food so much. Mmmm.
