I've been to Giordano's once before on a previous ND vs. USC trip, and the second time around was just as good. It was a different location, but just as good as I remembered. When the server suggests an appetizer because the pizza takes a while to cook, take the advice. We were hungry as we walked in, but we did not take the server's appetizer advice. We sat there for some time before changing our mind about the appetizer - it was a great call. Within a few minutes after munching on our appetizer, the pizza was out. The pizza is dense and it's filled oh-so-yummy goodness. YUMMY! I can't wait til this Fall for another ND football game weekend. Good stuff.
