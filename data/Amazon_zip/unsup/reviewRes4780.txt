Amazing food, great atmosphere, knowledgeable bartender. Ask to try wines and they allowed it until you found the right one, which is great. The outside is totally cute and we sat at the bar to eat. The Caesar salad was fantastic and so was the bone marrow (amaaazing!) Will DEF go back here when we visit Chicago again.
