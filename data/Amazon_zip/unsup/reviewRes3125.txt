This place is delicious! Our first experience at Crisp was a very small meal but we'll be back to try more for sure. We ordered 5 wings, fries and a drink all to share. The portions are great - the chicken wings are a great size (they come with the drum and the wing so it's really like getting 10 wings from any other place I've been to). The wings were so juicy and the sauce is out of this world - we had the Seoul Sassy sauce. The fries were good, but standard. I wonder if they have something like the kimchee fries from Del Seoul but I didn't see them on the menu, probably should have asked. If they don't have something like that it would be a great addition to the menu!
