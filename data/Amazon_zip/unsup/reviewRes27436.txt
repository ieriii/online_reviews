I think 2 hours is the longest I've ever waited for a table (guess I should expect that on a Saturday night at 7:30pm) but I'm happy I did it here! I managed to snag a bar table with 3 friends, so we had some drinks and apps while we waited. Here's what I tried: Apps: Tostadas de Ceviche de Hongos - like a Mexican Bruschetta - yummy, but all too small for the price. Chips and guacamole - very good, can't go wrong with chips/guac! Drinks: Some margarita with Brandy - damn it was good, but I can't remember which one it was! The 2 Brothers IPA was excellent as well. Dinner: Falda Asada Brava - Spicy and tender. The side of sweet corn tamales with a creamy cheese topping was awesome, almost dessert-like. Carne Asada - very marbelized, which meant it was fatty but also very full of flavor! The side of guacamole almost seemed misplaced and there was nothing to eat it with, but if you're a guac fan I guess you'd eat it plain. Sides: Platanos con Crema - Cheese with plantains sounds weird to those who haven't tried but it's actually amazing! Dessert: Chocolate pecan pie - topped with khalua whipped creme, it was fantastic! It was definitely enough to share between 4 people, especially after such a large meal. When we left it was about 10pm and there were many empty tables, so if you avoid the dinner rush, you should!
