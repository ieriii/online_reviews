Damn I love this place. I have two staples: 1) Farfalle pollo when im looking for a little pasta action and 2) small order of spinach salad with grilled chicken. it is seriously the best salad ever- and im not a salad person. It's got fresh grilled chicken, goat cheese, green spinach, tomatoes, YUM! I'm all about the delivery and take out here- I've got PB in my phone. Eating in is nice but I've actually also had some bald rude server before...i'd prefer to eat my salad in the comfort of my own home, which happens to be right next door to PB. Best part is, they don't make fun of me for getting delivery:)
