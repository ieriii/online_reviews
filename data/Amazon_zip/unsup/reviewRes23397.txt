Let me just say, I love Saganaki! I have had Greek food before but have never had the chance to try this, and boy I was blown away! If you love to eat those crusty-topped blobs of cheese that slide off pizza slices then your heaven= saganaki. So this restaurant is really beautiful on the inside, has free valet parking and very professional staff. The prices were very reasonable and I tried a couple new food items, which always makes me happy! My husband had the spinach pie, which was the best I've ever tasted, and I got the vegetarian platter, which I really liked about 2/3 of the stuff included. I can't wait to eat my hot lima beans tomorrow.
