First off, both the sweet and savory crepes were good. They tasted fresh with tons of flavor. I don't know about what other people are used to but I didn't think the portion size was all that big/filling. I think you can get more food for the money over at Reza's (quality too). The atmosphere was interesting, and they put something into the presentation of the food. Overall things were fine, pretty good, but nothing special. Maybe from the reviews I was expecting more, to be wowed, but I wasn't. Personally, I didn't think the prices were high given how they are trying to offer a unique experience, in detail. I doubt I'll be back (especially not if I'm really hungry). Not a bad food experience but I've experienced better crepes, and many times over-better Middle Eastern food.
