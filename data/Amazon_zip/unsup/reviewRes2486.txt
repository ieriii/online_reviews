Wow! This place really makes some damn good hot dogs. We were heading back home to SF and made the trip on our way back to the airport and prayed that there wasn't going to be a long line. Well we were in luck. It is Tuesday around 2:30 in the afternoon. Still a line, but not wrapping around the block as we feared. We tried a whole bunch of different hot dogs and they were all very good. Being very critical of our hot dogs we had discussion about whether this actually beats out Top Dog from the San Francisco area. I will have to admit that Hot Dougs comes up on top here. Everything we had was oh so yummy. We pretty much tried out half the menu or more. One of the ladies ordered the Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage. This thing is super good, but really heavy. She had to get something different since it was rich and she couldn't handle since we ate right before this too. This means I got more than one bite....yummy, yummy, yummy!!!
