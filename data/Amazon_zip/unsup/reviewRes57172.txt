I have been to this restaurant several times since moving to Chicago three years ago, however the last few visits have been very disappointing. After tonight, however, I will never go back for food. There was simply too much salt in the food (from the chips & guac to our main entrees), and when I asked to provide feedback to the chef (or one of the sous chefs), I was told that one of them could come out, but then later that they were too busy. I hardly ate my pollo (chicken) because I felt like it was loaded with salt, and our waitress (Christina) never asked us how the food was so I didn't have the opportunity to even think about sending it back. The portion sizes are way too big as well. I hope that somehow this feedback gets to the chef, who needs to make some changes if this restaurant is going to survive.
