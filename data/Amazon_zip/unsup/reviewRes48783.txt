Ok, so I'll admit, I don't drink. Lets just get that out of the way and move on. Yes, craft beers and fun cocktails, blah, blah, blah. Lets talk about the food! Party of 2 (date night), seated on the patio on a beautiful summer night. I'm glad we were outside because the inside was a little loud for me. Might be fun with a bigger group though. We started the night with a market salad and pork rinds. The market salad was incredibly fresh and each bite had different flavors in it. Delicious. We chatted with the waitress briefly about the rinds and she told us they are cut from pork skin everyday! I never knew you could get fresh rinds! They came out tossed in vinegar and cayenne (?). Absolutely delightful! They were still popping. I would say, I could eat 12 more orders and not think anything of it. For entrees, I had the country ribs. While I'm used to a Kansas City rib slathered in sauce, these were brined or marinated and were fantastic. Tender, juicy and had a great charred flavor. My date had the shrimp boil and he enjoyed it (though I couldn't taste it due to a food allergy). We shared sides of corn and frites. The frites were good, but the corn was amazing! Dressed with a fresh cream of some sort and spice mixture, topped with parmesan.  We finished the night with a waffle with honey butter and jam. It was a little strange for a dessert choice, but delicious none the less. I'm usually one that cares much more about food than service, but I was pleasantly surprised by the service. She was super informed, polite, and attentive, without being pushy or overbearing. Overall, a great food experience.
