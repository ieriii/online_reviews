I am a bit new to the world of ultra high-end dining, but Alinea was a truly special experience. Every course was excellent, many were unforgettable. In addition, dinner at Alinea is part theater part meal. Nearly every course is presented in an elaborate, clever, and playful way. At many restaurants I would disdain such gimmickry, but Alinea pulls it off and then some. The quality and flavor of the food does not suffer one bit due to such flare.  Favorite course were the black truffle explosion (an impossibly rich, single bite, ravioli filled with a black truffle emulsion), winter in New Hampshire (a beautiful presentation of peppermint snow topped with a few sweet bites) and a fish dish served family style.  I may never eat a more inventive or delicious meal in my life. That said, I believe the food to be EVERY bit as good at Charlie Trotters (my other high end dining experience), minus a bit of the wizardry that makes Alinea special and at a slightly lower price. I highly recommend a trip there before it closes later this year. Service was impeccable, one anecdote can explain it all. I spilled a tiny drop of syrup from the dessert course on my jacket cuff. I noticed it, and started dabbing it with my napkin. Without me saying a word, and within SECONDS, a waiter produced a shout wipe and presented it to me on a plate with another napkin. Very impressive. The atmosphere of the place was really cool, modern decor, soft colorful lighting, and beautiful architecture. We got a peek at the kitchen after dinner, and it was amazing to think that 20 amazing courses come from such a small room. Really cool to see the chefs at work for a few minutes.  I did do the wine paring (my companions did not). All the wine was great, but I am a bit of a novice when it comes to wine and I am not sure it was worth it (for me). Next time I might just split a good bottle or two.
