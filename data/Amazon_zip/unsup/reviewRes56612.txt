I was in with a friend on sat without a reservation and it was so crowded! I was able to find a seat at a table in the bar (thank god because we were moody, hungry and about to leave). We ended up having a great time! My server, Lee was awesome! She really turned the night around for us. She made some great suggestions (from delicious wines to yummy bone-in filets and au gratin potatoes) and was right on point. Also, the bar was so beautiful with great atmosphere. I loved the singer too! I will be back soon but probably during the week when hopefully it won't be so busy.ps-You must try the desserts! (butter cake esp)
