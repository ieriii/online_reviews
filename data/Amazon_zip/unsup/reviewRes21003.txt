i was really impressed. tortas are not my thing, and i am intimidated by the soup-things. but the torta i got was fantastic. i got the suckling pig one...they warned me about the habanero salsa. and it was the (best-tasting) hottest thing i have ever eaten. i got the beer they suggested and it was great. with the chips and salsa it was totally worth what it cost. i will go back...i definitely want the wednesday/pork belly special. AND I HATE MYSELF FOR NOT GETTING THE CHURROS WITH HOT CHOCOLATE. next time. i actually dont mind the ordering/sitting situation-especially because i was by myself. i got their early enough so it was comfortable, but as i was leaving it was like body-to-body. anywho i would love to try more! BAYLESS FOR LIFE
