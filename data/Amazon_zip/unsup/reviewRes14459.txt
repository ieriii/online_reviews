Yum!!! What a nice and surprising restaurant on a cold November night. The atmosphere was super chill on a Monday night and our waitress was very attentive and sweet. We loved the fireplace and the wrap around bar as well as the multi-tiered seating. The upper seating gives a sense of privacy while still looking over the whole bar. There's so much great food and beer to be had here. We had the chartucherie platter filled with delicious sausage and ham goodness. I went on to have the mussels in the white ale sauce while the hubs had the Flemish stew (the cream cheese garlic mashed potatoes are devine).  Both meals were perfectly paired with our really smooth and tasty beers and really hit the spot on a cool fall evening. We finished off with the molten lava pumpkin fritters which tasted like little fried pieces of pumpkin pie. Delish!! We left very content and full with leftovers in hand. We're coming back here to try the bacon popcorn and the pork shoulder pizza soon. Very soon.
