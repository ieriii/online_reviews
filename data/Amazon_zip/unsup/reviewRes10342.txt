Pizza. Brewery. Live band Karaoke. (WIN, WIN, & WIN!) Late night in Wicker Park. If you're hungry, want to drink, and don't mind loud live music...come on in!  This joint is casual and fun. If you are looking to get a table, the place can get very packed on weekend nights, so come early. It can also get pretty loud, so be forewarned. Don't let that discourage you from coming with a group. Live Band Karaoke (Friday nights i think) was loads of fun.  Piece cooks up some awesome thin crust pizza. I can't blame them though...I was the one who told them exactly what sauce / toppings I wanted on my custom pizza! I haven't tried their other food. Piece cooks up some delicious brews. Take your favorite Piece beer home in a growler! The waitstaff was very friendly and attentive, not to mention knowledgeable regarding the drink menu. This comes in handy for noobs venturing to try craft beer for the first time. Put down the domestic & pop that micro-brew cherry! *Support your local breweries!
