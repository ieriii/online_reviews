Let me start by saying that I am not a big fan of Italian food. I enjoy it once in a while, but will usually opt for spicier food. That said, I really enjoyed my meal at Calo. To start, the bread was fresh and amazing. The ribs, which we ordered as appetizers, were cooked to perfection. I ordered the Lobster ravioli with asparagus and sundried tomatoes, a yummy garlic sauce and some grilled shrimp to top it off. It was delicious. We also ordered the Calo special thin crust pizza, which tasted even better the next day. For dessert, we had the flourless chocolate cake....a must do.  Pros - free parking, delicious food, good selection of wine, great ambience and not necessarily in that order. Cons - they ran out of the wine we initially asked for, somewhat on the pricier side (although well worth it). I totally ate too much....but I would not change a thing. You have to try this place. I will definitely go back.
