I recently stayed overnight at the City Suites. It was chosen due to the close proximity to the point of my visit to Chicago. I could not have got more lucky! So close to so many restaurants and shops, and as many have mentioned, the subway. Again not for light sleepers! The staff here was so helpful and really accommodating of all of my random and somewhat demanding requests. The rooms and common areas are clean and well kept. One of the nicest hotel bathrooms I have ever seen! The lobby was so quaint and throughout may stay had guests just relaxing & chatting by the fireplace. My first choice for a hotel in this area and I will be back.
