Friday, early dinner around 6:00. Had the pasta bolognese, the gf had the gnocchi, both were awesome. The wait staff was courteous and always checked up on us. They had great mojitos as well! :D Sat on the outdoor section, which is right next to the street, but luckily its not very busy. We had a great time, will definitely go back here!
