I think this place is nice. I mean, yeah, there are usually children here and the place can be crowded and it is, as one yelper put it, kitschy, but it's not a bad place for reasonable food, a decent salad bar and I happen to think the kitschyness is kinda cute. It's an upbeat kinda place with a coziness to it. The lights are dimmed and there are old pictures everywhere. They play classic rock usually and a mix of 80s. I liked it. The first time I went was with my boyfriend. It was an afternoon and I was hungover. I mean, death hungover. I got a burger and a coke. I think the coke was really what had the magical healing powers (being loaded with sugar - I was probably in desperate need of sugar as I pretty much expelled all of my stomach contents the night before) but that burger! I couldn't handle the cheese so I just kinda scraped it off, but delish! I chowed down about half of it. That was as much as a girl can handle. There chip/fries are yummy too. I like to dip 'em in ketchup. The 2nd time I went I got the Thanksgiving on a bun. Turkey, mashed potato (I think), stuffing a tiny bit of cranberry sauce and gravey. Oh my oh my. How I wish I could have that thing everyday. I don't think Thanksgiving on a bun is always available, and now that it's nearly Christmas it's probably gone, but definately worth going to Grunt's for. Anyway (geez this is long) there always seems to be a wait. Tons of people waiting for this place. My boyfriend and I have happened to go twice and there was no wait, so if there's no wait and you're hungry, and around the area you should give this place a chance.
