I've been to this restaurant twice. Once at night, when the crowd had their noses so far in the clouds, I felt if I ate anything I'd be misconstrued as a fat ass that needed lipo. Overpriced maki, but good...this was clearly a place that was a "be seen" place over food quality. Second time, lunch. Tried a gDine deal. For those not familiar w/ gDine...I recommend it to A. try multiple dishes at a new place B. get a great deal. I think our gDine was $19/person for 4 courses. The trick...you get a special menu, that may seem a bit limited. But hey, it's 4 courses and it's under $20. First course: app (spicy tuna roll, 3 pieces) Second course: soup (miso that was basically just broth) Third course: eck. This was a bummer. The menu contained mainly curries, which I thought was interesting, based on the huge sushi/maki list from my previous visit. I went for a shrimp, cod and sea bass curry, my bf for chicken katsu curry. His curry came out coagulated, almost like beef gravy that had been setting for like a half hour. WIth a dry and flattened panko chicken breast. It would've been a better stew, just wasn't fit for a curry. Mine came out wrong. It wasn't even what I ordered. But...they quickly got it right and it was quite delicious and flavorful. Fourth course: a delicious combo of mochi with dipping sauces. Hands down, my favorite part of lunch...and I'm not even a sweets person. Maybe I'd go there again? Too many restaurants in Chicago for mediocre food, so I'm on the fence.
