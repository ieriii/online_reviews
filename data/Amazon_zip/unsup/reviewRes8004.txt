I'm pretty sure that "Woohoo! As good as it gets!" describes Fogo in the Brazilian steakhouse category.  The service is really astounding. Try dropping a fork or knife. I guarantee almost within seconds someone will hand you a replacement. By the end of the meal I almost forget who my server is because there are about 10 people clearing plates on your table, asking if you need a drink refill, wondering if there is some sort of meat you are waiting for to come around. The food is delicious. The salad bar is delicious, the sides are delicious, and the meat, of course, is delicious. Everything is fresh and well-cooked. My brother, who is the biggest steak fan I know, has this restaurant in his cell phone so they he can make a reservation by simply pressing a few buttons. Top that. I tend to give many restaurants that I enjoy four stars, but I really can't think of one Brazilian steakhouse I have been to that tops this one.
