We had early reservations for a Saturday (6PM) which I'm thankful for in hindsight. I went with my husband and we were seated at the far end of one of the long tables nearest to the kitchen. They sat us on a corner so we each only had one other diner on either side of us. Thank goodness the waiter explained the menu for us because we didn't know how much to order. We ended up splitting all of our plates and went with taste of three hams, the white sausage, scallops, the sweet potatoes and kale, and apple salad. I don't plan on ordering the same thing there again so I am glad we did the taste of three hams for our first visit. The goat butter was outstanding and the hams were salty and creamy and wonderful! The scallops were the best I've ever had, the white sausage was my husband's favorite of the evening. I haven't heard much about the desserts but I have to say the mint chocolate chip ice cream was the the most pure mint flavored ice cream I have ever tasted. We also ordered the apple cobbler - outstanding as well.  Can't drink so I did not sample any wine or beer. They do have a nice jasmine tea. My husband had one beer that he enjoyed. It took a little bit to get used to the communal dining experience but the food is worth it. The servers are on top of everything - clearing plates, refilling water, checking in on you. Great customer service by the hostess too. The communal sink outside of the restrooms is a cutesy idea, but the handicap restrooms are equipped with the sink if you do not want to wash your hands with strangers.
