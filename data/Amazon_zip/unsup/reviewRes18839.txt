My friend suggested this place, knowing that I would love it. Smart cookie. We had the poutine and I had the salmon sandwich. The smoked salmon was like salmon pastrami, with spices on the edges and blew my mind. I was so stuff after the poutine, I just did the no carbs thing and ate all the salmon even when I was past full. Plus the location can't be beat.
