Dinner last night was amazing. Every single bite, every taste, was absolutely delicious. Met Exec Chef Michael before we sat down and chatted food for awhile (I used to cook/cater gourmet), so maybe that's why he sent over some extra plates for us, but we got out for $60 for two (we did skip drinks, didn't want to snooze off in the ballet). Had the spinach salad, incredible. Pork belly with apple, twas like meat-candy, delicious. Lamb chops were perfect, much better than I had at Emil's the night before. Bread with tomato spread, sort of like bruschetta but easier to eat, amazing; I could have eaten a pound of just that. Topped off with chocolate-filled croquettes that were positively orgasmic; we literally wiped the plate clean with our fingers, couldn't let one bit go to waste. Wonderful service (although as others have mentioned, several times dishes that weren't ours were brought to our table.) All in all, a spectacular meal and I WILL be back to try everything else on the menu. Bravo, Michael!
