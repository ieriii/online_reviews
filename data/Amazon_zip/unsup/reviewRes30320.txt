The hallmark of a stellar vegetarian restaurant is one that makes me have second thoughts about giving up meat. A place that makes me say, "You know, this mimics the meaty counterpart with the right flavor and texture, I can do away with meat." Of course I probably will never totally give in to the un-chicken, fake meat, mock duck, "Beef", unless there is a pandemic of bird flu, swine flu, mad cow, sky rocket mercury levels in the ocean occurring as a catastrophic rapture-like event. Mind you, my diet is vegetarian 39.5% of the time because my friends are pescatarian/vegetarian and not to mention it's a lower calorie meal. Nevertheless, Chicago Diner is the equivalent to the Viceroy butterfly species, with mimicry at it's finest. It gets 5 stars for my 5 seconds of hesitation until I realize it's not the same hormone pumped poisonous butterfly.
