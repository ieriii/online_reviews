Gluttony. We were craving some good seafood while visiting Chicago and Shaw's Crab House was incredibly satisfying. We ordered the STEAMED ALASKAN RED KING CRAB LEGS. A whole pound of juicy, plump, sweet crab! Hands down, THE best crab I have ever had. The shell was very easy to crack, therefore I was a happy eater. We also ordered the lobster boil which was a whole Maine Lobster, Boiled Red Potatoes, Corn on the Cob & Cole Slaw. Mmmmm MmMM mMmmmm I can't even describe how amazing this meal was. Definitely order the lobster and crab. Skip on the mac and cheese side dish because it was disappointing. Service as impeccable! For dessert? Raspberry pie a la mode. If I'm ever in Chicago again, I'm definitely dining at Shaw's.
