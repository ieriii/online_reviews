Mmmm. Greek Islands. Just thinking about the food is making me salivate. While the location is a little out of the way for me (I live in Printer's Row), I am willing to drive or take a cab... this is coming from the girl who scrounges through the couch cushions for cash. The food is just THAT good. The staff is very personable, yet efficient and quick. The same people have been running the restaurant in the last 15 years I have been there, and they remember my family every time we eat there. I've always had great service here. Try the Saganaki, aka flaming cheese. Great presentation, they do the whole "Opa!" thing. The Greek Salad, Mediterranean Chicken Breast, Moussaka, and Baklava are to DIE FOR! Coming here on a Sunday after a Bears game sucks, so try and avoid it if you can. It's not so much the crowding that sucks, it's the drunk, obnoxious, middle-aged men (sorry if I offended anyone)! Oh, and free valet. What else could you want?
