I enjoyed q! It was nice to try a BBQ restaurant in the Gold Coast that also didn't cost an arm and a leg! That of course is if you don't get a Whole Pork Shoulder! That will cost you $305.00! I had the Kobe Chopped Brisket sandwich with Poblano Cheddar Cornbread. I like my meal but I like my wife's better! She was wise and got the Pulled Pork Shoulder. The pulled pork was very tasted. They have three types of BBQ sauces to try. I like them all and they were all good however they were not the best BBQ sauce I have ever had either. The service was great! Our waiter was very helpful and the our water was always being filled. I really enjoyed the homemade chips and bread & butter pickles they brought out before our meal. Be careful not to eat to much though. The meal is pretty filling!
