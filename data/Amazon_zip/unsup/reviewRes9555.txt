I was one of those friends who went with Brandon C. and although it was last year, our time at Le Colonial was so memorable I wanted to add a few details to the night: The duck breast dish our friend ordered was so superb I've been trying to recreate my duck experience ever since, and have failed. I ordered a curry dish, and it was good curry, but I kicked myself a little for ordering the wrong thing. After tasting everyone else's, I realized I should have ordered one of the more traditional dishes. They know what their doing with their flavor combos. Our waiter was indeed wonderful, attentive, and also patient -- I remember it took me quite a while to order a drink, the wine menu was quite extensive, but he was very helpful when I asked for directions. We ended up with a delicious Rose and then specialty drink there, I believe it was champagne mixed with an exotic fruit juice (perhaps lychee) and it was phenomenal. Aside from the food quality being outstanding, the atmosphere, the concept, and the management impressed us as well. As I passed the host on my way to the restroom, I commented that we really enjoyed everything. The manager then brought us dessert (a delectable flourless chocolate cake dressed with REAL raspberry drizzle) and wanted to thank US for joining them. I'm not from Chicago either, and so meeting with friends for 'a night on the town' would not have been the same without Le Colonial. It is a must-try
