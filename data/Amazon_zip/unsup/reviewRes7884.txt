Fogo de Chao, Brazzaz, and Texas de Brazil are the key Chicago Brazilian steakhouses. I haven't tried Texas de Brazil yet, but between the other two, I have to recommend Brazzaz. Three reasons: 1. Brazzaz has fried plantains (bananas?) as a side, while Fogo de Chao offers bananas that are a bit too sweet and soggy. Brazzaz wins on sides. 2. Fogo de Chao doesn't have shrimp. 3. Brazzaz has more of an upscale feel, which is difficult to specify, but I've noticed it each time I'm there. The line between Fogo de Chao and Brazzaz may be thin, but even so I prefer Brazzaz.
