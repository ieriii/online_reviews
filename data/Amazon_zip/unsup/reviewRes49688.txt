Daughter's favorite place, so had to be 1st place visited on 12/23/11 for appetizers & drinks. So I went & no wonder she loves it! Imaginative & creative combine with an extensive wine list & an equally amazing cheese selection. Flights of wine & samplers of cheese are not unique. I've had others, but this is an impressive menu, great atmosphere, offered up by a knowledgeable staff. You've got to check it out!
