By far the best place in the city to grab drinks, undisturbed. Pricey? YES. Worth it? YES.  I have never had to wait like some other yelpers, but I come reasonably early, for that exact reason. The decor has a dark, romantic charm about it. When I am with a friend, we usually sit at the bar and watch them mix up drinks. When I am on a date, the high backed chairs provide the right amount of privacy. The drinks are strong, which is why the price is worth it. This is not a place you spend all night pounding them back, if so go across the street to Ohm or Tavern whatever its called. This is a place you sit and relax, and unwind. I am not crazy about their food, but this is not a place for food.
