I love the selection of beers and the absence of a TV. It's a cool bar with a clientele that's older and smarter. The food can be hit or miss- some nights I have had excellent meals and service here. Hopleaf is not consistent as far as food is concerned- I have had great steak, but also have had rouch not so great steak.. my friend always get the mussels -which can be excellent, but last time made him ill. The food used to be top notch for a bar type place- but I'd say it depends on the night. I haven't figured out when its outstanding. I miss those days! The service is a big issue- in the restaurant area- we had spent 80 bucks eating- they were kicking people off the patio because it has to close at midnight- so instead of making sure we still had a place to sit and finish the expensive bottle we ordered- we were rushed inside- found a table upstairs which they said was also closed and to "get out". If we paid all that money- we at least need a place to finish what we ordered - there was no seats in the bar.. that was pretty crappy. We got the check of course and were being rushed to pay- but what about the fact that people were in the middle of a nice meal and you have all these seats and are telling them they have to leave. The waitstaff isn't exactly great- and we have seen confusion about seating- they don't really do a great job of checking in with you- but that's not the big issue for me.  Another night- not too busy for a friday the bartender was kind of snippy for no reason- I guess that's common from what friends say- I'm sorry but for a 7$ beer if all you are doing is opening a bottle for me- be civil- you work for tips! I am not demanding or difficult.  I do like Hopleaf, but wish they would concentrate on good service, and consistent food.
