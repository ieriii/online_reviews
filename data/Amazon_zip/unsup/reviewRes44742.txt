THE BEST Chicago Deep Dish pizza... hands down. I especially like the spinach one. If I have out of town guest who want to try Chicago style pizza, I take them here. Now, there are some things you do have to note: 1. If you are going to eat here, make sure that you like the person that you a going here with. The wait for seating can be long. If you are ordering a deep dish pizza, it does take 45- 1 hour to cook. 2. See note above, do not stuff yourself on salad or drinks because 3. One slice of deep dish pizza is a meal. No, seriously. All that cheesy tomato goodness is A LOT. This is Chicago Style Pizza!! This Pizza is thick and hearty enough to start a bar brawl. I prefer to go in the middle of the week. Too bad its soooo bad for you!
