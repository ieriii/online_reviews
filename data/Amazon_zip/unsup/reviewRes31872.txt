I have heard great things about Demera, and it was definitely well worth the price. The food itself is an experience, and pretty tasty. The waitresses were helpful albeit not very friendly. I recommend the lamb and the carrot/cabbage. The dessert volcano was probably the worst dessert I have ever had, but we still had loads of fun there and would definitely go back again. I do recommend it, even though my hands smelled like beef for 24 hours.
