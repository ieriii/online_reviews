I actually liked Pequod's better before the renovations. Don't get me wrong, it's a nice place still, actually nicer than it was before which is my problem. Before it felt like the kind of pizza pub you would go to after a softball game. Shabby old carpet and chairs, punky looking waitstaff, and your cheap beer. A dive. Now it's all nice wood floors, nice bar, flatscreen TVs. Nice bathrooms (I guess that's ok.) At least the pizza hasn't changed. I would say this is my second favorite deep dish after My Pie. It's all in the burnt/caramelized crust. I don't know why it's so good. It just is.
