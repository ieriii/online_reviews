I decided to try this chain during my first visit to Chicago, and their deep stuffed pizza did not disappoint. I was so full from only one slice that my family and I (3 of us in total) had to take the rest of the individual pizza (said to serve 1-2 people) to go. The service is friendly, but once the restaurant gets busy (by 1pm, the whole place was PACKED for lunch), the service is slow and frustrating. I don't blame the waitresses since they have to manage 10 tables at once, but with such a successful chain, you'd think the managers would hire some more help to please their numerous customers.
