Do you want raw egg in your cocktails? You should. Fantastic cocktails in a fun space. My advice? Go during the week or early on the weekends. We waited inside the first, non-descript first door for about 45 minutes, even though there were only 4-5 people in front of us. Also, the crowd got a little riled up about who was here first, etc. and made the tight space even more uncomfortable. Once we got past the magic curtain, though, it was happy times. I had the Short Bus drink to start which was velvety and sweet with the richness of egg yolks pretty much rocking my gin-soaked world that night. On the lighter side of the egg, I opted for the gilded cage as my second, clear-liquor drink and LOVED the frothiness of the egg white and spices sprinkled on top, reminding me of a lighter version of egg nog. I sipped some of a few other drinks, but the only other one that really stayed with me was El Diablo. It's basically a margarita taste, but the best margarita you've EVER HAD. Recommended. We were hungry, so we tried the food which isn't outrageously priced or terrible, but next time, I'll stick to the drinks. Their mini philly cheese steaks were on bread that was borderline toasted and burned and the hummus plate was standard and boring. The flavor all around the food was lacking and just couldn't compare to what we were getting from the bar. I like the no cell phone policy and the atmosphere, though I'd stick to smaller groups since it would be hard to get a seat with a larger crowd and also hard to hear, I'd think. The candlelight is both romantic and 'exclusive". Our server was great, though she did seem to get a bit overwhelmed as the night went on and we waited longer and longer for drinks, checks, etc. Next time I'm looking for some incredible cocktails that are worth every cent of the price ($12), I'm headed to Violet Hour.
