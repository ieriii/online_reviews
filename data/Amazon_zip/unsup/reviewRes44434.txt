Attractive dining room, eclectic bar, attentive service. We tried the chef's sampler of 4 random maki rolls ($22) - good deal and yummy choices. In addition LOVED the Kani Chung roll (had to get it b/c of the name alone)! OK wine selection but it is BYOB so the potential is there. Felt a little rushed by the server (it was prime time on a Saturday night)... but should you rush out the 2 girls drinking wine and tasting sushi - now there's potential!!!
