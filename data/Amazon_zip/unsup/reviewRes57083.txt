Excellent, excellent burger and beer. I tried their Bottom Up Belgian Wit with a Smokehouse burger that was just awesome. Great flavors for both...I tried the a couple of the other beers that people had at my table and they were all enjoyable.It's a bit pricy, but not outrageous, and definitely loud, but I will be back for sure.
