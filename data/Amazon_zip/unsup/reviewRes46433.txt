While on a business trip in Chicago, I had plenty of restaurants to choose from, but I chose Grand Lux Cafe for the convenience and the close proximity to my downtown hotel. I sooo agree with the many reviewers about this restaurant, that they had a similar feel to the Cheesecake Factory. First impression is that I was not overly impressed with the greeters to the restaurant when I walked in. Maybe due to the fact that the greeters are on the first floor and the restaurant is on the second floor. I saw what appeared to be a disconnect with the restaurant and the greeters. Anyways....with my time away from entertaining clients, I went to the bar and intended to eat a late lunch and a drink. The bartenders were very friendly and accomodating. I asked about several items in the menu and settled for the "Chicken Carmel and Rice". When I got my main dish....WOW....large portions and tastes were spot on to Cheesecake Factory standards. I would return here if this restaurant were back at home, but because I am on a business trip in a city that has other restaurants, I will choose someplace else because of the lack of something unique to Grand Lux Cafe (aka Cheesecake Factory). But hats off to you.....you do have great food and service!
