THE BEST SPICY ASIAN FOOD YOU WILL EVER EAT IN YOUR LIFE. Here's a list of what I get every time I go...been coming to this place for over 10 years and loving it every time. Remember......you come to Chinatown for food, not service, so stop griping! lol...and FOOD is greater than service. Their spicy cabbage is yummy~! Dry Chili Chicken (A Chef favorite) Dry Chili Prawns or Dry Chili Shrimp (if you dont like the shell) Salt & Pepper Scallop Dry Chili Pork (i call this dry chili bacon as that is what it looks like) Broiled Beef or Pork is Spicy Szechuan Sauce (Also, anythign with black bean sauce is always delicious!) If you don''t like this place, there is something wrong with you as all who come here would agree.....you won't be disappointed. **Note: If you are one of those people who go to Chinese restaurants to order the "American Chinese" dishes like kung pao chicken, sweet & sour pork, egg foo young, fried rice, etc....don't bother eating here or ordering those" You must order form the "Real Chinese Menu"....if you don't you will probably gripe about the price, and no one likes whiners lol =)
