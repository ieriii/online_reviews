I've been wanting to try this place forever - glad i finally did! We all started with drinks - mine was a martini with papaya and was delicious! I ordered the vegetarian comal and it was GREAT. Tons of grill vegetables (mushrooms, beans, squash asparagus, etc) with tortillas, a couple sauces and sour cream. I wish I could have eaten it all but there was so much I just couldn't. Don't know about desserts, we were all so full from dinner we took a pass - my two companions ate every last bit of their entrees. My only complaint would be that they have a surprisingly small number of vegetarian options (maybe just one?)But I'll definitely be back.
