Had lunch with friends on a Saturday. I had reservations and the table was ready to go upon arrival. Really fantastic service! Attentive, funny, engaging, big smile. What more can you ask for from a server? Loved the food. We had omelets, plantains, catfish, Eggs New Orleans (my order really tasty and satisfying, eggs poached perfectly), grits, bacon (nice and thick, heh heh), and that slightly sweet thick sliced bread with salted butter and that rich dark jammy thing. Heaven! I was full and still managed to shove down two more slices. Had a sazerac, a bit pricey at $12 but a cocktail is necessary at brunch with fun friends, no?
