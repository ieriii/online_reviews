Come on, what's not to like about Grand Lux? Yeah, it's chock full of tourists and sometimes it can take about hundred years to get a table, but what were you expecting from a big, giant corporate chain on Michigan Avenue? It's impossible to not find something to eat here, the menu is gigantic. The prices are reasonable and the portions are enormous. I'm quite partial to the Chicken Piccata, mostly because it comes slathered in this awesome lemon cream sauce that I can't get enough of. Drinks are delicious, affordable and sizeable. Love the room that faces Michigan with the giant windows, cozy two top booths and beautiful light fixtures. I heard they were Chihuly... pretty cool. Anyone who has ill things to say about this place just doesn't belong here and should've gone somewhere else. This place does not make any false claims - it is a tourist trap, but it is pretty good!  To be entirely honest, I think my only problem with it is that their to go containers to not fit properly in their to go bags. For a place that probably averages at least one to go box per table (I repeat, the portions are gigantic - my chicken piccata fed me for lunch and dinner the next day.), they really ought to have a better system, because I was really grossed out when I had to fish my sticky leftovers out of an equally sticky plastic bag. Where are the flat bottomed bags, people? You're a corporate chain, get with it!
