I can quite honestly say that this was the best restaurant experience of my life. I took my boyfriend here for his 26th birthday and the wait staff was amazing. I easily made a reservation on the restaurant's website and as soon as we walked in they knew us by name. I mentioned that it was my boyfriend's birthday and everyone who spoke to us wished him a happy birthday. We felt so welcome! The food and drinks were amazing, too. I got their stuffed chicken breast which was literally the best chicken I have ever eaten. The chicken was supremely moist and the cheese it was stuffed with was heavenly. My boyfriend got some steak (I'm not much of a steak eater, sorry, don't remember what kind/cut...) and he raved about it. We shared mashed potatoes and asparagus and they were excellent. Plus, they threw in a free desert for my boyfriend's b-day. He chose the banana cream pie number, it was awesome. Honestly, the atmosphere (dark wood, dimmed lights, totally romantic), the food (OMG!) and the service (attentive but not obnoxious, genuinely nice, warm, funny) were all topnotch. I will definitely make this a regular stop when I am in Chicago. It is "pricey" but oh so worth it. Delicious, wonderful dining experience!P.S. Do. NOT. touch. the. plates. No finger prints for days. Wasn't fun.
