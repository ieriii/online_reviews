We went for the first time on Mother's Day and it was amazing! The decor, the food and the service were all top notch. My husband had the Thai Omlete. It was filled with shrimp and pork and so fluffy and light. I had the shrimp with egg sauce, poached egg, avocado on rice patties. OMG doesn't even explain the textures and flavors working together. The egg was so creamy once my fork opened it up. It then merged with all the others and my taste buds went crazy! We finished off with the "A Tale of Two Tuna" rolls. Heaven on a plate. White (Escolar) Tuna with ahi tuna. WOW! Our server was Allison G. She was so gracious and attentive. Lastly, the Bloody Mary bar was insane. Everything under the kitchen sink and the freshest of fresh ingredients (as is everything). It's no wonder that Sunda is so loved!
