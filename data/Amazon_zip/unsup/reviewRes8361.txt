This pizza is awesome. It's pricey, and the wait can be long, but it's definitely worth it. Tucked into a small corner of Ravenwood and Sunnyside, Spacca Napoli serves amazingly simple (in a good way) thin crust authentic Italian pizza. I always swear to get something other than the Bufalina pizza, but with its delicate pieces of buffalo mozarrella that melt in your mouth mixed with the fresh basil -- I can't say no.  SN has a decent wine list, and the wine is served in authentic Italian wine glasses (I don't know what they're called -- the kind with no stems). Even though the individual pizza sizes are generous, I am too much of a glutton to leave any for take home. Last time I went I tried the chocolate and banana gelatos for dessert (separate) and they were heavenly.  The only reason SN received four stars instead of five is price and the wait. Granted, I'm cheap, but it's hard to throw down $15 for an individual pizza too frequently. This, however, is my problem. Also note that if you go on key times -- especially Friday/Saturday nights -- you're going to wait. I try to go on a Tuesday right after work, or later on a Saturday afternoon. If you're on the fence, try out Spacca Napoli.
