My most visited Middle Eastern restaurant. Excellent prices for lots of food. As a vegetarian, I love that they mark what's vegetarian and vegan on the menu. It's also good watching them make it in front of you, since you know what you are really getting, and not worry (at least not as much as you would in other restaurants) about meat and non-meat coming into contact. I've done both take out and dine in. The restaurant is really large, so I've never had a problem getting a seat. The choice of music can be interesting- one time I ate to the best of the Geto Boys. If you need lunch and you're taking the Damen bus, and it's at least a 15 minute wait (and isn't it always for Damen?), then this is perfect to run in for takeout. They're quick to prepare the food, so it's like Middle Eastern fast food (and I mean that in a good way!) The falafel sandwiches and lentil soup are very good; I do prefer the hummus at Babylon though. But overall, this restaurant is always going to be a mainstay on my list.
