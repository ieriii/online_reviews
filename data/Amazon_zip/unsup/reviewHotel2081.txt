The Holiday Inn Mart Plaza is stashed in the upper floors of the Apparel Center, west of the Merchandise Mart. It is a decent hotel, and most of its clientele comes for the trade shows at the Mart. Check in on the 15th floor, and the rooms all are centralized around a courtyard over the lobby. The rooms are standard, with the corner rooms getting some more space. There are no "low floor" rooms here. The indoor pool can be very crowded, usually with kids.
