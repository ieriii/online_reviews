This place has great food but watch out they will trick you on your bill in every which way. Oh thy hate Groupons! One day they told me they wont accept Groupon unless we pay with one card. Ya there was 12 people in our party. Another time server said Groupon is for cash paying customers only. Today my wife tried making reservations & they are all booked but they will grant us the use of our Groupon on take out but will charge us extra 18% gratuity. 18% GRATUITY ON A TAKE OUT???? I'm staring to hate this place!
