I love this place. As far as rooftop bars go, this is one of the best I've experienced. If you go on the right night, you shouldn't have trouble getting a table. I can't speak much for the food because I mainly came here for drinks, but I did have a cheese flight and a few appetizers and they served their purpose, which was to coat my stomach with substance to alleviate my subsequent substance abuse. :P It's a little pricey and it's sort of a yuppy-ish crowd, but it's great place to hang out with friends or pregame for the nearby clubs. I also think it's a great place to take a date and talk over drinks. It's scenic and beautiful, so if that's what you're looking for, Zed451 is the right place.
