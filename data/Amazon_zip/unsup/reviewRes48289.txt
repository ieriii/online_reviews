I am so looking forward to coming back here as soon as possible! We decided on the Publican for a 'second dinner' last weekend...when we told this to our waiter he asked if we were hobbits. This place is gorgeous...awesome interior design, beautiful lighting, and a great menu. Many of the tables are communal, like in a beer hall which can be either really fun or really annoying if you're seated next to idiots who think it's okay to slam their fists on the table every 30 seconds while yapping way too loudly about their awesomeness. Anyhow, it's quite lovely inside. I had never really been to a gastropub before this, so wasn't totally sure what to expect. It's slightly daunting in that sense, but it's also exciting for those who like to try new things. We decided on the mussels and fries which were suuuper good. I'm not sure what all these complaints are about the fries not being exquisite creations from heaven....they're french fries...either they suck or they don't. These ones happen to not suck. They are actually quite good. The mussels, our waiter explained, are made with a lambic base rather than a white wine base, which is what mussels are always cooked with. I had never had mussels before, and our waiter lamented that it's generally downhill from the Publican's. I believe him. They were delicious. The beer list was great, and we were able to pick fun new things to try. The only negative thing I have to say about this place is that the bussers were a little over-eager. My boyfriend had a piece of bread halfway into his mouth when a busser whisked the remainder of the loaf from his plate and hurried away. Not so much with that.... But this place is great! So excited to return and try some more new things!
