Have I shared my love for Ethiopian? If not, it is WAY past time. I could eat this grub daily. Little did I know when I bought my home that I was settling into the best place in the city to indulge this passion to the fullest. Why could I eat it daily? HRM, well, first off, the sambusas are amazing. Especially at Demera. They have a combo platter of these. Get it. Really. TRY THEM ALL! This is a communal type food so come hungry, suck it up butter cup and EAT!! Demera has chicken, SPICY ASSED BEEF, Tuna- which I have never tried anywhere else but LURVE, spinach (YUM) and a Lentil.  Last time we were here we had some veggies who we segregated to one end of the table and some meat eaters who congregated at the rest of the table. We had a BOATLOAD of food. It made me feel guilty, greedy, and damn happy. We ordered the chefs plate for 6. We had everything you could ever want, including a Tilapia dish. To be honest, my favorite is almost always the spinach or the collard greens. I like the meat as a change of pace and the salad as a palate cleanser. Demera was a winner. On all accounts. Food was fantastic. Service was stellar. Price was just right!
