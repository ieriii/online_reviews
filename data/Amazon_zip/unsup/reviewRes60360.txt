This isn't everybody's thing. A lot of people who have never had stuffed pizza before and try it for the first time are disappointed. I think that people need to stop thinking of this as pizza -- it's something entirely different, but soooo good. I've been eating Giordano's since I moved to Chicago as a kid. Now I'm away at college and can't find good stuffed pizza anywhere, let alone people who actually know what stuffed pizza is :(In any case, Giordano's is the best stuffed pizza in the city. Hands down.
