I really wanted to like this place....I've heard great things from people who live in the neighborhood and saw the bit on DDD, but this place is overpriced and bland. I'm giving the 2 stars b/c we ordered some mussels for an appetizer, and they were not bad. They were cooked well and not gritty, however the sauce they were prepared in had absolutely NO flavor....not much point in sopping up the cooking liquid with texas toast, because there was no flavor. For entrees, we ordered a tuna melt and hot crab dip. The tuna melt looked good, but was really wet and drippy and soon became a soggy mess. The crab dip ($10.95!!) was bland and had so much mayo in it, i felt my chest tightening and I didn't see a shred of crab. There was, however, a lot of lightly cooked onions, which i could do without.  Their pies are from Hoosier Mama, which never fails to delight.  The service was nice and friendly, however, they never refilled our drinks.  Verdict: Maybe we ordered wrong...they're open until 10pm, so swing by for a late nite pie fix.
