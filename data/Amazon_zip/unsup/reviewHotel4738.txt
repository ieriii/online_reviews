Chicago was magnificent city could have been more enjoyable if i had not stayed at the hotel felix for a couple nightts .. rooms where the size of a tv box and got charged through the roof for them me and my gf stopped by the dana hotel and spa and asked what there rates were and it was 75$ cheaper sooo since we only booked there for a couple days we stayed got nasty room service from the elate restaurant stayed up all night because of the paper thin walls and loud elevator and then went on over to the dana and made up for it
