Really good, authentic Spanish food seems almost impossible to come by in the US (or at least Chicago). Mercat does only one of those adjectives well, but its the one that counts. Yes, neither my months of traveling around Spain nor my Spanish gf had ever heard of fideua or paella served as a tapa, but there they are at Mercat: tiny, but beautiful and delicious. I've been here twice and everything I've ever gotten or tried has been delicious. People talk about the sangria, but honestly I think the food is the highlight (maybe I just prefer no brandy in my sangria). So many options to choose from and flavors to combine. Anything with seafood in it is divine. Their saucier is amazing. Ingredients are consistently top-notch and prepared perfectly. Things I particularly enjoyed (again, everything was delicious) were the chipirones a la plancha (tough to find chipirones around), gambas al ajillo, and of course the fideua negra. But there is so much that I have not yet had and want to try on my next visit. For two people, expect to pay around $100 for a generous meal, pitcher of sangria, tax and tip. A bit pricey, but totally worth it culinarily. Not to mention the fact that the decor and style definitely set the perfect tone for a special occasion.
