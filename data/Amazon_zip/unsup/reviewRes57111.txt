I dined in the lounge area because there was a wait for the dinning area. It was extremely loud. The service was average. Not bad, but not good. But the major disappointment was the food!We had the guacamole & yuca for appetizers. blahI had the pollo billy for an entree. It was extremely bland! No flavor what-so-ever! I substituted the french fries for beans and rice. The worst beans and rice I have had in a long time. They too were bland and reminded me of something pre-made and out of a box.My bf had the arranchera (skirt steak), he said it was okay but nothing to write home about. Plus the portion was extremely small considering the price. Overall, very overrated and over priced! So many more latin restaurants in the city with better, more authentic food at way better prices! Would NOT recommend nor will I be back.
