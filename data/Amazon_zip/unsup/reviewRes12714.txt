And then there were 7....men. All you can eat meat? It's a guy thing. I'm tempted to stop right there, but that just wouldn't be very useful now would it? Texas de Brazil is a churrascaria; a Brazilian-style steakhouse. I've been to a few in my lifetime. The experience is very guy-friendly. For a fixed price, you get to eat as much meat as you want. It's pure carnage. You basically have a round disc or "puck" with a red or green side. Green signals "Feed me!!!!" Red signals "I'm full." Let the games begin. The discs were green side up and within seconds a flock of waiters carrying various skewered hunks of charbroiled meat emerged. "Bacon-wrapped Filet Mignon?" "Garlic Chicken?" "House-Special Beef?" "Flank steak?" "Roast Rib?" "Spanish style Sausage?" "Roast Pork?" "Grilled Top SIrloin?" "Barbequed Ribs?" "Spit-roasted Leg of Lamb?" "Lamb Chops?" We might as well have been sitting on thrones with sceptres in our hand. I've never had to work so little to eat so much meat in my entire life. And the rest of the world wonders why Americans are obese? I think I can only partake in such gluttony once every 5 years. 7 men. No women. Tons of beef. Drinks. The discussion was riddled with the "B-word" and sports. What else were you expecting? Go to Texas de Brazil if you need to rediscover your manhood. Quick notes: Sushi Bar Salad Bar Highlights: Prosciutto Manchego Cheese Cornichons Reggiano $85 a head with tax, tip, and 2 drinks. Overall, the meat is good quality (Prime Beef) and is very well seasoned with plain salt which brings out the natural flavor. Honestly, you have to love and crave meat for this to be an enoyable experience.
