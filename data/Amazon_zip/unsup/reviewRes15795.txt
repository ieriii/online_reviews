I liked this very, very much. Great upscale latin food in a fun, colorful environment. There was a live Mariachi band when I entered. I tried some creative cocktails: a "Jalisco Fizz", and a great Margarita. To start, an arepa with tender, delicious, slightly crispy pork. Bistek Palomilla (rib eye, with mushrooms and yucca) was beautiful, succulent, juicy and delicious. Costilla de Res (short rib) didn't need a knife. The space is huge, and was packed, but service wasn't rushed.
