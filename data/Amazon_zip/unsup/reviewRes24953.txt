MMMMM....bacon. After eating at Mercat, you can see why Jose Garces is an Iron Chef. We had the chef's tasting menu, and everything was wonderful. There was not a single dish that I did not enjoy. The wine pairing was excellent as well. Service was good, and the ambiance was nice as well. Mercat is one of the top dining experiences I have had, and anyone in Chicago or visiting must do.
