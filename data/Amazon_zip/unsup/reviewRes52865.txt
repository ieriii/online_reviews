Since coming back from Miami in June, I have been out to find really amazing Cuban food in the city. When searching on Yelp for a great nearby restaurant, 90 Miles came up so we ventured down Milwaukee and west on Armitage to see what it was all about. When we arrived, the place looked very small, however our host brought us to their huge patio out back. It was like being transported into a little Miami walk-up. The decor is absolutely adorable and the atmosphere is so festive. This would be a great place to celebrate a birthday or other event. Just wish i would've realized sooner that it was BYOB! As for the food, I had the bistec with chimmichuri and the hubster had the porkchops. The maduros were amazing--perfect in every way--as was the white rice. My steak was a little tough. I wish they would've marinated the skirt steak a little longer to make it more tender. However, for the price of 12.95 i think it was still very good. My husband thought his chuletas were a little dry, but i remember them always being a tad dry when my dad would make them at home. We finished the night off with coconut flan and were very pleased. Everything--from the decor to the food--was incredibly authentic and we really enjoyed ourselves. Can't wait to come back for the ropa vieja that everyone is raving about.
