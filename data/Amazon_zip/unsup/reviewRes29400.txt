Pasta Bowl is an exceptional little pasta place near clark and fullerton that serves a wide variety of tasty pasta dishes. Good atmosphere right when you walk into the building as you can view cooks preparing sauces in frying pans and the smell of freshly prepared dishes smacks you right in the nose. I've eaten here many times but my favorites are the rigatoni bolognese and the fruit da mare. R.B. has a really hearty meat sauce with a good amount of mushrooms that I really enjoyed. Great place to take a girl on a casual date or to take friends visiting from out of town. The only reason why I didn't give it a 5 is because they don't have a dessert menu per se, it's just frozen cheese cake or cannoli that they unwrap from a package.. Still recommend highly though!
