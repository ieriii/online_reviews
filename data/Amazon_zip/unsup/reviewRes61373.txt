My husband and I always pass by this restaurant in our area and it always smells so good outside of it so we decided to go on a date and go there for our first time...90 miles Cuban has phenomenal food! The waitress are great, the feel of the restaurant is welcoming, great location, you don't have to wait for long to be seated, there food portions are big and they even have BYOB. I love this place I truly do recommend everyone to try it....My hubby & I had Ropa Vieja (Shredded beef) with white rice, black beans & sweet plantains and it was Delicious! ...Don't take my word for it try it. =)
