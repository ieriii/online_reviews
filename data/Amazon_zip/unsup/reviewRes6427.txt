Wildfire is one of my favorite reasturants. They have a great selection of seafood and meat. I love there steak, it has a great flavor and is cooked to perfection every time. I have a sweet tooth so that is why my favorite part of this experience is the chocolate cookie with nuts and ice cream. The best ive had in a long time! I recomend this place to any one who is looking for a great meal!
