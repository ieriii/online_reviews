Partner and I stayed for the night after seeing it on Today Show. We spent one night in the Inn, last night. The rooms are small, but well outfitted,(no down pillows :( ). It is tight, and the bathroom toilet shower combo is a hassle as everything is wet, its like being on a cruise ship. We had lunch in the restaurant when we arrived, yes I had the Pork Belly Cuban sandwich and duck fat fries. It was good, would I give it 5 stars, no!! Had a Bloody Mary as well and just like Milwaukee they serve it with a sidecar of beer. Partner had the burger and said it was great. The fries were not that amazing as people say they are, I like the comment that compared them to Wendys Sea Salt fries, thought it was spot on. We spent the day out and about in Chicago, came back around 8 to get ready to go out to dinner. Stopped in the bar for a drink. Great crowd, tables all full, managed to get 2 seats at the bar. 2 guys and a girl tending bar. The guys were great, they know their Wiskey and offered up suggestions, but the girl killed it. She was just rude and had no personality. She needs to be moved to the back of the house. I would probably given it 4 stars, but she blew it for L&E. If you get to Chicago, you need to go here, stay here, its on the BLue Line, free parking on the street all weekend and the rooms are cool for $110 bucks a night.
