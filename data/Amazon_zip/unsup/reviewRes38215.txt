I will be one of the few negative reviews of the Hopleaf. I've been going to this place for years. I live in Andersonville and love it. I have tolerated the hipsters at Hopleaf for years because I love the beer selection. BUT recently, we met some friends here to have dinner. I know they don't take reservations, we were fine with waiting for an hour for a table (there was a large group occupying several tables). Two hours later, we were finally seated, sitting above the kitchen, we could only smell french fries. Despite the comped fries for our long wait, the food was just not as good as it used to be. And it took another 1/2 to catch a waitress to take our order. I think the 'Leaf is a victim of its own success, I will not seek it out in future.
