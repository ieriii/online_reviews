i heart hot dougs. thank goodness i don't live any closer to this place cause those tasty sausages would lure me in like a sirens' song and i would probably weigh a bajillion pounds. i'll pretty much echo what everyone else has said. check the menu online before you go so you know what you're getting in to. expect to wait about an hour, mostly outside (don't worry, sooooo worth it). try the duck fat fries if you get a chance and definitely get a couple different dogs. most of them are reeeediculously good, a few of them are kind of weird but still tasty and some of them add character. don't be afraid to try the game of the week. kangaroo, antelope, elk, etc. all taste pretty damn good in sausage form.
