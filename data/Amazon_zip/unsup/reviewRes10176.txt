Our server said I was the first to try the halibut. Well, it was fantastic. The fish was the perfect texture and I love leeks and mushrooms - so it was heaven. It was brilliant over the bed of Farro.  Bread was great too - and look for the little genie bottle on the table with the perfectly balanced balsamic.  Service - service was on point - everything taken care of without being obtrusive, our server was knowledgeable about the menu and wine pairings/substitutions and was very pleasant to be around. Atmosphere - contemporary without trying too hard. The music was a little distracting in that it didn't match the vibe of the place. If that is the worst thing I can say, they aren't missing much. Prices - On the higher side, but proportionate to the quality I thought. They have a wood fired oven, so I will definitely be back to try some things that come out of there! Well done Piccolo Sogno - you managed to breathe new life into a location that had lost it's identity. Can't wait to experience this place again. 4.5 stars.
