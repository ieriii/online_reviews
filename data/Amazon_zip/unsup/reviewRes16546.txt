For my money, if you're looking for quality and car wioth your booze from bartenders / mixologists who give a crap about what they make, Violet Hour is hard to beat. Yep, its darka nd quiet. It may not fulfill your every need in a bar on every night. But if you want to meet up with some good friends, have a great drink (from a list that rotates seasonally), and not be worried about being molested with a crowded bar, this is worth a look. That being said, the velvet rope treatment is a little out of place for the quality within (we're not at Crobar or Transit, are we?). It matches their speakeasy concept, I get it, but still gives you that 'meh' feeling. With a little planning, you can get around this. Talk to your bartender, make a friend, and ask about when they are/are not busy. You may not have the freedom to roll in at 1AM, with no wait, but that's really not the point of this place (that's Tavern around the corner, right?). They never allow more people in then they have seats to sit their butts, so waiting in line actually results in some sort of benefit. Did I also mention the drinks?
