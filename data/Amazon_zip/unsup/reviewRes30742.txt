A collegue and I went to Mastros (for the first time) for a business outing a few days ago and had a wonderful time!! The food was great- especially the butter cake!! Our server Amber was very outgoing, knowledgable and good at what she does!! We will return soon and ask for Amber!! Thank you! Eric
