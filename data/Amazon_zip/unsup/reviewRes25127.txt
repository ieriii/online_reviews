Went here last visit in Chicago and it was a flawless experience. I think we had the best seat in the house (second floor, right next to the glass over looking the entire restaurant). Some of the dishes we ordered included the bacon wrapped dates which were deadly, the garlic shrimp (wouldn't order that again... boring), the short ribs and scallops (AWEsome), cider pork belly (I mean, it's pork belly sooo of course it was amazing), and the rabbit pasta. We ordered a good amount more but we went to pop's for champagne and NoMi before for drinks so my memory isn't the best... not to mention we had a thing of sangria at Mercat. They also gave some delicious tomato bread while waiting. I would definitely come here again... next time without drinking so much before hand. LOVE IT!
