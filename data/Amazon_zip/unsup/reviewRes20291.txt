I've only gotten delivery from Coast. Never had the pleasure of having the pretentious dining experience. The sushi is good, but not the best I've had. The prices don't seem high, until you get your food and realize the maki rolls are less than half the size of ones you get at other sushi restaurants. The delivery is very fast though so that counts for something. I think Sushi X has better food and the prices fit the portions so I'll stick to ordering delivery from there.
