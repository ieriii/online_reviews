What kind of restaurant asks you "what can I do for you?" when you approach the host? I'm here to eat, isn't that obvious!?! Food can be better than average but is overpriced and portions are way small. Annoyingly over-enthusiastic waitress. They seemed more concerned with their green theme and selling craft beer than with food and service.
