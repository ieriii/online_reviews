Love Irazu! BYOB and CASH ONLY! Delivery, carry out, eat in (enclosed veranda seating is available) Henry, Omar and Justin the First are terrific and inspire the entire staff to terrific teamwork and attentive customer service. Street parking is usually available. We like the veggie tacos, Gallo Pinto spicy (mixed black beans and rice with grilled jalapeos), the cabbage and beet salad, and the oatmeal shakes made with water! The berry shake, pineapple, and tamarind shakes are also terrific. The husband also likes the chicken sandwich. I highly recommend Irazu!
