Don't be duped by "date night". Maybe, I am just too picky, but the two options for each course were not very tempting. To be honest I don't eat salmon and I'm not wowed by tofu. Those items were featured in the two main course selections for the "date night" menu. So now, our $50 date night will be $100 date night. That's a doozie. The food was really tasty, but did it warrant the flashy prices? I'll answer that. No. I've had very similar dishes for at least a third of the price. I guess the location and decor cost a bit to maintain. The service was stuffy and a bit pretentious. The tables stacked right on top of each other, but I am sensing that's a theme here in Chicago.
