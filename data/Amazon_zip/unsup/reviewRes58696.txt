The food at this restaurant is pretty good. unfortunately, this fact is tempered by a waitstaff and management who treats their customers like they are too cool to do their job. I have had several bad expereinces there, finally adding up to more than just coincidence I have been several times, and everytime I'm met with incompetency and arrogance - a bad combination. Once, my reservation was lost on arrival, even after I had called to confirm it. And instead of trying to fix it, the hostesses tried to convince me that it must have been my fault in some way. Another time I ordered a drink in the downstairs bar, but the bartender didn't feel like getting one of the missing ingredients from the upstairs bar, so he told me to order something else. This was followed by a dining experience where the waiter introduced himself by saying, so, do you know what you want yet? Not worth the money...go to some of the other good tapas in Chicago...they are aplenty.
