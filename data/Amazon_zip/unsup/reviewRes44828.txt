I love that Giordano's is open so late but the service was pretty slow. I also don't get why we had to wait 20+ minutes to be seated when the place is huge and there were plenty of open tables. On to the food.. I'm still debating whether it was a mistake to get that artichoke dip because although it was totally mediocre and left me with less room for that MASSIVE deep dish pizza, it took sooo long to get the food that I absolutely needed something to munch on. Anyway, the pizza actually did have really good quality ingredients but there was SO much cheese. I love deep dish pizza but omg I'm talking several inches of cheese. I literally could have had a heart attack on the spot at this place. The crust was delicious though. Honestly I wanted to throw up after eating there but now I'm craving the madness all over again. Anyway, this is a good place to go if you're feeling absolutely gluttonous and are prepared for a potential upset stomach later on in the night (unless you've actually developed tolerance for eating several pounds of cheese at a time). Just prepare to wait a long time for the pizza to cook and, if you can stand the wait, don't waste your money on any appetizers.
