Went here for dinner before a Blackhawks game, and it seems to be a popular gathering spot for those fans. I was very happy with the service; the waiter was so friendly and worked really hard. Wish I could remember his name but it was something long and Greek.  I ordered the Keftedes with rice and potatoes which were really good, and a pretty safe choice for anyone venturing into the world of Greek food. Of course, no Greek meal would be complete without an order of Saganaki, the highlight of which was watching it be set on fire. We ordered wine and I dont think they serve beer but not sure. Cute and cozy restaurant, especially the fireplace.
