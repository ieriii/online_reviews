Sorry SuperDawg but you don't compare to other great Chicago hot dog joints. This place is seriously overrated. Yes, the dogs on the top of the building are cool and it is an "old school" establishment but their food is nothing special.  They are WAY over priced for what you get, especially their milk shakes, what a joke ($5 for a tiny cup of nothing!?!?).  My suggestion: Head down to Jim's on Maxwell, Hot Doug's, Vienna Beef Factory or even Costco's food court to get a better hot dog and save your gas and the environment (does everything have to come in a box?).
