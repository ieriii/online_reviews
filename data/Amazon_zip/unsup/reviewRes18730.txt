This place is truly a hidden gem. From outside looking in it seems to be a jungle of houseplants, but the crowds on Friday nights should tip you off to the deliciousness of the cuisine inside. I once had a seafood pasta dish with a pesto sauce which was a "special" for the day. It was the best Italian food I have ever had. When we returned a few months later, it was (understandably) not on the menu, but when I requested it they made it for me anyway! In my opinion, Italian food doesn't get better than this - except maybe in Italy itself.
