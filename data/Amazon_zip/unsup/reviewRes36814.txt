Food was good, but I've had better. There are a couple places here in San Diego that I think have better breakfast/brunch than Meli. The service, however, was phenomenal.  We were seated at the table right next to the hostess, and people started to wait right next to us because this place gets crowded. The hostess was kind enough to ask the waiting customers to move because we were eating. Very attentive and thoughtful. I'd absolutely recommend this restaurant.
