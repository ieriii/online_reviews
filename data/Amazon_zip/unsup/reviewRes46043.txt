Call me strange, but aside from its grand size, am I the one who thinks the Cheesecake Factory is BETTER than Grand Lux? I've eaten at both at least 3 dozen times apiece and I've never once been disappointed with a CF dish. As for Grand Lux, many, many disappointments...even when I ordered the same dishes served at the CF.  Cheesecake Factory just seems to have a more "alive" atmosphere, dishes that are served quicker AND warmer, cheesecakes are served colder, and just outstanding service overall.  Grand Lux has a great view, $10 valet parking, and ...umh....and quite an expansive menu (although most menu items are subpar in taste when compared to most any other restaurants in town. Both the taste and presentation of the Grand Lux are reminiscent of "Chain" or "franchised" food service. Anywho, I'll give Grand Lux 3 out of 5 stars based on everything BUT the food (cheap valet parking, view, decor). If I factored in the food, the rating would be lowered to 2 out of 5 stars simply because there are so many better restaurants offering true fine dining...starting with their very own Cheesecake Factory.
