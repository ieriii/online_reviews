What a great surprise. Who would think you could get pork-oriented tapas more or less above the Billy Goat Tavern? We enjoyed the pork shoulder, but the show stopper was something that just sounded weird but not so weird that we weren't intrigued. The fried deviled egg (only one) was so yummy, it took us by complete surprise. Shaped like a breaded Easter egg, it looked like an intact egg but in fact had the deviled yolk inside. We sort of wanted bread, and without charge they brought out a freshly toasted crostini made to order! If you're not into sharing your food, walk past this oddly named place. But if you enjoy good wine and fresh takes on pork and cheese tapas, take it from this tourist, Purple Pig was a sure winner. Tha-tha-that's all folks!
