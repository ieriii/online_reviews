So much hype for Hot Doug's, especially since it has now been featured on both the Travel Channel and Food Network. I have to say that it more than lived up to my expectations! We decided to brave it this past Saturday so we could take advantage of the duck fat fries (only available Fri and Sat). After waiting in line for over 2 hours (hence the deduction of one star because, seriously? 2 hours?), we stepped up to the plate and ordered the following: - Chicago Dog - Thuringer Dog - Atomic Dog - Foie Gras Sausage - Bacon & Jalapeno Duck Yep. The two of us polished off 5 dogs/sausages plus an order of duck fat fries. Gotta say, I would almost wait 2 hours for those fries alone! I would definitely recommend ordering whatever spicy specialty they have as the Atomic and Bacon/Jalapeno were our favorites.
