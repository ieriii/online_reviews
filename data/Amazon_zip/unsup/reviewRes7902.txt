I went here on a blind date last night, and it was a good choice. It has a nice casual feeling, but also a touch of class. Not too crazy about the wine selection, but the menu focuses on specific cuisine and a specific way of preparing it. In that regard, I guess I expected a little more finesse. The pizza was the best part, in traditional style of the Napoli region, which is simple, yet quality (which I really enjoy). The pizza was also the most affordable part of the meal, while our pancetta salad was VERY bacony and the prosciutto and buffalo cheese was simple, but way too much for two people and at 15 dollars should have been a little more dressed up. Overall, good, not too many bells and whistles, affordable, but I would like to go back to try again and maybe figure out the menu a little bit better to order a better, more well rounded and adventurous meal. Its clean, simple Italian pizza at a acceptable price.
