Few places come close to having the kind of pizza I've had in Italy, but Piece comes pretty close with their fresh ingredients and tasty thin crust. Another fabulous visit to Piece on a Saturday night--what were we thinking? We were quoted an hour and a half but it ended up only being 45 minutes. We decided to let our boys join us on this girls night out--after all, what's beer and pizza without the boys? What I really like about Piece is its atmosphere--warm and casual. The prices are extremely affordable and service is usually good. Our server was great--when the kitchen made a mistake with our toppings, she had them make another one (as is their policy) while we snacked on the first pizza. We didn't mind, more pizza for everyone! Love the Don De Dieu, one of the best beers I've had. Chocolate cake is not as good as the ice cream sundae but still pretty good. I didn't even mind the bad singing from karaoke night.
