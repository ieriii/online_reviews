The first thing I wanted to try when I got off the plane was a Chicago-style deep dish pizza. So many Chicago deep dish pizza places to choose from so we decided to give this place a try. It was crowded and so you can order your pizza before you even get a table so you don't have to wait that long when you do get one. We were hella hungry so for appetizer we ordered the "Family Appetizer Platter" which was humongous! It had breaded calamari, chicken wings, breaded mushrooms, zucchini sticks, breaded shrimp, mozzarella sticks, and tender chicken fingers. I enjoyed everything here besides the chicken fingers. It tasted like the ones you get from the freezer section of your grocery store. Then we ordered the pizza which they called it stuffed pizza here. Got the special which consisted of sausage, mushrooms, green peppers, and onions. The pizza was good but it was hard to eat and just fell apart on my plate. Didn't really feel like I was eating a pizza. I guess I prefer the regular hand tossed or thin crust style pizzas. =/
