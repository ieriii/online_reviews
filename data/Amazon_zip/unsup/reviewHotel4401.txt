My friend and I spent the night at the Palmer House for New Years Eve. The room was nice and clean. I absolutely love the old time feel of this hotel. The staff was friendly. It was great that they had hired extra security to keep out anyone who wasn't a registered guest from heading up to the room. I was expecting a ruckus night of morons running up and down the hall. But it turned into a peaceful, alcoholic night of sleep. It was a great place to crash after a night of horking down free shrimp and downing a couple pitchers of pink lemonade at one of the Chicago bars. One thought kept haunting me though: I really hoped they changed the linens (or burned the beds) after IML.
