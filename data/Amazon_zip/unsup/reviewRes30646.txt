AMAZING! We went on a Monday night at 9 pm and it was packed! Great atmosphere and even better sushi. Everything we ordered was amazing. Both mine and my friend's cocktail was so good and I usually don't drink during dinner. For food, two of us shared the crab wrapped with salmon, the blue crab roll, "tale of two tunas" roll, and escolar (my favorite!). The menu is huge and they had many cooked dishes also. Wish I lived there so I could go back!
