Oh Lao Sze Chuan. You were once my favorite spot in Chinatown. But I will never come back. I came here with my family and we were shoved in the back room upstairs, which was filled with cigar smoke, presumably from the diamond-studded manager. Said manager was fond of yelling at the top of his cigar-smoke filled lungs. Our waitress left 5 min after arriving for her shift--maybe he yelled at her too. Now that I've set the stage, let us discuss the food. First, there was hair in the spicy cabbage. A dark, real human hair. Gagging ensued. Next, we were not provided with soup bowls or spoons. Said soup was bland and cold. We were brought spring rolls with no sauce. And there were still veins in the shrimp--an absolute sanitary no-no. The rest of the food was just average. Service was terrible. As I mentioned, our waitress left right after starting her shift. So the other waiters came over every so often as time permitted. The timing of the food was poor; most of the time we were waiting around and then we were slammed with food. And even after we received the food, we were always waiting around for something else. Very annoying. The final straw was having a family member trip over a bus pan that was left in the hallway on the floor. They've been in business way too long to be such a disaster. What the heck happened to this place?
