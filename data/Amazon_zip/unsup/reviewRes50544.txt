Definitely try this place for brunch, which is offered both Saturdays & Sundays. The complimentary beignets are so soft and melt in your mouth. Also, order the fried green tomatoes! It's a great dish to share -- comes with 4 fried tomatoes (and shrimp!).. it's a really filling starter. I also tried the gumbo, which I thought was pretty good as well (but the fried green tomatoes were better!). For my entree, I got the shrimp and grits -- amazing. My friend got the Eggs New Orleans, and she said that she had never had crab cakes that good. I definitely need to return so I can try those out. Try the sweet tea as well! They have a number of different flavors. I think I tried the peach and my friend had the passionfruit, and both were very refreshing. The tea comes in one glass pitcher, while the sweet syrup comes in a small beaker, so you can adjust the sweetness of your drink to your liking. They have unlimited refills, which is always nice. Also, I had an alacard thing for $10 off $25 and also a coupon from a Yelp event for the same deal -- the waitress let me use one & my friend use the other! She was really attentive throughout the entire meal as well. We had a lot of leftover food (which happens when you order $50 worth between 2 people, I guess...) and they split up our food into boxes equally, so that we wouldn't have to do that at a later time -- really thoughtful of them. Ahh, I really want to return soon...
