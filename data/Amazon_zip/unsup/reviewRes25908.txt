Pretty average fare. I, too, was excited at the prospects of a multiple course lunch special but in all honesty, it was pretty lackluster. Soup was msg-ladened clear broth. Salad was a small plate of regular greens with some syrupy. The offerings of a free beverage was also a nice touch. I chose the shrimp + veggies as my entree and it was pretty standard stir fry with the typical Asian vegetables (think bok choy, mini corn, a couple string beans here and there). Nice touch of cut fruit at the end. The meal was indeed light, didn't feel greasy afterwards. Rather, I felt somewhat unsatisfied and wanting for more (but didn't know what after. Friendly and prompt service. Would I be back again? Only if to try their pho and I don't want to head to Argyle.
