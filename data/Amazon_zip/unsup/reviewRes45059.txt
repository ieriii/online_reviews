I wanted to like this place but it just underperformed. Service was unapologetically slow (they weren't packed on a Sun night). Fish came out too salty and the table was finished eating before our waiter was back to check. With that said there were some good dishes: burrata deserved a double order, the amatriciana with guanciale could not have been better, pork shoulder was solid. I wouldn't try to go back here, but it's quaint and not all bad if you're in the 'hood.
