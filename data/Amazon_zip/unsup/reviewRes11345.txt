Bongo Room is THE best brunch place in Chicago, bar none! I went for brunch this past Sunday and had to wait 40 minutes, which for this place isn't bad. Luckily, the Wicker Park Festival provided a ready distraction. Once seated, the service was quick and friendly. Despite the many people waiting outside, we were never made to feel rushed, which made me love them even more. I mean, everyone waits forever so you should be allowed to enjoy the culinary experience once you're seated. I had the spinach, feta and red pepper eggs benedict or as it should be called - heaven. I have been here before and always tried their sweet breakfasts, which are to die for but I was craving protein and gave this dish a try. It was fantastic! I mentioned to the waitress that I was pondering the Chocolate Tower French Toast but leaning more towards the Eggs Benedict and she said that many people didn't know that you could ask for just one slice of the Chocolate French Toast, which I promptly did. Delicious! Warning: I've had the Chocolate Tower French Toast dish before and it really is a massive tower (has serious height and width). You would need to run like 20 miles to justify eating this dish, seriously. So, unless you're a linebacker, I would suggest ordering just one slice or a half order or whatever smaller portion of this dish they'll allow - or share it. If you plan to eat it by yourself, it's so big that you'll almost feel embarrassed to have it in front of you. I did. People actually asked to take pictures of it before I destroyed it.
