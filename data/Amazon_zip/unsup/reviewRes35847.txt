My wife and I went to Sun Wah last night for dinner. We got the Beijing Duck Dinner. Everything we were served was really great. The roast duck was so perfectly cooked (probably the best duck I have ever tasted). The soup and fried rice were both great as well.  I thought the service was very good. Our server was quick, nice and very knowledgeable. The dinner was $30 and we have leftovers for 2 more meals. I think it is one of the best values in Chicago.
