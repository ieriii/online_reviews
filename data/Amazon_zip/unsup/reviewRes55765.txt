OK - This was for delivery - I have never been to the restaurant - so maybe a great martini would make it 2 stars. I thought the food was pretty bad. The ribs were dry, cold and nothing to shout about. We only ate 1/2 and the rest were tossed. Chicken Marsala - awful - chicken breasts in some broth, no flavor. Pizza - it was ok - again - nothing great. I am used to good food and eat out quite often. I used to order delivery a lot until I moved far north - I can't find any great restaurants with delivery up here! And the guy that delivered it gave us attitude because he had to come up the stairs. Hey! that's why I'm paying a delivery fee and tipping you - to bring it to my door!!I definitely won't order delivery from here again.
