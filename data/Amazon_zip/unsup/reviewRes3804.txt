went for lunch today. the seating is large, fancier, "picnic tables", complete with paper towel rolls at the table. very clean, laid back, friendly service. i was a little nervous and hesitant at first, as I have never tried Korean food! It was DE-LISH! My brother and I both had the Buddah Bowl- which is a mix of veggies, white rice- and we added grilled chicken. very filling(my brother added hot sauce, i did not). huge portions. we also ordered the fried mushrooms, which were nothing exciting, but still tasty. :)
