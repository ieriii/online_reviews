I have been here several times for lunch. I can honestly say that this establishment has it together. The food is quite good. I have had, The Regular Burger, The Gage Burger, and the Salmon (which is a frequent daily special). All dishes were prepared really well. Even the fries are delicious. It may take a little while to get your food (especially if its crowded). Don't freak out though. I only have an hour for lunch and I always make good time. The only "problem" that I have with this place is the noise level. But what are you gonna do right? However, if you think you're going to escape the noise by eating in the little patio area out front, you're wrong. ESPECIALLY during the summer. Not only are there nonstop buses coming by, but there are a ton of people walking past (its tourist season after all). If you're into that, by all means sit there. Otherwise, do yourself a favor and grab a table inside. This place isn't over the top "oh my gosh I have to eat here everyday". But if you want good service, in a clean but not too stuffy environment, and typical American food (less a ton of grease), I highly recommend The Gage. P.S.-If you decide to go here during the week for happy hour, expect a crowd.
