I am a little uneasy about writing this review. My experiences at Hopleaf has been mixed. Let me explain. The first time I went to Hopleaf was a year ago or more. It was packed. By the grace of God or Luck we got two seats at the bar as a couple was leaving. We quickly sat down and embraced the aray of beers on tap. My friend and I had a great time testing different beers. The bartender was well knowledgable! Great because there was tons of beers we didnt recognize. We ordered an appetizer to balance our "trying." After a couple hours we left happy. Here is where the review gets uneasy. After that great experience, I have attempted to go back to Hopleaf three times. Once at 9pm on a Friday(big mistake) it was packed, Again we tried at 7pm on a Thursday again packed. And then finally we went at 630pm on a Sunday, you guessed PACKED! Is there any a time this place isnt packed!   Couldnt vote too negatively on this place cause i did enjoy but I would really like to enjoy it again at some point! if I could get a seat!
