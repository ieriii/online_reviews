It's funny, really.  My fiancee and I were a little worried about the food situation upon moving to Chicago. We had some Thai, some Vietnamese and some Lebanese only to be a little bit disappointed.  Demera totally blows that fear out of the water. This is hands down the best ethiopian food I've ever had in a great package of a nice place with friendly service at a fair price.  Seriously, if you haven't gone, do yourself a favor and go and get the meal of 10 vegetarian portions and you will be blown away.
