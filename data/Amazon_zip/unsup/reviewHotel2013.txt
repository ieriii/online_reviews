We recently purchased a one night stay through a coupon group and right from the time of booking through checkout our service was impeccable. The hotel was outstanding and spotless. The modern decor took our breath away. All areas of the hotel were spotless and for a busy hotel in this area of Chicago I find it so refreshing that even the air in the hallways and elevators seemed as if it were conditioned for our comfort. The staff was so nice to our two young grandchildren that we decided to have dinner in the on-site restaurant Felinni and this too was of top quality and so very reasonably priced for Chicago. We will make it a point to rebook if the opportunity should arise.
