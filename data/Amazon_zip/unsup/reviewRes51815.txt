Visiting Chicago for my high school reunion, my best friend wanted his wife to experience Chicago Deep Dish Pizza. Disappointed that we chose Gino's East! The hostess seemed annoyed at her job and got snippy with me when questioned about the 3 different lines you have to stand in to get seated. Our server seemed overwhelmed by her 3 tables. We didn't get our drinks until 1/2 way thru our appetizer, even though we were sitting right next to the fountain machine. She also had the nerve to make us feel rushed when it came time to pay the bill. Fried ravioli appetizer was good, but nothing spectacular. Pizza definitely not worth the 45 minute wait.  Next time we'll go to Lou's!
