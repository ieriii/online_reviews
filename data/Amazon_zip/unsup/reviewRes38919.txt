La Villa gives you a free pizza with 20 coupons--you get 1 coupon every time you order a pizza. We've gotten more free pizzas at my house over the years than I can actually recall. La Villa makes both my favorite thin crust and deep dish pizza in Chicago, a bold statement, I know. I prefer it to Lou's and Gino's and the rest. It's simply great pizza. I dig all its supercheesy goodness. The dining room is nice, too. The salad bar is more than sufficient. Lots of quality complimentary bread. Good pasta and good steaks. It feels like a nice neighborhood family establishment because it is.
