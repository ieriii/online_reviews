They have great beers and good ciders here. They have a nice bench waiting area where you can order drinks while you wait. The food really helps puts this place high on our list. For appetizers, the soft pretzel is one of our favorites. The beer cheese soup it comes with is the perfect dipping sauce. The wild boar meatballs were very flavorful and worth ordering. The smokehouse burger is one of my favorite things to order from here. A burger with pulled pork on top sounds intense, but it's very well put together. My husband always get something different every time we go. From the hombre burger to a cashew tofu curry he's liked everything he's had here. We've also had the smokehouse pizza which was really good.
