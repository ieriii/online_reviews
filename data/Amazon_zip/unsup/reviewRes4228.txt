This place definitely has potential, & I am sure it is cool if you are trying to change up your weekend routine, but don't come here if you aren't planning on listening to jazz being the main focus of your attention. Like some of the other reviewers, my friends & I somehow ended up here around 12:00 AM. Cover is $12, so be prepared. We'd been drinking a bit previously at another bar, but were nowhere near inebriated. One of the employees (an older gentleman who I'm not sure if he is the owner, manager, what...) got visibly irritated (rolling of the eyes was seen) w/my friend when she didn't take his offer of a booth. We did end up being escorted to a seat eventually, but he wasn't altogether nice about it. Once seated, we ordered our drinks & the musicians started another set. At this point, low murmurings of people could be heard around the bar of patron side conversations. Long story short, the same man came over to our table at least 3 times to tell us to keep it down (very curtly) & seemed to be watching us like a hawk for any wrong moves, even though other people were talking as well. The jazz musicians were great & if I were looking for a low key night of cocktails & jazz this would be a neat spot. Just don't look at this bar like a late-night option after the other bars or anything like that. The environment is too controlled.
