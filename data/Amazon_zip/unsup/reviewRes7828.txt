Everything about Fogo de Chao is amazing! Great location in the downtown Chicago area. Many Chicago lounges and nightclubs nearby for some entertainment after a great meal. There isn't a parking lot so parking may be hard to find but they do offer a cheap valet service which is the easiest way to go. The service is impeccable! For those who have never experienced dining at Fogo de Chao, they have a special way of serving you. You are given a "card" of some sort that has a red side and a green side to it. Whenever you want more food, flip the card to the green side, and a server will be at your table side within seconds. Whenever you don't want to be bothered, flip it to the red side and they'll leave you alone to enjoy your food. Aside from the amazing service, the food in excellent. Fogo de Chao features one of the largest and highest quality salad bars I've ever had. You serve yourself at the salad bar so you can create any variation of salad with different inredients every time. There's sun dried tomatoes, fresh salmon, olives, mozzarella balls, etc. etc. Along with the salad bar, the main part of Fogo de Chao, is the brazilian meats. Everything is so fresh and cut so well. There are over ten (I believe) different types of meat, all varying in taste, but all sustain high quality. The price tag may be a bit pricey for some, but with the service and quality of food, I think the price is more than reasonable (it's usually between $50 & $100 per person, I can't remember the exact price). But with unlimited amount of meat and salad bar, who can argue with that?
