I found exactly what I was looking for, behind an unmarked door on Damen, I am blown away by Violet Hour. The music, the gentle-volume conversation, the drinks, the service, the staff, the decor. Everything comes together to provide a relaxed and comfortable atmosphere which contributes to great conversation and company. Ill repeat what was on the lips of everyone that night: "I love this place"
