I have vowed to stop coming here late night - even if its the only place open. The past few times, the experience was exhausting and frustrating. First of all, the lighting is far too flourescent and highlights all the mascara-smudging of a long night drinking and dancing. Beyond that the ornate chairs are too heavy! Once I finally settle in and skooch up to the table, I've waited too long to order horchata and burrito. I fill up on chips and salsa (which is admittedly, fresh, good, and spicy), overeat my veggie burrito when it finally arrives (after 20 minutes!) and then wait uncomfortably for the server to present the check so I could get the hell out of there. Most recently, I had to leave some cash with my friends and just dip out.  Here's the bottom line -After a long night out, I expect my mediocre Mexican food to be served promptly. Waiting too long for pre-hangover food that isn't that tasty is excrutiating.
