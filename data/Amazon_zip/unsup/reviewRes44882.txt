There are two highly recommended places for deep dish pies - Giordano's and Lou Malnati's. I have to admit I prefer Lou Malnati's as their crust isn't nearly as thick as Giordano's.  Giordano's crust was really thick and heavy. After one slice I had to call it quits as the pie was simply too heavy for me. The flavors also weren't nearly as vibrant as Lou Malnati's. I got take out, but even then the service was just okay and the employees there seem to have a huge attitude. The way they acted you'd think they were doing you a favor taking your order. If you wanted to eat in, the wait when we went was thankfully only 15 minutes, but my friend and I were running late and needed to get to the airport. The Rush Street location has worse waits as the shortest wait we saw was 1 hour and 15 minutes...
