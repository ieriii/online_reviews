DATE/SEATING TIME: I've been to Yolk (South Loop) 5 or 6 times. Each time has been on a Saturday or Sunday morning.  I've always waited at least 45 minutes and sometimes closer to 90 minutes.  FOOD: Their food is generally very good.  In my experience 70% of what I've had has been outstanding, 20% average and 10% not very good. Some highlights include: OUTSTANDING - The banana bread french toast. It's served with a side of peanut butter and a little is all you need. It's rich and really good!  - The french toast trio. 1 slice of the banana bread, 1 slice of a lemon poppy seed and 1 of an orange pound cake. All 3 have their own unique topping (I think strawberry for the orange pound cake and blueberry for the lemon poppy seed). - The eggs Benedict. It's simple and good. The English muffin used has a great texture (not too hard/crunch like some I've had).  - The steak skillet. This has become my favorite and it's now my go to unless I'm craving sweet. Tender steak, large veggies, cheese and eggs. It's the perfect breakfast in my opinion. - The fresh squeezed orange and strawberry juice. It's worth the $4 price. AVERAGE - Their pancakes. I've tried to multi-grain, strawberry/chocolate (I think that's right) and plain. They've all been ok, but nothing that's made me want to come back. NOT VERY GOOD - The California omelette. I just didn't care for the combination of garlic, avocado, cheese and egg. Apart, they are all things I love to eat, so I thought this would be amazing. However, something about the taste was off. I ate less than a quarter of it and didn't take the rest home. PRICE: It's a little expensive. It's good food, and worth the price, but definitely more than the normal breakfast option. I'd say after tax/tip the price is somewhere around $15 to $20 a person. I recommend Yolk, but probably not as "the usual" breakfast spot.
