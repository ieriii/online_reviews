I've only been here once, but have always heard rave reviews from friends about how good the food is here. Well, they were certainly right! I had the white pepper garlic chicken over jasmine rice and I was in heaven. The thing that made them lose a star was the fact that when they are busy you are certainly going to wait for your food. They only split checks two ways (not good for a party of 3 or more), and they skimp out on the thai iced tea. It's too small for the price. All in all, I will be back though. I believe they have Vegan friendly options too.
