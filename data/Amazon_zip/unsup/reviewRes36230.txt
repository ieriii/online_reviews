I'd been in greek town a few times for Yelp events or other social reasons, but never even noticed Meli's. But after a friend told me about it and see the top reviews it seemed like a good place to try out for a late day brunch during the week.........yes, I'm in the job seeking mode again, so unusal eating habits are back in full swing again. The space is small, as I'm finding is true of many places on this strip. The place was not quite full, but people were coming in at a steady pace. We were seated by the window and were surrounded by tables with dishes that ALL looked good. Meli's menu is extensive to say the least and that doesn't even cover the Juices they serve and unfortunately for this visit I didn't try. From French Toast to Skillets to Crepes to even a section called "Healthy Habits", they have a little be of everything for everybody. I am......trying to be a little bit more healthy with my eating so I selected the Vegetable Omelet - my dining partner had a Skillet. The order was filled very quickly....so much so I was surprised how fast the food came out. The food was very good, hot, and full of flavor. We lingered and enjoyed the meal, but the amount of food was significant...so much so I took half of the meal home and at it for breakfast for the next 2 days?!?!? Service, food, and selection makes Meli a must bookmark for you on Yelp and a must try in the near future if you haven't already. Next time I'll try the Juices as I hear they are just as great as the food!!!
