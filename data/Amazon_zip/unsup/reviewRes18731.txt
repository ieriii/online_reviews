A little expensive for a burger in the neighborhood, but while the price is high, the creativity is there. I enjoyed the Belly Burger which had a pork belly added on top of the already very good burger. Curry fries.... skip the seasoning and stick with the standard fare. Love the big beer list... if you can't find it there, you shouldn't drink it. Surprisingly empty on a sunny Sunday afternoon, but maybe everyone else was outside enjoying the weather instead of munching on a hamburger. Also, FYI, they do have a good kids menu. And to the woman reviewing and mentioning babies in capital letters. Get over it. You're in a family neighborhood. Maybe you should pick your neighborhoods more carefully before you sit down to dine.
