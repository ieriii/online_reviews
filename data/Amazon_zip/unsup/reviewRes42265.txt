I've been going to this place for many years and its still as good today as it was the first time. Service is not amazing, but its quick and helpful. The menu is quite large so its best to know something about Vietnamese food or you might find yourself lost in the menu. Pho is tasty and perfect for a cold Chicago day. I love the bun at this location... very good!  This is my favorite spot in town for great Pho and Bun.
