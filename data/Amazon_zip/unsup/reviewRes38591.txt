We really used to like this bar when we first moved into the area. It does seem like it has gotten to be super trendy though. Now there is never anywhere to sit, and it's pretty hard to even get near the bar. The beer selection is awesome, but also pretty expensive. And forget about the food. If i want to pay that much for dinner I'll go to a restaurant. Just my two cents.
