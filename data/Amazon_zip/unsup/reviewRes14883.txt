I went to Revolution on a Thursday night. Our server (wish I could remember her name) was awesome- friendly, witty, attentive etc. We started off with the bacon fat popcorn- whoa. Off the charts good, and terribly unhealthy. I then ordered the mustard herb chicken sandwich, which may have been the best grilled chicken sandwich I've ever had. You know that feeling when you order a grilled chicken- "ok, I've had this before, it's the healthy choice but nothing exciting, they all taste the same..." This was tender, had some really unique flavor and was huge. On top of that, the inhouse beers were brewed right- tasty stuff. Technically I'd give this 4.5 stars but who's counting? Check the place out for sure.
