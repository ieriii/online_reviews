Hmm. Well I wanted to like this place a lot more than I did. I've driven by it numerous times and when I saw it on Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives, it was the push I needed to stop in and check it out. As always, I did my yelp homework before I went in and scoped out some of the most recommended things on the menu. I went with the soy oatmeal shake, which was, hands down, my favorite thing that we ordered. My friend had the mango shake, and she liked it a lot. We shared the chifrijo for an app - also pretty tasty. The pork was fried crispy and the pico complimented the richness of the pork and the buttery avocado well.  Then things went a bit downhill. I opted for the potato tacos upon the recommendation of our server. In full disclosure, I don't like mashed potatoes, but I still thought they sounded good, so I went with them. I don't even think that the mashed potato was the part about the taco I didn't like. And it's not that I didn't like them. They were just a little on the bland side (and also pretty heavy). I went with both the mole and the guac as my sauce. The mole was decent, if not a little...I don't really know what...I just didn't feel like the spices melded as well as they should in a mole. The guac was okay though it seemed like my particular portion suffered from a few bad avocados. My friend's steak (the el tico) was a little on the dry/chewy side. The flavor was decent but I prefer my steak much more medium rare, so I was glad I didn't get a beef dish.   For $25, our food was fine and I'm glad I tried this place out. I wouldn't object to returning but I have a lot more eating to do before I'll go out of my way to come back...though I might have to consider it for the oatmeal shake.
