This place is hands down the best fondu place I've ever been to. Geja's Cafe gives you as many refills as you want for the cheese and the bread. This is the only Geja's Cafe in all of America and it is the GREATEST. The interior is super cozy. I went with my boyfriend for the first time last year and we were seriously impressed. I called in to make a reservation one time and they said they were completely full for the night. We showed up in hopes that we could wait at least an hour and we waited only 10 minutes! The bar area is the official "wait room." I'm not 21, but there were little pots of cheese and crackers to keep my mouth busy. The cheese spread was amazing. I felt bad because I kept eating it...but it was too good. A++++++++
