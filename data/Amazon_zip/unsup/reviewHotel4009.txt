My boyfriend & I stayed the weekend 7/6th-8th for a small getaway before he leaves for military training. I must say I loved our room. We had a beautiful view, beds were comfortable and had some good carrott cake!! Location is perfect...near navy pier, AMC & Lucky Strikes and of course Michigan Ave! Good times!
