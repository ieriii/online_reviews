Irazu is just is one of the best restaurants in this city. The food is hot, green, fresh, zesty, flawless. Never skimping on the fillings, sides, or sauces where others hold back - whether with the garlic, avocado, peppers, or black beans - the offerings taste as fresh as they are generous in portion. It is easy to leave here in danger of being overfull.   Besides the food, Irazu just kills in the other categories: price, atmosphere, service. Food is more important than all these things, but price is a constraint you cannot tune out like the other two, and Irazu, for the portions, is pretty much as good a deal for great food as you can find outside of Hot Doug's or your favorite place for fried rice. The burritos are just immense, the patacones are plentifully plated, the shakes tall. It is hardly an exaggeration to say that given the quality and quantity that they could double the price on half their items without losing many customers. Especially in Wicker Park. The biggest money saver, however, may be that it is BYOB and located across the street from a high-end boutique of beer, wine and spirits, which is an awesome convenience. The service is so warm you either wonder how someone can be so exuberant at work or feel ashamed for complaining so much at/about your own job. If they don't remember who you are by face - and I think they do - they do an amazing job pretending, and in sincerely treating returning customers like friends. If I ever get in a debate as to whether a cheap eat can match fine dining, I bring up Irazu. Most times that I get some delicious $30-plus entre elsewhere I still say to myself "Irazu's spinach burrito is as good." Sitting outside in the summer is a perfect way to start your night. In the winter, you may opt for their delivery service, which goes from Des Moines to Memphis. Actually, I think Pulaski to the lake and Roosevelt to Montrose. How that's profitable, I have no idea. Clearly, the ownership is driven so much by that.
