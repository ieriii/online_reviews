I have been eating at Nuevo Leon since the age of 2 or 3. Just like the previous reviewer, I also remember when it was just one dining room (and also a lot less gentrified). I had not been to Nuevo Leon for a good 5 or six years, and that was just way to long. So I took the wife for lunch there on a rare day off and we had ourselves some top notch, old school, hardcore Mexican food. We started out with an appetizer of Taquitos Daniel (5 small barbacoa tacos with cilantro and onion). My wife had the Chicken Enchiladas en Mole and I had the Tacos de Sabinas. The appetizer was amazing the barbacoa was lean and well seasoned. My tacos were just plain damn good. The Tacos had tender rib eye steak that was grilled and then slow cooked in a red sauce with beans and Chihuahua Cheese piled on. I tried some of my wife's enchiladas and the Mole was solid. There is only one thing that I regretted, I should have ordered an orange flavored Jarritos Mexican pop to go with my meal. The trip from Evanston to Pilsen was definitely worth it. If anyone is worried about the location, put any concerns to rest. This neighborhood has been changing so much that there is a coffee shop that serves Lattes at the other end of the block and if you go down to Halsted and 14th Street, there is a Jamba Juice and Cold Stone Creamery there. Even if this place is that close to a Jamaba Juice, it still has serious street cred. Believe me, it will not take as long as it did to go back to Nuevo Leon.
