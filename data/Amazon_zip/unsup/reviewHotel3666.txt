This is a classy old-fashioned hotel. I had a great stay here in the spring of 2006 and would love to stay here again. The staff was warm and inviting, and always willing to help or answer any questions. I really like the great old bar downstairs with the red leather booths and dark wood paneled walls. Great location as well.
