Fresh and spicy Red dragon. Hot salty fresh edaname. Delivery, or dine in - the same quality. I'm a Red Dragon fan and I always order it where ever I go. Butterfly doesn't get it and holy smokes don't try ordering sushi period at Thalia. Sushi X is always fresh and delvers the quality I have to have.
