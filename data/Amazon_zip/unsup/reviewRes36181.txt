Ordered their highly popular duck one day in advance with my reservation. Got there specifically for the duck. Took 20 minutes to get a server. Watched duck by duck by duck go by. Finally re-ordered my duck. Waited 30 minutes, brough out all of the rest of our food without the duck. They "ran out". Was compensated with a free duck next time but unpleasant about my first experience. Will obviously have to try again. But if you are going for a duck be adamant about getting a server once you sit down.
