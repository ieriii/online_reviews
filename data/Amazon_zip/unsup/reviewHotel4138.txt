I got this room off of priceline for $80. It was right on Michigan, which I loved. Yes it is a convention hotel but it was still pretty inside, with lots at your fingertips, including on site restaurants, coffee shops and souvenier shops.  The staff was all incredibly helpful and very nice. WE called down to them for recommendations about 4-5 times and had great ideas each time... The room was very clean and very nice, high thread count linens and plush towels. They even helped my boy plan a romantic little setup in the room for me (rose petals, a vase of tulips, wine and chocolate covered strawberries)! We got a room at the end of the hallway, which was nice as well. the only downside was that I could hear the VERY loud girls across the hall all night.
