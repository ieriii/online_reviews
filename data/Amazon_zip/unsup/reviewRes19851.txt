Bayless, you'll always be in my heart when it comes to Mexican cuisine. My visit to XOCO has been long overdue so here' the deal: My advice to you is coming for lunch, or during the week. If you're a patient person (which I am not), then brave the lines on the weekends and bustling atmosphere packed like sardines in a small space. The service was friendly and quick. Eat your food, enjoy it, and get out so the next group of people can enjoy! I like to enjoy my food, conversation and space bubble, so I will dine here only during the week when it's a little (less) of the madness. One word. CHURROS...get them...right when you sit down, or for dessert. It doesn't really matter, but as long as you taste their lovely sweetness. Don't miss out on this! You can never go wrong with some chips and guac. At any of the Bayless restaurants, you can expect some of the freshest tasting guac around! You also need to order the Tortas. The griddled Milanesa chicken was by far my favorite, but you really can't go wrong with any of them. I've waited too long to visit XOCO and now my mouth is watering for more!
