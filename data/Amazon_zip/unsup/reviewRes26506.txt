I'm not sure how Nuevo Leon got to be seen as being head-and-shoulders above the rest of Pilsen, but it's not a reputation that it fully deserves. Nuevo Leon can get pretty full, and at popular hours the line will often extend past the door. This usually convinces me to go elsewhere, if I wasn't planning on doing so already. But the last time I went I was out late with a few friends and they were one of the only places still open, so we sat down. However, the servers seem to stick to their quickened routines even when the place isn't full. We had to ask more than once for water refills, which isn't a huge deal. But our waiter also stuck by the rule against substitutions, which is stated explicitly several times on the menu already. There's no good reason for this rule to exist, even when the restaurant is packed. Substitutions don't make things easier on the restaurant, and they only serve to make customers unhappy. When I tried to order 3 tacos, I was told that I could only order one type of meat. In fact our waiter actually told me that there was no way I could get different tacos. This was for a "combination" plate that already charged more per taco than most places in the neighborhood. The tacos themselves came very greasy, and the asada was nothing special. I had to take more fatty pieces out than I would have liked. Nuevo Leon doesn't put anything in your tacos, either. Instead, they throw a humble pile of tomato slices, lettuce, onion, and cilantro on the side of your plate. It's barely enough to fill up all three. That said, the other food here is generally pretty solid. I'm just not sure why one would come here when there are better places in Pilsen. There's certainly no reason to stand in line.
