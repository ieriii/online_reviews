Ok, so I'm not a fan of deep dish pizza. That's right, I said it. Anyway, an old friend came in from out of town and naturally wanted to get some Chicago style eats. Pequod's was her choice, I was just there for the conversation. Turns out that this is THE ONLY deep dish pizza that I've ever enjoyed. The caramelized cheese crust was awesome, but what I really liked was the fact that this wasn't just a pie crust filled with cheese, as I've had at many other places. The dough was fluffy and soft and the bottom of the pizza was super crispy.  All and all it was a damn good pizza. The service was great as well. Pricey beer, though. And just to clear things up - their mushrooms are NOT canned, as one other reviewer had said (all of our toppings were super fresh and yummy.) I may go back there someday if I'm ever wanting deep dish, but I don't really see that happening. Hey, at least now I know that I don't find all Chicago style pizza inedible! Kudos, Pequod's.
