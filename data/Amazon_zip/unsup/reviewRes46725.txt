Watch out for the salad bar!! While it houses delicious food, the last time I went there, my date walked full on into the salad bar corner, which is covered with a golf ball. It is just at forehead level and kind of creeps up on you when you walk around the corner.  Just walk slowly or you will end up with a golf ball sized (with indentations) bump on your forehead. (ask J)
