Artopolis is such a great Greektown gem...delicious food and friendly staff. There is seating upstairs, downstairs on street level and in the main dining area near the coffee bar. Its great people watching and seeing the older Greek men drink their coffee and chat as they watch the Greek news. The lunch specials are all under $10 and a great deal for a large side salad and soup, sandwich or artopita (nothing like a pita, no idea why they call it that because its a delicious flaked crust filled with cheese and meat, mushrooms or spinach). I would stay away from ordering the hot meals like the salmon. They're ok but not really what the cafe is known for.
