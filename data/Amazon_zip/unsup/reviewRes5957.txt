Wildfire is so good. A friend of mine and I went here recently because he had some special top-secret deal where some of our meal was paid for or something. Good thing, too, because there is no way I would ever be able to suddenly decide to eat here otherwise. It is pricey, my friends. I think people that eat here pay in gold bullion and wear underwear made out of rubies. I got a dish that was literally called "Ribs & Ribs." The name could not be more explanatory. It turned out to be ribs and ribs. One rack was baby back and the other was St. Louis style with a honey mustard glaze. Both were quite good, although I think the latter was much tastier. My friend's meal was pretty good, too. He got the rack of pork, and I even tasted it with my own mouth! I would definitely go back if I could afford it, because I thoroughly enjoyed myself.
