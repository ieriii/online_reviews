I have a mixed review for this place...it was cheap so I understand you don't get as much, but my first night of sleep was painful....bright light leaked in from the curtains from outside and since I'm a light sleeper the light kept waking me up. The next night I got creative and I put a bed sheet over the window frame which blocked the light. I also ran the air-conditioning at night to block the noise from the Ltrain. Pros - cheap, air conditioning works, good location, clean room Cons - Small small room, no parking for cars, elevators took a while
