I read about Wilde in the Chicago Tribune long before I tried it, and almost forgot about it until one day, shortly after moving here, when a friend suggested it. Then it all came rushing back to me. The paper had, in some fashion, made the point that its an Irish-inspired gay-friendly pub named after Oscar Wilde, who for lack of better definition, was also gay-friendly. haha Wilde certainly seems to have a beautiful tap on Irish inspiration for the pub design/decor (or wait, maybe that's the gay-friendly part)...but whatever it is, the inside is gorgeous, warm and cozy. An elevated seating area in the central area of the bar is surrounded by book-lined shelves and a faux stain glass skylight. And drawing on its literary namesake, the books and decor really feed into the rich persona that Mr. Wilde created from his work. That all said, it's been hot a couple of times during the summer when I've been there, with some poor air circulation once the front windows are opened to the patio area. Certainly not a reason to avoid the place, just order a cold drink without alcohol (since the drinks are overpriced and underpoured anyhow). Food is fantastic--I've tried some of the various soups, but as entrees go, I've stuck with the Irish and Cheddar Chopped Salad or the Macaroni and Cheese. Both are fabulous -- obviously the latter being a bit less healthy and for heaver in term sof how you feel when you get up to leave. But it is sooooo good. Food is one other thing, too--a bit expensive. I'm not saying it isn't worth it, but it falls into that price/value situation that requires every consumer to decide for themselves. There just isn't a super clear "This was worth every penny!" feeling when you're done...so decide for yourself. Service is friendly but not terribly responsive...but really, I'n not going there trying to sell a client on a project within 30 minutes, so I don't stress much about wait times. 3 stars only - 1 star off for the service, 1 star off for the prices.
