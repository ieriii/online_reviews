I LIKE the pizza here. Face it, we live in a city full of 'za critics. Some like it deep-dish, some like it thin crust...blah blah blah. Me? I am open-minded when it comes to pizza. I like most all pizza. Like several people have told me, "Pizza is like sex; even when it's bad, it's still pizza." True dat.  In any event, I like the thin crust action here. Sausage and banana peppers on a red pizza (read: traditional marinara and mozzarella) did the trick for us along with some of their crafty beers. Was a tasty meal. Goat cheese appetizer was alright, but I've had better elsewhere. Probably would not order it again. A little pricey, but hey, sometimes it's worth it for a little piece in your life. (Stop groaning, it was a clever pun.)
