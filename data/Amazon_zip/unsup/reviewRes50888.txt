I really want to love this place but I couldn't. My server was very odd.....she kept using the wrong pronouns to address our party. "Can we get this out of our waaaayyy?" She was condescending and inauthentic. The lack of authenticity matched the poor food. My mom is from the South and I grew up eating southern food. I thought it was a good choice for my parents since they generally like unfussy food. Sadly, nothing appealed to us on the menu. I had the fried seafood platter, which was pretty good, nothing spectatular and I would've appreciated a heads up on the fact that there were no sides; just fries with it. Do you think I needed more fried stuff with my fried fish? Could I get a side of greens with that? At any rate, it was a total waste of calories. My dad had a pulled pork sandwich that was ok, My mom had the sweet tea brined pork, which was also fair; boyfriend had a burger. There was nothing big or special about anything we had except for the big bill. We also had some very average desert with some weird spicy ice cream......I hope that does not become the next food trend! The only thing that was really good were the homemade corn muffins. Now that was exceptional!!! Last word: Please don't waste your money on this joint.
