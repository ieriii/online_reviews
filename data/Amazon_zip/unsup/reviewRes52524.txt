Overall a wonderful experience. I came here with an old school friend to treat him after his college graduation. We tried all of the meats including the New York Strip, Pork Ribs, and Bacon Filet Mignon. No lobster that day though. My favorite has the house special Coulette or rump cut, so flavorful! And of course, the grilled pineapple was excellent. Definitely take advantage of the salad bar to balance out your meal, and utilize the various coupons on there on the internets to lighten your check.
