Surprisingly delish bar food. This is why I love Chicago. Good drinks, good food, and its not expensive. We had the goat cheese pita appetizer.. and it was really good. Came with a salad that had julienne pears and walnuts. All really good together. The beau had some Goose Island Christmas ale and ordered the Chicago Reuben on a pretzel bun with waffle fries. It was like a notch up from regular bar food. Then I had a mixed green salad with honey balsmic dressing and pears and tomatoes. That was all delish. I got salmon on top of my salad and that was my bad for ordering salmon at a bar, cause it wasn't very fresh and I didn't eat it. Our waitress was super sweet and attentive even though the host warned us that she was working alone tonight and had 11 tables. We left a good tip and went home happy as clams :D
