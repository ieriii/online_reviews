i've never stayed at the hotel but i did work with them to plan our med school Winter Formal. We got an awesome deal on catering and drinks and the staff was more than happy to have our group. The room where we were was amazing! The light up dancefloor gave it just what we needed to make the formal a huge success. they were more than accomodating and i would not hesitate to work with them again. my only complaint (and it was partly our fault because we got started late) was that they picked up dinner plates really quickly and some people were not done eating yet. other than that everything went off without a hitch!
