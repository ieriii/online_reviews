Absolute deliciousness! I'm half Korean and grew up with Korean food. However, my mom sure didn't make fried chicken this good. I was so excited when Crisp opened a few years back. It has definitely become my go-to place when I'm craving some spicy bi bim bop and am too lazy to make it myself. When my brother visits from Michigan, stopping for lunch is de rigeur. We split a half chicken with Seoul Sassy sauce and a baby buddha bowl. Allison's Atomic sauce and the mushrooms are quite good too.
