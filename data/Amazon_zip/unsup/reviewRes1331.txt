The trip would have been just perfect if it wasn't 50 degrees, windy and raining that visit. Go on a nice day because no matter what time you do go, there will be a line out the door. Good things come to those who wait.... And as we waited, our excitement and hunger grew. I think we changed our minds a dozen times before we hit the counter but settled on these: Grilled hot dog with the works: perfect Chicago dog The Sally Vega Corn dog: our 12 year old insisted it was the best dog she has had Foie GRAS duck sausage: good but not a do over Thai chicken sausage: spicy and the favorite of us all but not on regular menu And do not forget the duck fat fries, yes they taste better than regular fries and yes they are with it. Overall, I think this is the hot dog spot to go in the city and to try something a bit different. It was not, for me, the Chicago place I will move mountains to get back to. My heart belongs to the sushi, Thai, and Indian restaurants.
