I came to Chicago to visit a sick friend and i wanted to try some deepdish pizza. I'm from New Jersey where there's no shortage of great pizza....but not much quality deep dish. After reading many reviews, we landed ourselves in pequods on N. Clybourn. I've got to say their deepdish pizza was the best i ever had!!! We also stopped at Giordanos, and pequods puts them to shame. The pizza was loaded with excellent toppings, the sauce was very flavorful and oh my god the carmalized crust was awesome.......i ate every bite of that crust. If anyone can tell me where they make better deepdish please let me know and i'll fly in just to try it!!!             Bravo Pequods, Bravo!!!
