They have great beer and a very slick setup, but they seem a bit too occupied with their image and the food is gimmicky. The unsatisfying small platter portions and their horrible service on both of my visits didn't help win me over either.  Hopefully they'll learn after the novelty of the restauarant wears off and their initial surge in customers starts dropping, leading to a patch-up job on their weaknesses.
