After spending 8+ hours preparing Asian food last Wednesday, my friend suggested we grab falafel sandwiches at Sultan's. I'd never been or heard of the place before, though I've been a fan of Mediterranean food long before I became vegetarian three years ago. From the efficient setup ~ short, simple menu; speedy, cafeteria style service, cash only ~ to the generously portioned, perfectly fried falafel sandwich, Sultan's Market is a well-oiled machine. I was so impressed, I went back last night! I'm a firm believer that you get what you pay for, but at Sultan's you get MORE than that. At $3.75, the falafel sandwich is a very satisfying portion. I also like the little hot sauce & tahini sauce bar at the door ~ the sauces really complement the sandwich well. Although I've only tried the falafel sandwich so far, I can't wait to try everything on the menu. I've taken my order to go both times, but the dine-in area seems clean & comfy. The one thing that would make Sultan's perfect is a BYOB license!  Kudos for great, simple, inexpensive, vegetarian, authentic Mediterranean fare in Chicago!!
