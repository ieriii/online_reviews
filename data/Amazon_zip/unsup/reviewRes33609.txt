Best salad bar ever! Be careful not to load up on the heavier stuff though, because they charge by weight. The lentil soup is delicious, but sort of reminds me of the gravy at KFC. It definitely tastes chicken broth based, so beware vegetarians. As long as you're not going for the salad bar, this place is a great value. Split the spicy falafel wrap overflowing with goodness and a cup of soup with a friend for under $10. The servers aren't the nicest guys, but that won't keep me away.
