I had a lovely dinner at the Gage last summer. Oh sure I was wearing five inch heels and I tripped and rolled half way there - which worked up quite an appetite for yours truly... But as I remember it , it was a delicious dinner complete with marrow bones which for a former vegetarian oddly strikes me as FOOD FOR THE GODS. I don't know why I haven't gone there again other than its sidewalks are dangerous. OK that's not at all true. I don't know why, it just fell off the list. So a person I know came into town and suggested that we have dinner and pondering the equidistant between his hotel and my home, I thought the Gage would be a great choice. and it was, more or less....Good things are; * I did not trip on my way there. * My companion chose a romantic table in the back of the restaurant that was below freezing - which the Manager quickly corrected, bless you Manager * Smart sexy waiter who really, really knew the menu + and - and how to guide our choices - MUCH appreciated! * I had a delicious cocktail * The pork belly and squid appetizer was far too small but oh my so delicious * I had a spectacular glass of wine ( a Gamay Beaujolais and if i didn't spell that correctly too bad) * The Tuna dish was AMAZING Bad things are: * My companion chose a romantic table at The back of the restaurant errrr, not quite right * the scotch egg was old - well lets say it was dry and not good * I ordered the Saddle of Elk and would have preferred a Saddled Elk that I could ride into the sunset. I love Elk and this one was not the tender medium rare that I had requested. Oh no - it was a bloody cold hunk of flesh, seared and still making whatever noises Elk make. * Handsome sexy waiter lost interest in us as soon as our food came - sigh- I sure would have liked another glass of wine - because that's how I roll In conclusion. I gage The Gage to be good not great. Too Bad...
