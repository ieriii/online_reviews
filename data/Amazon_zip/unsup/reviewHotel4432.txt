Beautiful hotel with friendly staff. Prices are high for drinks ($4 for a cup of coffee, $14 for a vodka cranberry..) we would have loved to spend more of our time in the hotel, especially the lobby, but the prices are too high. The hotel is huge, rooms are comfortable and affordable. Location is great, close to lots of places to shop and eat. We'll stay again, though will continue to go out to other places for meals and drinks.
