On a Tuesday evening at 9:30pm, there was a 30 minute wait. I love Chicago! I was a bit apprehensive since their sign is right on Mag Mile (= touristy) so may be able to take advantage of foot traffic and skip the attempt at quality service or food. Thankfully, I was very pleasantly proven wrong. Just me, so I sat at one of the high community tables when a seat opened up. Friendly folks sitting there were kind enough to let me join :-) Server was right out with a wine list and a menu. I could have looked for an hour through that wine list! Stuck with a glass of rose cava was very pleased that it was a dry and crisp as recommended. Service was kind, unpretentious and efficient. They have a dozen + small plates to choose from, and I chose the duck salad to start. An amazing mix of herbs and flavour and the duck was fantastic. Excellent! Cheese plate with a truffle goat that was heaven came next as I didn't have enough room for another small entree and dessert, and figured a cheese plate could meet both desires. Atmosphere is incredibly lively and loud, so go with that in mind if you want a serious conversation with anyone :-) I only wish I lived closer (as CA is a bit far to go for dinner) to try out their other fantastic looking dishes!
