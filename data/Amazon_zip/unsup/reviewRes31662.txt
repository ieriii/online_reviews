I cannot say enough positive things about this place. Atmosphere - awesome and chill Service - phenomenal Food - Oh my delicious, unique, incredible sushi. Truffled tataki tuna sashimi.... freaking amazing. Everything we ate there was so delicious. I had a 007 martini that was mixed perfectly. I've tried a lot of sushi places and this place definitely tops the list of best sushi. I highly recommend this place for sushi lovers. i didn't try anything other than sushi so I can't speak for anything else. Yum Yum Yum... I want to go back...
