If I could give 3.5 stars, I would. Since I'm between 3 and 4 and can't really say I'm a fan, 3 it is. For the price, the hotel and our room were surprisingly good. No free wifi but otherwise the amenities were satisfactory. Apparently there was a renovation recently - the room was clean and comfortably modern. Checking in and out was relatively smooth. There were two main things that bothered me. First, the chaotic nature of the hotel lobby. It was a busy weekend (air and water show) and I felt like they weren't quite prepared for it. It was raining the first morning, and it took about 30 minutes to get a taxi through the teeming mass of hydrophobic hotel goers. There wasn't much organization and the hotel didn't seem to have any pull to get a good supply of cabs. Second, the concierge desk was overall pretty useless and almost, well, snotty. Also, it costs $20 to rent an umbrella. It's refundable, but you can't put it on your bill and you can't use a card. It's $20 cash or kick rocks. The location is good but I thought the hotels a bit further north gave a better starting point to get around the city.
