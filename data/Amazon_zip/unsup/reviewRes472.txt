I dined here a few months back and just didn't get around to writing the review right away. Anyway, Alinea is outstanding! While it is very expensive (two people, smaller tasting w/ wine pairings and tip = $700) it is well worth it. This is more than a dinner, it is an experience... look at it as a dinner and entertainment (a play for example).... hopefully, this well help justify the price tag and if not, you do get a pillow filled with lavender air to look forward to! The most surprising thing about Alinea was the atmosphere. Although it is very upscale, there were still multiple people photographing there food and laughing out loud... pretty cool that the place could stay so down to earth. Great food, great service, great wine.... a must go for special occasions! Small aside: Watch for the door when you enter building its a crazy looking hallway.
