I'm glad that a place like this has come to Logan. There's not much I love more than food and drink and Logan has been lacking in diversity until lately. The place is cool and kind of hidden and I like the overall look inside as well (especially the cool artistic scrap wood ceiling!) The whiskey list is huge and really affordable and the few dishes we had were really good. Overall, I say go get some whiskey and good classic french inspired food in your belly asap.
