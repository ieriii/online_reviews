One of my new favorite places to go in Chicago. The food was amazing, and the beer was out of this world. Service was also great, and our group of six got a seat without a wait (it was Monday though, to be fair. Went back that Friday with a group of three and also found a seat immediately). I had the farm burger with the potato salad side, both very tasty. I asked for medium rare and, wonder of wonders, it actually came out medium rare. My favorite, though, was their beer. I had the wit, which they apparently just finished brewing that night. Best beer I've ever had in my life. I like this place so much I was back in there the same week.
