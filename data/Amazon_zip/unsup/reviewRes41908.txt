This is THE place for pho! Been here countless times and the broth tastes amazing. My bowl is always empty when I leave :) There's been one or two times when I thought the noodle was overcooked (perhaps left in there too long?), but the broth is so delicious that I forgive them. The noodle soups are slightly more expensive than the other places in Argyle but worth it. Try the vermicelli soups under the exotic category is something different. Service is fast and attentive. It is usually crowded on weekend nights so plan accordingly. Very casual seating and atmosphere.
