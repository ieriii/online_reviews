I don't know about you Geja's. Maybe I came in with crazy high expectations, or maybe it was the fact that I was starving, but I definitely wasn't impressed. We arrived on time for our reservation and had to wait in the bar for a half hour, understandable. It was prime dinner time on a Friday so I won't complain. It's very dark inside with a Mediterranian feel. Dinner was fine, that's about all I can say about it. The oil isn't seasoned or flavored at all, and everything came out of it tasting exactly the same. If it hadn't been for texture difference I would have thought that my chicken and potatoes were the same thing. Definitely a fun dinner, but for the price tag, I don't think I'll ever be back. Bummer.
