This is the best cuban I've had in Chicago hands down...I love the music, the enclosed patio in back, the murals, the staff, the general feel of the place...everything! Everything they have made out of plaintains is tasty...the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is the yucca was pretty stale but the lemony garlic stuff they put on my yuca frita made it taste good...but still the yucca could be better. My Ropa Vieja was excellent and I am definitely coming back here and bringing more people with me! 5 Stars from me if they improve their yucca!
