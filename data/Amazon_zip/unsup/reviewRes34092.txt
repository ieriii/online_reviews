The ambiance is good - I always take my family and friends there when they come to visit me downtown - but it's not your usual mom and pop's cozy kind of environment. I'd go to Meli's in Greektown for that. Yolk usually gets packed, especially on Sundays. Food is really good and so is the price. All the great reviews speak for themselves.
