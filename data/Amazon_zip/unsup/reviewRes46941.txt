My wife and I went to Uncommon Ground for lunch/early supper. Great experience. Our server Nathan was excellent and service was prompt. We got there about 4pm on a Saturday and the place was almost empty. A great time to go if you want to be the crowds. We had the sweet potato fries as an appetizer. I have had sweet potato fries from quite a few places but these are the best and the goat cheese to dip them in is nice. I had the macaroni and cheese as my main course and it did not disappoint. I make homemade mac and cheese myself so I was a little leary but it was the best I have had in a restaurant. My wife had the pumpkin ravioli and it was very fresh tasting and you could tell that the ingredients were fresh and not frozen like Olive Garden(sorry to anyone that likes Olive Garden). We had the double chocolate cake with blueberry and it was unbelievable. It was not overly sweet but just enought osatisfy your sweet tooth. Overall I would rate Uncommon Ground an A+ organic restaurant and they don't skimp on flavor or portions. I think it is cheap for an organic restaurant. I have been to Maggianos and dropped just as much coin. Anyway check em out, you won't regret it. We are going back as soon as we can. Sidenote: they have their own parking lot which is free. A premium on Devon st.
