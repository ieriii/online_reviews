I heard great things about this place from a friend who is a regular here and I was not disappointed. I went for brunch with a group of 5 friends. Half of our group arrived extremely late for our reservation (45 minutes late), but the hostess was very understanding and allowed us to change our reservation and then wait in the lounge area for our friends. The service was great and the food was delicious. The fireplace in the lounge area was very inviting on a snowy day. Our table ordered eggs benedict (a special), a seasonal scramble, a seasonal flatbread, and a burger with fried egg on top, and they were all delicious. The mimosas were the perfect combination of sweet + bubbly, and the bloody marys were heralded as perfect by those who ordered them. Side note: I ordered a cappuccino and was asked if I wanted a small or large. I said large and it came in a BOWL. Huge cappuccino. Very tasty, but I couldn't finish it.
