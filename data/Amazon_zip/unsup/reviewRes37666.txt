The most excellent choices of beers from around the world.... followed up by DELICIOUS food. The atmosphere of the front is nice, but confusing and cramped, and also weird that the restaurant is a jaunt up the handicap ramp? Its just got a weird set up of of two places really. But once you move past the wait of getting seated to eat which you can enjoy a beer during:) ... the food is such a unique and yet simple menu and just darn right gooood. The last time I was there we had this bacon wrapped pheasant which I wouldn't really just order me up some pheasant anywhere but the way this place does things you want to order real game-y type foods like pheasant and rabbit... Its definitely a meat lover treat. However I also had this butternut squash ravioli which makes those veggies out there go nuts for foods with FLAVOR!  Seriously a truly delightful experience for the mouth. However you want to take that its GOOD.
