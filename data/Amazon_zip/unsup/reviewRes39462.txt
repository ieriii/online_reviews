My visit to L&E is what I'd like to call a "happy accident". My friend and I had no plans of coming and were instead going to get tapas at Azucar next door. On our way over I told my dinner companion it happened to be next to L&E (a place we've both been wanting to try but have never bothered due to the feared wait time) and she suggests we just peak in and ask how long a table will be. We stepped inside to a very busy restaurant but noticed a not so busy patio section. Boy were we lucky that it wasn't super warm out and apparently no one was brave enough to handle the fall-like weather because we barely waited 10 minutes for a table at 7pm on a Friday! We started the night with delicious cocktails, a manhattan and a dark & stormy---so so good!  What can I say about the amazing food that hasn't already been said. Just one delicious plate after another. We shared 3 small plates and one entree: roasted bone marrow, scallops on a bed of black truffle gnocchi, pork cheek, and pork belly on a bed of butternut risotto. Seriously---if not the best meal I've ever had, EASILY in my top 3. And now, onto dessert. Oh, the dessert(s) of my dreams. One look at the menu and my friend decided we needed to get 2 and not 1 (this is why we're friends). We ended up picking one of their newer menu items (straight from their fb page: Maple & Bourbon Cornbread Pudding, Blueberry Compote, Pine Nute Jelly, Cinnamon & Pine Nut Ice Cream) and then the gruyere donuts topped with parmesan and a side of marscapone and fig jam. I can honestly say that these 2 desserts were the best desserts I have ever tasted in my 29 yrs on this planet. I mean, donuts with cheese inside? GENIUS. Pricewise, I really don't think we spent an outrageous amount (~$50 a piece plus tip) for the amount of food, drinks, and dessert we got but also for the crazy-amazing (cramazing?) quality of the all of the food. Definitely will be going back to try other fancy cocktails and for more delicious food!!
