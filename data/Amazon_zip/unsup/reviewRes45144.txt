I went there tonight for my first time and left full and pleased with my meal! We had reservations at 6 and then because of pouring rain and parking issues were a few minutes late. When we checked in, the host was a little rude, reminding us we were late (yes, we knew but did our best to get there on time) and then seated us with a huff. Okay, not the best way to start but what lacked in a greeting made up for in food. My friend and I got the grilled octopus (amazing!!!) and daily special of blood orange salad, which was refreshing and sweet. Portion sizes were easy to share and a nice way to tee up the meal. For dinner, I got the maltagliati with house smoked pork belly, fagioli, spinach, tomato and it was really delicious. It had really good flavors and was light. The great thing is that Anteprima also offers full and half sizes of the meals so you can get additional dishes or get better portion control. I got the pasta as a full dish and it was still a good size portion without being too heavy or filling. For dessert, we got the lemon panna cotta, which was good and had a Greek yogurt consistency. It was good and definitely perfect to share, it would have been to heavy on its own. Finally, we had blood orange bellini's which were delish! Overall, I was really happy with our meal, even if the host wasn't the nicest and the waiter was a big hoverer. I would go back! Note though, until the patio opens, the main dining area can get VERY warm, I was sweating throughout the meal, which was not the most attractive.
