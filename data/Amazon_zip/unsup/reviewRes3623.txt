For how easy and close it is, Crisp has made my "regulars" list. This is the THE place to get Korean style fried CHAAckkenn. I come here to rage on chick on the reg, its pretty chall. Thinking about it now, I'm going to go get a 6 piece. The bowls, burrito, and sandwich are ok but don't waste your time, get the fried chicken or go home.
