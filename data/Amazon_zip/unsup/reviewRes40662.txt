I recently went to 2/3 of the la pasaditas. Why there are three in the first place I have no idea. One of them only sells beef. You can get a pulled beef, chunky beef or beef tongue taco or burrito. What the heck? Tacos were alright but nothing to run home about. Green hot sauce is pretty good. The other la pasadita next door serves a larger variety of generic mexican food. The food was pretty good but the meat was not trimmed very well and I got a bunch of nasty chunks of fat in my enchilada. Free chips and salsa throw it another star.
