We did the 3-course prix fixe on New Year's Eve here and it was lovely. It was really nice, low-key ambience, polite and prompt service and a nice selection of choices to create a nice menu for two. Between my beau and I we ended up eating most of the selections, but really LOVED the Kentucky-fried pheasant in particular. We had two other guests with us who loved their meal as well. It was a good choice for NYE and the price was reasonable. Their bar was also a standout-- lots of very inventive drinks that were still very accessible. I would LOVE to return and take a large group....it was a lovely evening. One note though- there were at least four tables that had children. I'm not sure if this is unusual for this spot-- I certainly hope it is-- but it was a little aggravating. Keep your kids at home if you're doing a fine dining experience.
