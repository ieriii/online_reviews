Okay, okay, okay.................... True confessions here.....Last week we were staying at the Indigo Hotel, just a stone's throw from this place and my partner and I spent almost the whole day at this lovely venue. We started with a mid-afternoon drink/cup of soup/dessert, and we just.....stayed. Just like the two guys that were playing chess, or the elderly family of four who all had iPads to fiddle with, we stayed, it was comfortable there My husband and I hadn't seen each other for 3 days so we talked a bit and made plans. That night we were to take our son and his wife out for dinner, well, why not stay here and call them to join us? The menu is casual but very tasty. The beautiful homemade cracker that they start you with was unexpected, and soooooo herby and savory, I wanted to take some home with me. We had burgers, great salad and soup and my husband had their homemade key lime pie....twice! And kudos to their servers, thank you so much for letting us camp out at your restaurant, and never once making us feel rushed or over staying our welcome. I only hoped I tipped enough!
