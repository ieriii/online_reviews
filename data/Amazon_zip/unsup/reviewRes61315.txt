I won't bother going into detail about the delicious meats; there are already 200+ reviews on that. All I want to suggest is that if you go to Brazzaz, make a reservation and be prepared to wait. We went last Sunday night for dinner, got there at 6:20 (with no reservations), and were told we had about a 20-minute wait. Not bad at all, I thought. After waiting an hour, we asked them what the deal was, and why 8 couples that got there after us had been seated already. We were told they were doing the best they could to fit the walk-ins in with the parties that had reservations; the couples that had gone ahead of us all had reservations, yet they still had to wait. Since we were on top of the walk-ins list, we decided to stick it out.We were finally seated after an hour and a half wait, and by that time we were ready to go crazy on some meat. From this point forward, the experience was terrific!I happened to see a buddy there, who had a 7:30 reservation, and they weren't seated until a little after 8. He told me that's how it has always been for him there. Why you have to wait 40 minutes after your reservation time is beyond me. Even worse, why they would tell you there's a 20-minute wait when it's actually an hour and a half, is downright disrespectful.I will go back, as long as I have another coupon. I'll just be sure to make a reservation and expect to still have to wait.Don't get me wrong, this is a wonderful place to eat and I really enjoyed myself. I just wish going in, I had known the wait would be 4 times as long as advertised. So take my advice: if you're going for dinner, make a reservation; expect to be seated 30-40 minutes after your reservation; and don't forget your coupon!
