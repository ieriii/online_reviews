Stayed here in February for the Illinois Bar Exam. All in all, not a bad place! Pros: The food is great, the bathrooms (recently remodeled) were fabulous and the mini-bar is well stocked and the prices are not out of the ballpark. Plus, they are undergoing a remodel and they have really worked hard to accentuate their space. the building itself is not very large, with lots of twisty turny hallways, but they apportioned and accommodated it well. Also, the gym is really complete as far as hotel gyms go. Cons: It takes a bit for the staff to warm up to you. They are brusque and professional, but it seems like you have to talk to them for several minutes before they start to be nice as well. Also, it took the valet a long time to find my car. Finally, about the re-model, I'd have liked them to follow through a bit more . For a 4 star hotel, there were too many visible wallpaper seams and other such aesthetic issues showing.  BUT, I would gladly stay here again.
