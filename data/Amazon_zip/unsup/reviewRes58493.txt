Great food with the best service. I just came here for my birthday party last Saturday. As usual, they really really busy on Saturday but they still keep the best thing of their restaurant a quaint - sized restaurant with a heart of gold and love. There were nine of us and we had to wait for about 20 minutes. But you know what ?! The little lovely owner gave us many any COMPLIMENTARY appetizers and hot ginger teas for all of us. When we were waiting for tables. We were really surprised and kind of full before we got tables - not kidding what a sweet little owner !!! :-) Did you see any restaurant owner run around the restaurant even though he has more than 8 waiters and waitresses ? That's so funny. He breathed like he got heart attack but he still tried to make anybody happy and always has a smile on his face. Then, they gave us the fancy COMPLIMENTARY fried banana and ice-cream just because we had to wait for tables. Also, it's BYOB. How nice it is ! A BYOB with delicious foods at reasonable prices with wonderful service? That's Simply It or we can call them Simply Great     This was my second time. I've been here and we will definitely be back for more great experience.
