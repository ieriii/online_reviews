When my parents come to visit, food (not their adored daughter) often seems to be the main topic at hand. Craving Japanese food, and knowing that my dad is not a fan of sushi, I decided to make a preemptive strike and make reservations at the bar. The setup couldn't have been better, as I was suffering from food fatigue and couldn't face yet another sit-down dinner. My dad and I ordered the sake, my mom had a japanese beer (in a large bottle, so that I could also enjoy some sips, much to my delight). We ended up ordering appetizers, which were large enough that even my dad's stomach ended up being satisfied. I will definitely be back, if only to sample more of the cocktails, which looked very inventive, and different sushi rolls. The only dish that left me a bit underwhelmed were the phallic-looking beef lollipops-- I had envisioned something more like skewers, which would have looked nicer. Minus one star for the confusing restroom setup (down a flight of stairs without clearly marked doors).
