My husband and I had brunch here on Sunday. The food was delicious but the service was not great. Our waitress would disappear for long periods and things that should not take long (glass of orange juice, bill, etc.) took forever. But the food was so good, I am willing to give 4 stars. We started off with drinks -- me with a fresh squeezed glass of OJ (yum!) and husband with the Charleston Mule, which he enjoyed so much he had two! Then they brought out the delicious complimentary beignets. YUM YUM YUM! I love beignets, and these were perfect. For brunch, husband had the Blackened Chicken Cornbread Salad, which he enjoyed, and I had the Eggs New Orleans, which were truly delicious. I finished the entire plate...so good! I also want to mention that I love when brunch places take reservations. I hate the hassle of an hour wait when I am super hungry. I would go back here for the food and the fact that they take reservations, but I would expect it to be a long brunch based on the service.
