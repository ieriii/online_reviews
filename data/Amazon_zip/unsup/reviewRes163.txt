I don't know where to start. This is not my first molecular gastronomy experience, and I'm sure won't be my last. I can not wait to go back! The service was amazing, they really made sure we had a wonderful experience. They relaxed us right away and set the stage for a wonderful evening. I hesitate to go into great detail about the meal, as with molecular gastronomy experiences, the journey is a big part of the whole. Suffice to say, every single course they brought out left me wanting more simply because it tasted so good. The wine pairings were perfectly done and when I left, even though I was full, I wanted more. I do believe we will be back, during another season to see what they have to offer, say when it's truffle season again or some such :)
