The Violet Hour is unique. I could not bear to there very often but it can be alright once in a while. It's a great place to bring out of town visitors. I am not fan of waiting outside or in a dark hallway for hours. I know call me crazy. I really don't get why there is always such a long line of look-at-me's waiting outside a bar who's theme is not being seen. The drinks are really really good if you appreciate cocktail crafting. And anywhere they outlaw Grey Goose is fine by me.
