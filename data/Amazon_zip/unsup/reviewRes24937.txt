saturday late dinner, 9:30, 6 friends Oh Jose Garces, WTF? having dined at a couple of his philadelphia restaurants, I really had high expectations for Mercat. i would give this place ZERO stars if i could. in comparison to his philadelphia restaurants.. i could not believe Mercat was one of his. food - The food was just NOT tasty, not one dish wowed us; it was all very.. boring. it was the biggest disappointment.  octopus fritters - um... ok, not really. it tasted like straight up batter flash fried peppers - how is this on the menu? lifeless peppers with NO flavor, literally tasted like nothing paella negra - the taste of the ink overpowered every other flavor in this dish, reminded me of nyc chinatown, yuck. and everyone's teeth turned black. hot. brussels sprouts- id rather go to whole foods and buy a pound for $7.99 cauliflower- finally a unique and flavorful dish, but beware, it's gross once it gets cold.  scallop over short-ribs- it's mayor bloomberg level salty. oh my god i thought i was eating straight up salt. the scallops were over-cooked.. great pork belly - everyone in the industry is doing this.. how can it be so mediocre? step it up beef short-rib flatbread - eh.. red wine sangria - if watered down red punch is your thing.. go for it. service - in a huge space with high ceilings and chatter everywhere, not one person in our party heard our server say anything. and being a tapas place, you would think they would announce each dish as it is being served.. nope. i had to request every time for the name. and our sangria came out after our first couple dishes... um... ???? would i go back - hell effin NO!
