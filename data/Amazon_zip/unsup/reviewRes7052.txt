Went to q over the weekend for dinner with my husband and parents. It was a Sunday night and the place was pretty full. The restaurant did not look at all like I expected for a BBQ place. It was airy, somewhat open and elegant...a very nice atmosphere. We started with the onion rings, which were decent... not too greasy, with a touch of heat. They offer a BBQ flight that includes 3 different meats and sauces. We didn't try it, but will definitely get it the next time. We all ordered ribs. They have baby back and St. Louis...we all had St. Louis. The ribs are available "competition" style or regular style. The competition style costs more and is available on a limited basis and as a full slab only. The regular ribs are available in a full or half slab. We tried both and wouldn't say one is necessarily better than the other... they are just different. The competition style falls off the bone, whereas the regular style doesn't. The flavor was also a little different. I'd probably get the regular style again, as the extra cost of the competition didn't seem worth it to me.  The ribs came with 4 different sauces - regular, hot, vinegar and mustard. The hot isn't THAT hot, but does have a nice, comfortable heat that builds. The vinegar was good, as was the mustard. I didn't try the regular. The cornbread is BIG and yummy. We tried both the honey butter and the jalepeno cheddar.  The one disappointment of the meal was the baked beans side dish. The beans were way too sweet.   Overall, q is a solid addition to the seemingly ever-growing BBQ scene.
