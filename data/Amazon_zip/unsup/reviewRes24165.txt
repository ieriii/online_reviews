This is hands down my favorite/the best greek restaurant in Chicago. I love the lamb, and i'm pretty sure you will too. I prefer the butterflied lamb chops as my entree. I always take out of towners here and they love it. Many have had the lamb shank and give the same rave reviews. But you don't always get 5 stars just for food, this place also captures the ambiance. The service is phenomenal and you are treated like family. If you want to make it a casual night or a fancy night, you'll always feel comfortable at this place. There are no warnings to be had, come here often, come with friends, come with family, come hungry and leave happy! oh yeah, free valet parking so that's cool too.
