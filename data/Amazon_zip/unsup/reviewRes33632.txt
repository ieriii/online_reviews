A decent, long-standing Italian restaurant in the heart of Lakeview. First off, we were able to get in on a Friday night at 8pm - a rare occurrence (or just sheer luck). This was my second time here, the first being about 10 years back. The main dining room was crowded but we somehow managed to get a patio table, which was extremely quaint and allowed for decent conversation.  The menu was a hand-written, single sheet of paper, which I'm certain was run off on the Xerox machine that day (note: if they invested a little in nicer handwriting or even type it out on a computer, it would elevate the professional look). I ordered the frutta de mari, which came fairly quick and packed full of seafood. The sauce was labeled "spicy" but didn't have much of a kick. $16.95 for the entree and $5.00 for a dinner salad wasn't bad. (I've ordered similar dishes elsewhere and paid a lot more). The portions were large and the company was great. Waitstaff were attentive, initially. When we wanted to get the bill, however, it was a chore to track him down. Plenty of service staff around, so glasses were never empty and used tableware was quickly cleared.  Overall, I'd visit again. Good for larger groups as well. Reservations encouraged.
