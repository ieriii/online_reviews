Easily the best falafel sandwich I've had in Chicago, and it's huge. Plus tasty soups and a spinach pie that is crazy delicious. And everything is super cheap! Seating is extremely limited so either be patient, get your shit to go or eat your meal during the non-rush hours. It seems like a no-frills kind of place with chill employees. Cash Only!
