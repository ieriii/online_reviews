Yep, I'm wild about Wilde. Great location, cozy pub type atmosphere, good beers on tap and an extensive menu with traditional and new faves. What's not to like! On a Saturday night there was a 15 minute wait for our party of 4, but a quick beer with the friendly bartender and we were seated in a cozy booth towards the back. Writing this I can't wait to go back and try more of the menu items, but I can't recommend the mac & cheese enough. Definitely up there as one of my new favorites - the side portion is plenty for a dinner entree. Gooey, bacon cheesiness is perfect for a cold night. I added the green beans with tomatoes and cheese bits as an additional side but it was a pretty large portion. Great fries. Spicy buffalo chicken sandwich. Too much food and not enough room for dessert but the menu looked good. Love it and can't wait to come back.
