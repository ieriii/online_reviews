One of our go-to places in the neighborhood and arguably some of the best food in Roger's Park/ Edgewater-- so why 3 stars? 1. Since it is one of the few nice places to eat in this locale it draws a big crowd, long wait times, and lots of families with cheerio-flinging babies. Takes a long as 40 minutes to get seated some nights. Depending on the time, it's almost better to just eat in the bar area, which is infinitely more cozy. 2. They don't have a lot of imported alcohols. Locally sourced everything sounds great unless you're talking about wine, and the selection is a lot of junk from CA, which is frustrating. No Ketel vodka for the Bloody Marys either, although I will admit that their bloody mix is pretty tasty.  3. Food is usually hit-or-miss. Granted, there's a lot more hit than miss but, as far as brunch is concerned, I've not been impressed. Their breakfast enchiladas were great, but are no longer on the menu. The chilaquiles were pretty sad and the huevos uncommon was pretty disappointing. Their lunch and dinner menu features a lot more hits though, specifically the meatloaf, their burgers and mac-and-cheese are all fantastic versions of what could otherwise be lackluster staples. Here is where the locally sourced really shines. 4. The price. For a more casual restaurant in this neighborhood the prices are pretty unreasonable. Makes it hard for us to go regularly, which is a shame because I'm a fan of their dinner menu. I would say about 2.5 Dollar signs, 3 if you're a heavy drinker. You'd think all that local booze would be a bit cheaper.
