Cracks me up to read people's reviews about how hard it is to get a reservation, how loud the music is, theyre so mean to me on the phone and that makes me sad......it is what it is people (and most of thatt isnt true, besides the music. Its loud and its great). So dont post garbage negative reviews about it, especially if you dont even eat at the restaurant, Yih. Stay in California, no one cares. If you eat there and dont like the food, thats fine then. Post that. These are some of the coolest, most down to earth people you will ever meet. They treat you as you treat them. Plain and simple. Michael Carlson is a genius with food and the stuff he comes up with, possibly while youre sitting at the table, is amazing to see and taste. Its gourmet food on LSD, its a dining experience youll never forget and sometimes, if things go well, you wont remember either. People next to us drove on a whim from Upstate New York to eat there that night and you would never expect them based on appearance. But they were great people, knew everything about food, and they get Schwa. Thats why theyre there. So just go, roll with what happens and let the chefs do what they do. If you cant handle that exact plan, dont go. You wont enjoy it and youll whine about it on Yelp.
