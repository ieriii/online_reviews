I am happy we chose this place to have Sushi! Love the neighborhood, so clean and such nice people. This is a BYOB, so that was exciting and new to us! We had a few specials and the sashimi platter, then took everyone's advice and ordered the White Dragon Roll, it was AMAZING!!! The Rainbow Roll was very good as well! Its a tad dark in here but well worth the squinting :)
