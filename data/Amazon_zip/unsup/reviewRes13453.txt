Went with my aunt last week. We stumbled upon it as a happy accident. Everything we had was excellent and they were really accommodating with her dietary needs. The thing that I thought was great was how seasonal the menu was. We had a pizza that used pureed squash instead of tomato sauce and had brussels sprouts and I think some kind of syrup on it. It was very inventive and apropos. The sweet potato pancakes had a surprising Indian twist which was appreciated. The service was really great. Here's my thing. I thought the decor was a bit over the top and pretentious. It's not really a socialist brewery and restaurant...the theme was cute, but there was more than a nod in the decor which could make it too trendy for its own good down the road. I think they could tone it down a notch and keep it simple. Overall great experience though.
