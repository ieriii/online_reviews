I went there with my wife (who adores ethiopian food), and the experience was about average. The food was nothing spectacular, but definitely was worth the price, which was reasonable. The service was definitely lacking; although the server smiled, there were long delays, even though there weren't that many other patrons.  All in all, the vibe was good, so we'll go back and check it out again - I'll update the review at that time.
