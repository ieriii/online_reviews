This review is for the burger only. I want to first say, I am not bias--even though I am a naive chi-towner. But, this burger will make want to slap somebody (as, m mom use to say)!! Seriously good and hardy. You will not be disappointed with this diner experience. You can order a Vegan milk shake and some fries!! Truly the best thing going!!
