I don't want any other middle eastern after being here now over a dozen times. I absolutely love the Koubideh, Cornish Hen, Salmon Kabab & the Shirin Polo with Chicken here. Now when I go back I just want to knock down the rest of the menu. Service is great and the food always impresses. Forget Rezas or Andys. This is the PLACE!
