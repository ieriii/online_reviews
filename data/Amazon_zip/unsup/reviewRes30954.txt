Before, during, and after going pescatarian, The Chicago Diner is something that lingers on my mind and is a must-eat when I'm in the area. They have perfected cooking with meat substitutes and the vegan chocolate chip "milkshake", I don't even know how it's possible, is far better than any dairy milkshake I've ever experienced. If you're skeptical of meat substitutes, or if you're a vegetarian/vegan that just wants a break from the limited options most restaurants offer you, you should try this place. You don't have to worry about trying something new because everything is good.
