You really can't get better than this! One of my favorite restaurants in Chicago. Their bread is delicious, and the pasta is always good, especially if their homemade gnocci is on the menu. The only detraction from this place may be the fact that their tables seem to be too close together and give the feeling that you're packed in like sardines -- also makes the servers flub up more easily with water and drinks.
