Delicious food. Took forever. Hard to get water refills. Sides came after duck was almost gone. Had to share a melon ball sized scoop of sorbet b/w 2 people. No option to order more. Great tea. Excellent soft shell crab. Loud environment. Pricier than I was expecting for such a large group. (Due to eyes-bigger-than-stomach syndrome?) Last but not least: A homeless looking lady asked the duck-cutter something then walked off with one of the carcasses, much to the surprise of our table and the table next to us. She brought it to her table w/ 2 other just as scruffy looking folk (no offense here, really) and sat down. Several minutes later she graciously returned it. You realize they reuse these to make soup, to serve to you later, to...EAT. No dirty dreads in my soup, plz. EWWWWWWWW! WTF?!!
