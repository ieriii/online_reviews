Read a lot of reviews about how abusive the service could be, so fully prepared for that, and found ourselves quite surprised! The bouncer was super nice, and the waitress had unbelievable amount of patience for our indecisiveness on drinks! The bartender did look like he had been doing the same old job for maybe a decade too long. But then, we didn't sit at the bar, so no big deal. The music was entertaining. Didn't seem to be pure jazz that we expected. But we're not hard core jazz snobs, so were able to enjoy a fun-filled evening with some pretty strong concoction the grumpy bartender shake up. BTW, only credit card accepted was AMEX, which is quite unusual...
