this place is great. one star deduction for a. douche bag factor 2.the fact that the dining room always seems to have an hour and half wait even if it's lunch and there are 2 people visibly occupying space. that being said, they usually have available seating outside or in the bar area. this is hands down one of the best lunch spots available in the loop--try the 1/2 soup 1/2 sandwich. it comes with delicious french fries and is way more valuable than it's $13 ticket price (aka huge). the service here (both bar and table) has never disappointed and their beer list/cocktails are pretty vast. their house cured salmon app is better than the sandwich for some reason. i'd skip the venison tartar--lacking in flavor. pretty much anything else is a win. the chef here definitely means business and has my favorite name around--my guess is dirk flanigan is a ladies man, but that's purely speculative. swears.
