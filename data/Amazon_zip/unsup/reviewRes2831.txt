Of all of the restaurants that I have been to...this is the BEST dining experience I have EVER had. I went on my birthday....they had a special menu printed for me.....it was fabulous. The food was AMAZING...I agree...the caviar..TO...DIE...FOR!! And I am NOT a caviar fan. The ambiance is amazing...just an amazing dining experience all the way around. The chef had prepared a special dessert for me, with my name written in chocolate. The details were perfection. It is pricey but WELL worth the money.... Attention MEN.....Take your girls there.....you won't be disappointed!!
