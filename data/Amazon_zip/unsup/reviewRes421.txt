The high concept culinary experience that Alinea provides is almost indescribable. At first entry to the hidden, unmarked building, doors slide open and give diners the feeling that they are walking into the future. Chef Grant Achatz spent years at Napa's famous French Laundry and has elevated the level of innovative cooking at his Chicago eatery to that of pure science and elegance. Food is presented in the most creative ways (a slice of bacon on a wire, a potato and truffle on a pin) thanks to Crucial Detail Design Studio (http://www.crucialdetail). Service is impeccable, with waiters wearing fine suits and having superb knowledge of daily offerings. The twelve course tasting menu paired with their suggested wines adds to the whole dining experience and the Spanish Verdejo was the standout.
