I love the atmosphere here and their wine list is fantastic (and not too pricey!). I love to get flights of wine and cheese while I am here. I don't normally order entrees, but I do enjoy their appetizers or lighter food.  Last fall my bf and I went to a wine making class and we were able to mix wines to make a perfect blend. It was so much fun! We each got to make 4 blends and taste them all. They also had cheese and fruit and other snacks for us to taste the wine with. We ended up finding our perfect blend and naming it our Windy City Red with a picture of the skyline on the label. We bought a case and gave it away as Christmas gifts. I'm looking forward to that again this year! It was only $35/person (plus we got 10% off because we are in the club, and they gave us each a bottle of wine (priced at $20 per bottle) and all the food and tastings while we were there). What a deal!
