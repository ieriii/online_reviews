Good Italian food, parking across the street, never have to wait! I've been to Calo about five times now, and every meal has been great! Try the calamari with the spicy sauce! I recommend any of the pizzas or pastas. The wait staff is very attentive.  There was even a singer on the bar side singing Frank Sinatra songs throughout dinner which provided some nice ambiance during our meal.
