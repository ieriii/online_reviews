I'm not used to cold felafel, and Sultan's isn't very warm. It's also kinda' bland. On the other hand, it's incredibly cheap ($3 for a sandwich) and thoughtfully topped with hummus and salad. The schwarma leaves much to be desired. But again, at $4 for a sandwich, it's one of the better bargains in Wicker Park.
