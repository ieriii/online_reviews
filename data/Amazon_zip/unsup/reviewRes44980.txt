In a word: disgusting This pizza COULD have been good, IF they cooked the effing dough. Instead what I got was a pizza with a delightfully flaky outer edge, and a bottom that consisted of half cooked dough. Nothing is as tasty as gooey dough, yum. And it is "stuffed" because they put another thin layer of dough over the top. Then they put sauce on top of that. So guess what other part of the crust is not cooked at all? Bingo! That top layer was so disgusting. They at least put sauce on the pizza, unlike Lou Malnati's, but their sausage was not as good. I did not like their chopped salad as much as the Malnati salad either. So Chicago, THIS is your idea of good pizza? What a joke...
