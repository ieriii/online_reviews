i'm such a sucker for fancy breakfasts spots.... and i have been here on the weekends and waited...i LOVE to go when my schedule allows for a friday morning or thursday morning... no wait, awesome food... good coffee...  le sigh..... a few times i have been here, my friend i have have ordered something that looked delic to the both of us then split it and that works out really well and you don't feel like a huge pig! last time we did one of their special french toasts.. i believe it was an orange brulee kinda deal and we also go with the Gouda omlette that has avocado, bacon and gouda in it ( no tomatoes please.. they are evil) ....... sweet jesus .....it's a good place to eat. it's all good. *** UPDATE do not bring any vegans here, the one server who basically eye fucks everyone at the table was totally rude about the vegan options, and even asked him why he would be vegan... lame.. actually another server had to step in b/c she overheard and offered us *some choices..
