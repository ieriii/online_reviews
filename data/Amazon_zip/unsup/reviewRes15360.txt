Been a fan of this place for over 6 years and recently had an experience that Calo's needs to address. Upon delivery the delivery man asked for my credit card so they could imprint my card. BIG PROBLEM. In today's age I'm not about to allow some unknown delivery man to take my card number with him. Upon calling the restaurant got nothing but an excuse that it is up to the driver. Love their food but have many other options that that show more sensitivity to the protection of their customers. Sorry Calo's
