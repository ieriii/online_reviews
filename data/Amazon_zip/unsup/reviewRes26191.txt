I give Geja's 5 stars for a romantic experience and delicious food! It's not cheap, and I agree with one review that said the restaurant is like a maze and can feel a little cramped, but I've never experienced it being too loud or not private enough. I love coming here for a special Christmas dinner when all the twinkling lights are up. The live acoustic is great, it's very warm and cozy feeling, and since the fondue meal is in several parts which include cooking your meat, it makes for a long, slow, and beautifully relaxing evening. By the end of dinner I'm warm, full (but not stuffed) and very content. I would recommend coming here for special occasions and if you get on their mailing list there are plenty of coupons to help with the cost.
