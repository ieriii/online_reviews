I am not kidding...every single person that we encountered at this hotel that worked there from the front desk, to maintenance to housekeeping were so friendly and greeted us with a smile! That alone to me deserves 5 stars! I am all about great service and this hotel went above and beyond with it for sure! My hubby and I and another couple stayed here for a night on the town visit and we enjoyed our stay for sure! Our room was clean and well kept! The location is great. We usually take the El to the city, and its about a mile from the Clark/Lake blue line station...I suggest you just walk it! Right by the wonderful shopping on State street and the best part....GARRETTS POPCORN! They have a flippin' vent to blow out their delicious popcorn smells to lure you in...sneak sneaky..but it works!  The hotel has a decent sized pool...not sure if they have a whirlpool, we did not see one. The fitness center is nicely sized as well. The location is right by several restauarants and a short walk/cab ride to even more! Downstairs their is the Viand Restaurant/Bar and there is a Starbucks and a little market for juice, snacks, sodas, etc. If you want to be in a great location with excellent service then this is the hotel for you!
