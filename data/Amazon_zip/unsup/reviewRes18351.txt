I am always sold on freshly made pasta. I hate restaurants that boast to be Italian, but use box. The pasta here is damn good. Cute little hole in a wall, very small and tight corners. I love the decor, the sweet Elizabeth Taylor and Marilyn Monroe jacky paintings, which are for sale. My ma ordered lasagna, which was probably one of the best I tasted in a long fricking time. It's just drowning in a creamy rich tomato covering. I had papp noodles(which I love BIG slurpy noodles) with a creamy marscapone cheese sauce. I wish there was alittle more to the sauce then it's creamy-ness, but still good. The sizes were huge, so you will have some for another meal MOS DEF. Don't plan on rushing, this place likes to take it slow, so relax, crack open a bottle of wine and be selfish.
