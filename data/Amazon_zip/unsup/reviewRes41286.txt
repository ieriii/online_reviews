Maybe my experience wasn't as good because I expected more, but everytime I pass this place it's packed with people so I thought I'd give it a try.... however I was not impressed at all. I just ordered their #40 which is just normal traditional pho. This was not even close to being in my top 5 places for pho after this bowl. So the portions were huge, but the broth didn't really smell good. It smelled off, I don't know how to explain it, like I know the broth is usually pretty light, but this just didn't taste good, it barely tasted like anything.. everything was cooked fine aside from that. Oh my pho also wasn't hot enough. The meat took a while to cook, I had to mix it up and make sure it was pushed to the bottom for it to not be pink. So that's with the good, I'd go back to try the smoothies though. Now as for the service, the service SUCKED. HOLY CRAP, I had to find someone to figure out where I should sit and such, then had to ask for someone to take my order. My order took awhile, families that showed up after me got their order before me. Then when I was full, I asked a worker if I could have my pho packed (I only ate a little bit, like said- the portion was large and I wasn't thoroughly impressed so I planned on taking it home and adding things to it myself, college-budget style), after asking twice the lady came back with to-go containers... and then left it. So as I tried to pour the soup into the container, I made a huge mess and spilled it all over the table. The people that worked there just looked at me, kind of rudely actually; what did they expect? The bowl obviously wasn't good to pour out of, and they wanted me to do it, so I did! So that was that; and then I had to like hunt down the lady who took my order to get the bill... it was just so drawn out and kind of embarrassing and I did not enjoy my experience there at all.
