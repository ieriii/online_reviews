Bring someone who knows what they're doing. It will make this place a lot less intimidating. Trust me. I went w/ my roomie who is half Korean and she took the reigns on what to order, how to do it, and what the little bowl of white stuff was. Also, plan plenty of time to take a nap afterwards. After such a lethal (but delicious) dose of meat you and your gut will need the down time. There were 7 of us. Between us we split the beef, pork, chicken, and octopus. The chicken and octopus were a tad spicy for my weak white girl taste buds but the beef was to die for! I tell ya, it must have been marinated in heaven juice. My favorite sides were the pickled beets and the fish cakes (I think that's what they were called...flat pieces of fish stuff that looks almost like flattened tofu). Also. Leave your coat in the car, unless you want to walk around smelling like "cheeseburgers" as another friend we met up w/ later described us as. The staff was friendly and attentive even though the place was packed. I think they're used to battling the crowds though. Bring your appetites and bring your friends, try the soju! 36/52
