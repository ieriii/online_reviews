I ordered Coxinha, but they had run out. What restaurant runs out of an appetizer at 6pm? I got my pizza and the box was folded in half. It was soggy. I ordered the pineapple and bacon. It was supposed to only be Canadian bacon, but there was also bacon fat sprinkled on and under the cheese in chunks . I picked more than a tablespoon of fat chunks off one slice. I'm talking clear/white fat, no meat connected. I ordered 2 salads. There was old tough dark green romaine lettuce. There was lettuce that looked like it was on its last hours. The cucumbers were slimy and a little clear like they were pretty old. Probably won't order from here again.
