Recently ate at Schwa on a Thursday Night. Have been calling randomly here and there over the past few months and called one afternoon around noon and got a hold of somebody. The meal was amazing - one of the best dining experiences I have ever had. We ended up doing the 9 course ($115) which ended up being closer to 16 courses. The chef and their ideas are genius. They are very friendly and the place is very laid back. its BYOB - and bring some type of beer for the chefs, they will appreciate it and bring you more food! Will definitely be back sometime in the future. Some of the highlights were a chocolate Manhattan cherry amuse, quail egg ravioli, passion fruit roe, pigs face, pheasant, and salmon & pink lemonade.
