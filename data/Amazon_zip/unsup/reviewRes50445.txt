The food here was mediocre. It wasn't seasoned well. I got the catfish with eggs, tomatoes and toast for a brunch. The tomatoes would have been ok in the middle of winter but it was July. They were tasteless and hard. The catfish was the worst I've ever had. Very bland. Although I did try a bite of my friend's red eye eggs (not sure of the name but it was poached eggs over english muffins w a spicy hollandaise sauce and peppers and onions) and it was very good. And no one else complained about their food. Then when we went to check out we gave the server seven credit cards to split it up between and it took a very long time and we saw he had the manager and another server all helping him to do it. Maybe he was new. But someone who isn't new should have made sure we didn't have to wait so long when we were all ready to leave.
