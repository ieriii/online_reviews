One of the best authentic Italian restaurants in Chicago. When you walk in, it's like being thrown back to the early 80s. Had fettuccine mare chiara, comes with calamari, mussels, clams, & shrimp, UNBELIEVABLE, try dipping the bread in the sauce, makes your tongue wanna slap your brains out! Every entree comes with soup and salad, you will not leave hungry.
