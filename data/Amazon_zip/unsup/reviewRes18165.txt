WOW! Do they have a beer list or what!!! Came here to get a Half Acre beer on draft and was kind of dissapointed in their selection of Half Acre, but nonetheless they did have a variety of beers to choose from. Got the Allagash White since I've been wanting to try it and haven't had any luck find this beer in Indiana on draft. I really enjoyed the beer. I ordered their Reuben Burger along with fries. The burger was awesome!!!! Just wish this place had more of Half Acre's beer selection on draft!
