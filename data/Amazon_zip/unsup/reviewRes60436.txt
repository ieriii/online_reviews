Wonderful Italian in Andersonville. Worth getting out of downtown to go here and see one of the neighborhoods that really makes Chicago what it is.Really fresh food great variety of options. Not just a pasta mill -- although that's outstanding. Otherwise, really fresh, great variety of options of meats and seafood. Prices are quite reasonable given the high quality of ingredients, prep and presentation.Beautiful room, great patio out back when the weather cooperates.Has a big following, so reservations are a must if you can get one.
