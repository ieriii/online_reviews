My stay here this past Sunday and Monday night was o.k. Nothing special, but nothing totally awful either. The room was a decent size, the bed was great, but the toilet ran constantly and the bathroom had very few amenities. Once again, I was cursed with the room by the elevator (I'm 4-4) and while I'm on the subject, I think the elevator had a ghost as it would open & close 2-3 times EVERY ride (regardless of which car I was in) before going up/down. I'm not sure if I'd stay here again.
