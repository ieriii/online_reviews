New Year's Day brunch. Beer / fresh squeezed orange juice "mimosa's," seafood tower for two (inCREDible and well worth the money), frites with fried eggs and sausage. I could not imagine a better way to begin the new year. Seriously, it may all be a landslide after this meal (chilled lobster tail - WOW.) Add the most adorable wait-staff and I could not have asked for a better experience (and I am referencing the the boys that could make a lesbian reconsider!)
