I've only been to Hot Doug's once, but once is enough to give it 5 stars. If I were in the city more, I would go every time. Yes, the lines are long but the wait is worth it. I went with a group and we shared everything, and it was very good. Definitely a place you have to go to. Especially if you're only visiting Chicago.
