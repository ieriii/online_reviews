Spacca Napoli continues to be one of our favorite Chicago restaurants--wellworth the drive into the city and then some for one of their authenticNeapolitan style pizzas. Family night or date night, Spacca Napoli does notdisappoint. I just recently met the owner, Jonathan. What a delight! Heis as generous with his time and knowledge as he is with the freshingredients in his foods. This is a man who is doing what he loves andspreading the goodness to our hearts and stomachs. BTW, the staff is topnotch too. Go and order any pizza with the buffalo mozzarella, enjoy aglass of wine and don't be afraid to introduce yourself--you'll be glad youdid.
