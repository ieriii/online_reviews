Great place to grab a quick dinner or come in a for a snack of churros and hot chocolate. I can't speak for the dinner food, but the hot chocolate selection was pretty good and both tasty and authentic. The churros were a bit too coated in sugar, but they were good and seemed more authentic than normal street food fair. Atmosphere was nice too. Worth stopping in on any night! I'll be back.
