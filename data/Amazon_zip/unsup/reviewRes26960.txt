Even with GE being 71% fancy pants, I've never had a more comfortable dining experience. The music was basically pirated from my iPod, the ambiance was bright and refreshing, and despite this being an extremely popular restaurant, there was room to breath. The food was complex and witty but a little pricey for the portion. Luckily that left me room for a chocolate ganache desert which caused a distinct halt in all conversation. Flavor slide! Pork loin normally bores me to death, but the extravagant use of garnishes made me once again believe in the other white meat. GE is motivating met to work harder so I can afford the full experience tasting menu that looks reality shattering. BONUS POINTS: Apparently Graham noticed that I tweeted about my visit and sent over a pair of foie gras lollipops to reward my addiction to social networking!
