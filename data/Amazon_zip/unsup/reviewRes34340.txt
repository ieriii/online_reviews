Great cheap eats. Sometimes I just gotta have a flafel sandwich with loads of hot sauce, and Sultan's never disappoints. And God, that salad bar, love the stuffed grape leaves, artichoke hearts, brussel sprouts, olives, feta - it's too much! But I love it. Great hummus, great babaganoush. They even have Ting soda. We just went yesterday, and now I want it again.
