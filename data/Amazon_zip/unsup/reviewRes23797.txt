Greek Islands is just great. First of all, the service is so welcoming and competent. It's weird. Maybe its the Meditteranean old man thing, but I really felt like the host was happy to see me! We were shown promptly to our table even though it was a Friday at 7:00, and the last person in our party, who was a little late, was directed right to us. Our waiter was also helpful and attentive. Second, the food is delish. I got saganaki (the flaming cheese), avgolemeno (the chicken lemon soup), and gyros. Top notch. Tasty. Hot. Finally, the ambience is perfect for a Greek place. It feels like a real family restaurant, and it's light and airy but still cozy. Whether you just feel like Greek food, or want to introduce someone to it who's never tried it, Greek Islands is the perfect place.
