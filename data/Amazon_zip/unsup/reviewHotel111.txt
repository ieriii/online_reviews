Holiday Inn Express is an affordable good enough hotel. I found a deal online and booked this hotel for around $75 a night which is pretty cheap for downtown Chicago. The lobby and the common area are nice. The room is VERY small, but it has a comfortable bed. For me, when you're in downtown Chicago, you're not going to spend a lot of time in your room anyway. They have free wifi which is nice. Their free hot breakfast was also decent too. The rooms are nothing to brag about, but the location and price give this property a 4 star.
