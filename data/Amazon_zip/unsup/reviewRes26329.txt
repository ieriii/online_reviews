Simply It will always hold a special place in my heart! What a hidden gem! The food is delicious (some of the best Vietnamese food I've ever had) and very inexpensive. And even better, it is BYOB! What a steal! I have taken many people there who are visiting from out of town and they all love this place! It is a very small restaurant, great vibe, and the owner of the restaurant truly makes this place as special as it is! The owner of the restaurant is the best! Very personable and on more than own occasion has sent over free dessert for my friends and myself. (They thought I was VIP! :) Great way to impress friends!! My cool points went up! ) Recommendations: Summer Spring Rolls - fresh & delicious! Beef w/ asparagus! The food appears relatively healthy (no heavy sauces) and fresh with lots of veggies so it is a win-win in my book! Also, lots of options for vegetarians! DEF. WORTH A TRY! Satisfaction guaranteed!
