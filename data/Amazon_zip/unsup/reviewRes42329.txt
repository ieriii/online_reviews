Vegans... here's a pizza for you! We are big fans of the "Art's Vegetarian - STUFFED" with NO cheese. The kind folks at AOP don't even flinch when you order cheese-less, probably because they know the pie will come out just as tasty. The crust is awesome and the toppings nice and fresh. Very filling and there is even a gooey layer of dough near the top! Glad it doesn't have soy cheese either. Delivery and cost all reasonable. The pizza ordering experience exists even without dairy!
