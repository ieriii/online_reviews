This place is excellent. Beyond excellent. I came here with a party of 17. We hands down received the best service I have ever had in my life. And I am a serious service SNOB. I waitressed for a long time and I know all the excuses. You either know your stuff or are a lazy sack who doesn't deserve a job. This place was AMAZING. They handled the table extremely well. Because there were so many of us we did the chef's selection. They began preparing for us when we were in the lounge. Initially I was concerned that with such a large group I wouldn't be full after something like that. Boy, was it the opposite! Everything was perfect, the service, the amazing food, their timing. We even had a vegan girl with us. As soon as we told them, there were special vegan dishes coming out left and right. It was great! I honestly can't even think of enough good things to say about this place. It was excellent. I highly recommend it.
