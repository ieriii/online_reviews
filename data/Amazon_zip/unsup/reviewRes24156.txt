My wife and I went to this place for our first anniversary. Food in here is absolutely amazing. First of all when ever I go to Greek place i take lamb. They are just the masters in preparing good lamb. So last night we took something called Rack of Lamb. The meal is very pricey but worth of every penny. The best lamb I've ever had in a restaurant. Even thought, the food is amazing and deserves 5+, I just can't stand their waiters. They can't wait to kick you out as soon as you finish your dinner. Right after we were done with the meal a waiter came 3 times within 5 minutes asking us "do we want anything else or that's it". But at the end it is a great experience and I can't wait to go there again.
