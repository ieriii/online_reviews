I really had a two star experience, because I left hungry after spending $60, but I have to be fair, three out of four dishes were outstanding: roasted eggplant, mozzarella, pesto and tomato sauce in a little mason jar spread on lovely toast, and grilled romaine salad that tasted almost like toasted marshmallows if not for the anchovy, and the whitefish with fennel and grapefruit was so delicate and delicious. I told my husband when I ordered the pasta, "I bet it's one $10 single ravioli smothered in raw egg." He laughed and said, of "course there will be at least three, and they mix the egg with the ricotta." Guess who was right. Cut into it and a runny egg spilled forth. Ugh, someone else might like that, but I was grossed out and didn't touch it. I was really in the mood for great pasta, and from many of the reviews I gather too late that this is not their fort. Luckily, I was out with a handsome man, so nothing seemed too bad. The waiter was so cordial, fresh beer on tap, really beautiful rustic decor with awesome light fixtures and wine bottles everywhere (pretty romantic, too, in a low-key hipster way), kind of weird, loud music. Small plates are always regrettable to me, because they seemed to get finished just as I'm really starting to revel in the dish, or they aren't very good and cost a lot. I had a bit of both of this here, and probably wouldn't hurry back. When I get Italian food, personally, I like to leave with leftovers and an extra inch on my waistline.  But if you like tapas and Italian food, you will love this place.
