This place was so much fun!!!! Our server was very helpful, really taking time to explain menu options and make recommendations. The decor was great. I loved the intimate table settings. Our Saturday entertainment included Flamenco guitar, which was probably not necessary, but nice nonetheless. The staff offered to us on numerous occasions to bring us extra vegetables and potatoes if we finished what we had, but alas, we were too full!! The meals highlights were the cheese fondue with grapes and the frangelico cappuccino - very much worth the extra $$.
