Truthfully, I'm not someone who gets all excited about sandwiches. So when my best buddy raved about this place, I was like 'Eh, ok, let's go."  My reaction? Mmmm, (smack lips), Mmmm mm mmm. This place ROCKS! Bless the creators of this tasty sandwich. I ordered the Bistec sandwich off of the lunch menu, but for dinner. (yep you can order dinner off of the lunch menu). Super cheap - under 6 bucks. This is one of those sandwiches that makes you crave for more. The steak cuts were juicy, warm and tender. Topped with refreshing romaine lettuce, tomato, grilled onions,and shoestring potatoes. Everything is fresh! Atmosphere-wise, don't expect much - it's definitely just a small tiny cafe, might be better for takeout & super casual. I'd heard the Armitage location might have bigger seating but i think this Clybourn location is the original one. So if it's good cuban yummies you're looking for, you've come to the right place!!
