All time favorite grocery store. Selection is fab, staff is well informed, and the store is impeccably clean. The only downside is it is very pricey. Extra perks: -Free valet (for those cold winter nights). -An outdoor patio- excellent on Sunday morning brunches! -Samples -Special cooking class events
