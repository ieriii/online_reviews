What to say, what to say... Mac & Cheese. This isn't your standard Mac & Cheese ladies and gentlemen... it is a bite of gooey, cheesy, crunchy, flavor loaded heaven in your mouth. YUM! Add a couple 007 martini's with blue cheese stuffed olives and a beet salad with warmed goat cheese and grilled shrimp and you've got yourself a happy tummy. They don't have buzzers... somehow they remember who you are and come find you when your table is ready. We schmoozed some guys sitting at a bar and got their seats while we waited which was lucky. Pretty relaxed setting. Nice people. Pricey. Probably wouldn't go back unless I was craving some mac and cheese. (i mean seriously this stuff is bobby flay throw down worthy)
