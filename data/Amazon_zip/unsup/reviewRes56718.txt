What a lovely evening we had tonight! My husband and I went here for our anniversary and could not have been more pleased. We came into the restaurant to personalized menus for the occasion. Carlo seated us in a private candlelit room which was really romantic. Our waiter was knowledgeable and very attentive. The caprese salad was delish, but our entrees were to die for. I had the pumpkin ravioli and my husband had the pesto gnoci. The pumpkin ravioli hands down in the tastiest thing I have ordered out all year. We shared a bottle of wine and just enjoyed the experience. To top the evening off, our waiter gave us glasses of champange and dessert on the house. We will definitely be back.
