I have wanted to eat some good Pan Asian food in Chicago since moving from SF and this places has it. I was not sure what to expect since I know the staff on the phone aren't the friendliest. I was happy with our waitress Kelly P. The food was really delicious and I thought that the portions were perfect. My husband and I left pleasantly surprised how low our bill was for the amount of food we had. The Tales of Two Tunas is my favorite sushi roll there so far! Will definitely go back to try some other dishes. Trust me book in advance and don't let the service scare you off since the food is worth it.
