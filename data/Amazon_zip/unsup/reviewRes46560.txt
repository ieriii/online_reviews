I can't say enough good things about this place! Fun atmosphere, great service, FABULOUS food. The menu was fun to read. The salad bar was upscale. The price is right. The neighborhood is cool. It's the complete package! On top of it all, our server happened to ask if it was our first time at the restaurant, and apparently when we said it was he went back and told one of the managers to hook us up. When the manager came to deliver our check, he also brought us an ice cream sundae with a warm cookie and hot fudge sauce, on the house! Words cannot describe how good that cookie was. I heart RJ Grunts.
