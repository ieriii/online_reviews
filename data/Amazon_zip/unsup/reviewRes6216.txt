Simply delightful. The food was delicious, the wine was affordable, the service was attentive, and overall, the value cannot be beat. Went with a party of 4 on a Saturday night at 6:30. You have to be willing to wait if you go for dinner (we were quoted a wait of 90 minutes to 2 hours and were seated in an 2 hours and 15 minutes), but the long wait is well worth it. Our server was friendly and attentive, as well the 2-3 other servers/bussers who helped our table. The honeycomb and ricotta with toast was perfect - creamy but surprisingly light and sweet. The mascarpone polenta with ragu of the day was my favorite dish - the smoothest, richest polenta I've ever had and the sauce and veal meatballs were hearty and tasty. We also had the truffle egg toast, risotto carbonara, pizza de la fattoria, beets and pork belly and all were wonderful. We also had two bottles of wine. All of the above, including corkage fee surprisingly totaled $122. We were all stunned. I thought with the typical long waits at Davanti would make it the kind of place I'd go once and never return, regardless of the food quality. But now, I'm dying to go back. I'll brave lines, I'll go in at 10pm. I'll do whatever it takes to get there on a regular basis and taste the rest of the big, delicious menu!
