Pound for pound, dollar for dollar, my favorite place to eat in Chicago. It never disappoints. Go early. Try to go during the week. Yes, the wait in line is worth it--if you get sausages. I recommend not getting a regular hot dog and going for the sausages. (For regular Chicago hot dogs, hit up Superdawg.) The foie gras and duck sausage is my all-time favorite--absurdly delicious and decadent. I also like the rattlesnake and the spicy thai chicken sausages. The infamous duck fat fries are really good, but perhaps a tad overrated and hyped-up.
