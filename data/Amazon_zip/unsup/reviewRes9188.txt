I brought my spouse and in-laws here for dinner on a Friday night. The reviews made it out to seem like an interesting place to try. To say the least, I was underwhelmed. The atmosphere was really relaxed and romantic. The service was great. The food was underwhelming. I've had better Vietnamese food in the city.
