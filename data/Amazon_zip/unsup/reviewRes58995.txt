My friend and I ordered a few specialty rolls (Firecracker, Number Nine, Lobster and Pig roll that had bacon on it) and an appetizer (a tuna avocado salad) and loved everything we ordered. It is pricey but we both were raving about how delicious everything was. I have already booked my next reservation.
