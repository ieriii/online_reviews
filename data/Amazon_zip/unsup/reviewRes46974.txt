This place has interesting decor, great service and food combinations that are intriguing to the American palette. However, I'm really disappointed in the portion size. It's really enough to piss me off. I enjoyed the sweet potato croquettes. I thought my roasted chicken with cauliflower puree and bacon (and parsnips...how autumnal) was great! But it was small. I just paid $20+ for a dish that, yes, was skillfully prepared, but I left feeling hungry. I think they could have just made the portions bigger or just adjusted the price. My entree was not worth $27 (with tax and 20% tip--I had great service, as I mentioned). It was a glorified chicken breast with potatoes. I mean, it was a delicious chicken breast and I usually do not like meat that much. But, it was chicken. It wasn't a steak. They could have at least given me more cauliflower mash...that's cheap, right? I need more convincing reasons to go back or my wallet and stomach will be empty (Oh God...did I just sound like a Subway commercial? I think I did. You get the idea).
