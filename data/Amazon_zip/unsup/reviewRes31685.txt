The food was good (try the spinach and articoke dip, yum!) and the service was friendly, but they didn't have the beer that was on the menu, which sucked a little, but ohh well. The place was to dark for my taste, I guess if I had been on a date instead of a friend dinner it would have swayed my dislike, but it wasn't a date, so it was dark. I heard from a friend that the pastries and desserts look amazing but actually do not taste as good, so I didn't try. The place was a tad pricey for me, but not too bad.
