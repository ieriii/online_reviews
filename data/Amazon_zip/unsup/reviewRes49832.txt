Best skirt steak (Entrana) I've ever had (so far.) Try the appetizer for 2 of the grilled calamari/shrimp on a bed of salad...it's so perfectly grilled and delicious! The portion is very good so we did not even order 2 entrees. We order a full entree of the skirt steak, 1 order of empanada (2pcs), appetizer for 2 of the grilled calamari/shrimp, 1 glass sangria and coffee. For 2 of us, it was perfect, because we get to try a little bit of everything in 1 visit. Everything we ordered were superb down to the coffee. Each cup was brewed to order. Great service and value for the price you pay! PS: If you have a GROUPON, make sure you make a reservation before you go, they will not take you if you don't make one..it says it on a sign on the front door!
