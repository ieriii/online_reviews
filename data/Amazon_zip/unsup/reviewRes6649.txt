Food here is wonderfully flavorful, fresh, and innovative. BUT the myth of "retail wine pricing" or even more recklessly foolish "at cost" needs to be explored, exposed, and debunked. The listed prices are consistently MUCH higher than any self-respecting retailer could charge And then the restaurant cleverly perpetuates the myth by adding a "corkage" fee. The net price for most bottles of wine is not that different from the pricing you might see at many a trattoria. Granted, the wines are diverse, well selected and mostly high-quality regional Italians from non-corporatized/branded importers. Outside of the odd selection of Veuve Cliquot (sic--the most misspelled name on wine lists everywhere!) at $88 PLUS "corkage" there are many gems. The excellent food is the draw.
