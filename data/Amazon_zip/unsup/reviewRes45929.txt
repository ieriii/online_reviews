I'm always slightly suspect at a menu that takes ages to read coz it has too many options on there! This all american place has large portion sizes and a conveyor belt feel to it, where quantity is probably just beating the quality. It's also loud and very large with many many tbales... none of this should necessarily mean it's a bad place, lots of people clearly enjoy this kind of atmosphere. It's not cheap but it is cheerful...
