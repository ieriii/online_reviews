Yeah, when it comes to great Chicago neighborhood restaurants, it doesn't get much better than Sabatino's. Recently returned with friends for the first time in years, and was very pleased to find it packed on a Friday night. The decor - which can only be described as "Italian Kitsch" -totally works. After stuffing ourselves silly with pizza bread (they happily brought us a second round), I had lasagna - the portion size was incredible, and taste was fabulous. Entrees come with soup and salad... Save room for dessert - we barely had any!
