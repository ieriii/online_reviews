Great carne Asada. I've been here before but the last time I ate here there was hair in my burrito. I can deal with one hair, I can even deal with three but I just kept pulling hairs out, I asked for a new one, ate it and never going here again. You probably will go because it's famous, maybe I was in the wrong place at the wrong time.......
