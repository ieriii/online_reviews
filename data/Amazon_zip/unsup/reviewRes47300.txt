We came here for a friend's birthday... Very busy for a tuesday but they had half price burgers so that made sense. The burger was fabulous! I posted a picture so you could see it in all it's glory! Beer selection is large! Lots on tap too. The only things I didn't like was the volume of the music... very hard to have a conversation and the wait to get a table... Because there were so many people it felt like we were standing on top of someone's table! Over all... I will be back!
