The food was delicious! My boyfriend and I had: their "Chicago fave" Pepito sandwich Patacones Oatmeal shake with milk The food was exceptional. Everything was made to order and came out pretty fast. When we fiirst got there, we were served water and tortilla chips; our waiter was very friendly and quite attentive. My only regret about this place was that the plate the patacones came on had grease/oil from the fryer... But they were still edible!:) Basically, this place is very authentic! The prices, quality and quantity of food, ambiance and service were ALL great! We will definitely be going back to this awesome spot! Words of advice: ONLY cash is accepted at the place and the sitting area up front is less crowded/more ample.
