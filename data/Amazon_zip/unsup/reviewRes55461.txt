Awesome patio. We had to wait an extra 40 minutes to be outside. I never saw the space when it was called thyme but the inside looked great.Big antipasti spread welcomes you as you pass through the well lit dining room. We had the Porchetta which is a roasted pork belly ( I think). moist and delicious.the dessert was also awesome. It was made with caramelized pineapple and some kind of gelato on top. I would definitely recommend this place, unless you are looking for chicken vesuvio, veal scaloppini and garlicky deep red marinara sauce. Nothing wrong with that stuff, those are staples of every other Italian restaurant in north America. this feels more like the places I ate when I went to college in Rome.
