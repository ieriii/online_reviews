24 side dishes of banchan, seafood pancake, octopus, galbi bbq + Soju = DEEELIIICIOUS! As soon as we ordered, all the food just started to come all at once. We drove all the way from Cleveland for the weekend for St Patty's and heard this place was good. Didn't think that the food would come out so soon. We were hungry so we weren't complaining. The food was good but kind of on the greasy side but I guess that's what you expect from eating Korean BBQ. The seafood pancake had the mussels, shrimp as what they described. It was fluffy but yet so good. The octopus was just too chewy and maybe we shouldn't have grilled it but how were we supposed to eat it? All the banchan dishes were all too good and more you can ask for. The galbi was the best because it's all marinated so after you grill it, you can still taste the flavor. The only thing I was a bit bummed about was that they didn't have ddukbokki. Spicy rice cakes is like a classic dish you have to have and this place did not. The service was acceptable and it was a friday night so it wasn't really that busy either. I called ahead to see if i needed to make reservations and the lady said they only took it for 10+ people. When we first walked in, we were seated right away, so no complaints there. Decor: Traditional Korean tables or regular wood booths. I wish we could have sat in one of those.
