My friends and I ate here after attending Eric Clapton's Crossroads Guitar Festival at Toyota Field. It was a recommendation from a friend that eats here a lot. We arrived late morning due to our late night of hanging out on Rush Street eating at Gibsons Bar and Steak House. we were told it would be busy and we'd have to wait for a table. Yes, it was busy alright. We waited for about 1 hour. The buzz of the dining area full of noise and activity. We were seated in a roomy booth with a large table. The waitress was busy running around, but came to us within seconds of being seated. I like the fast service. We ordered our drinks, but had to ask her to come back since we had never been there before and had to look over the menu. I ordered orange juice and coffee for the morning pick me up. Our drinks were delivered quickly. I was surprised that the service was so good, even though it was so busy. Even my friend Lina who works as a waitress was impressed by the service, and she is hard to please. I ordered a Denver omelet, hash browns and fruit with a side of biscuits and gravy. My taste buds and belly were definitely satisfied. My next trip to Chicago will include a visit to Yolk.
