Please return my baby. Please return my baby. Chili's baby back ribs. Is that how the song goes? Sorry, I was only 6 when that ad campaign was popular, so I don't remember it well. Who would have thought that ribs would steal the show at an Italian restaurant? I know you probably don't believe this about me, but I'm not that big on ribs. But that all changed last night. I am now a total ribhead. I look forward to lunchtime so I can go to McDonald's and get a McRib. Hopefully the McRib, which I only vaguely remember from my childhood, is braised in milk and honey and then browned with carrots and chanterelles. Okay, enough about McDonald's. We split the ribs as an appetizer, so guess what I got for a main course... No, not the pumpkin ravioli that everyone seems to mention in the reviews. Actually, no one at the table was willing to step up to the plate and order that, which totally pissed me off, but once I got my entree, my anger subsided and I stopped beating my head against the table. Give up? I got the lobster ravioli!!!111one It was totally wicked. 5 big raviolis, slightly sweet, with a discernible lobster flavor in a delicious tomato-based sauce. What's super creepy though, is after I got home, Throwdown was on, and Bobby Flay had to take on these two ravioli masters. Flay wins. Spoiler alert. We had some above average tiramisu for dessert. I still haven't found another restaurant that serves the same style of tiramisu that Caro Mio does, but Sapori's was delicious enough to keep me from crying. Service was great. Our waiter was totally cool, and not completely annoyed with us, which is a rarity when dealing with my sister and brother-in-law.
