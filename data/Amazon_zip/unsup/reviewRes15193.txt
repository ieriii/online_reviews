Went to enjoy some beers the other day. We got there mid afternoon and it was not very busy. I think the beers are good and am looking forward to when they start selling in other forms than growlers to take home.  I have not tried the food yet - but the person sitting next to me had the bacon popcorn and it smelled awesome.  I will probably avoid here when there is a long wait.
