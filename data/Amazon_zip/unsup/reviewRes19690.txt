Went to Coast for the first time with my BFF. We had a reservation and got seated right away on a Wednesday night after finding street parking (free) not far down the street from the restaurant. Our server immediately brought us a wine bucket with ice for BYOB bottle of wine and opened the bottled for us. There is no corkage fee. The BYOB is great but limited to one bottle of wine/booze/six pack per two people. Generally not a problem, but just an FYI. We ordered edamame which came very quickly after we ordered it. We then had the white dragon roll (delicious!) and the volcano (also tasty). The food seemed very fresh. My only issue was the size of the rolls...kind of lacking. I have been to a lot of other sushi places that have rolls priced the same as Coast but have rolls that are much "fuller." Overall the quality of good was great so I'll be back again, but just be prepared to order another roll if you're hungry.
