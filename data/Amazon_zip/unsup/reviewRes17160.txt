Years ago, when I lived in a place a lot less cool than Chicago, a good friend and I would go out to less than desirable bars. At some point we'd begin fantasizing about the bar we would open, listing off the things that we would ban and encourage (white baseball caps - OUT, good music that's not too loud - IN). We jokingly named it "Actually Fun." Now I find myself, ten years later, discovering that Actually Fun has come true in the form of the amazing Violet Hour. I must confess. I love this place and frankly, am a little jealous that I didn't think to open it myself. Yes, the drinks are slow, yes the wait can be long, but actually, I think this helps the entire mood of the Violet Hour. Don't like the wait? I don't want to be sat next to someone impatient anyway. Don't like the cell phone ban? No one really wants to hear your private conversation. This is not a place to come and get drunk and be obnoxious (which has its place of course!). The creative cocktail list should let you know that the drinks here are mini works of art, meant to be savored and appreciated, not slammed back. I love the fact that each time I've been here I've just randomly selected a drink and it's been fantastic. The dark and cozy atmosphere I have found works for celebrations, romantic dates, or long talks, because it sets a nice party vibe, while still allowing one to hear conversation. Dear Violet Hour, I love you, and if your owners ever want to open a second branch I'll be glad to help!
