The ambiance is great for a date and there are a lot of interesting things on the menu. The waitstaff was also very attentive. I wanted to order the risotto, but then my date ordered it, so (without too many vegetarian options) I ended up going with the spaghetti with fennel. While my date was satisfied with the risotto, I found the spaghetti a bit bland. There was a great wine selection and the bread was really delicious. I would go back, but I wouldn't say it's one of my top places.
