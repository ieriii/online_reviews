Great meal. We did the $68 chef's choice menu and enjoyed it. Despite some comments we felt like it was a ton of food. Service was spot-on. I am not usually a tapas fan, but this place made me happy. I didn't pay the bill so that might have changed my views. But, I am sure to be back at some point for a cocktail or two and a nibble on a couple of tapas.
