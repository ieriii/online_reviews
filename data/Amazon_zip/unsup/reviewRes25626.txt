I had never eaten at a fondue restaurant, I was ready for anything. Firstly, it's very dark inside with an orangey-red light. That was unexpected. They do cram a lot into a small space, making the dining area something of a maze. Room dividers are shelves of empty wine bottles, which is pretty cool. Our service was excellent, no complaints there! My girlfriend and I ordered the cheese & chocolate 3-course meal and split it. Having already eaten a pretty heavy lunch, this was more than enough food. The salad was good and the cheese fondue was excellent; the bread and veggies were too big to dip and eat so we had to cut them ourselves - food here is labor-intensive! I'd say, at least for this course, the work was worth it. We were expecting the chocolate fondue to be like melted Hersheys chocolate chips. What we got instead was more like Herseys chocolate syrup - good...but not as good as it could have been. If i wanted to dip stuff into chocolate syrup, I could do it at home for $5. The fresh fruit, berries and marshmallows were great and the pound cake was good, but I wish that the chocolate could have been melted rather than syrup. They have a fantastic gift certificate program and I'm looking forward to returning! The fruit alone would be a great dessert.
