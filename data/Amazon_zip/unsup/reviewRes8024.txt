Stopped by with a group of co-workers today for a little dream of a lunch on the northside. Well, maybe not so 'little' as we ordered up the following pizzas: Salsiccia: Mozzarella, Basil, ltalian Sausage, and traditional red sauce Prosciutto e Rucola: Provola, prosciutto di parma, arugula, parmesan, and olive oil Bianco Nero: Pecorino with black truffle, fior di latte mozzarella, porcini mushrooms, white truffle oil, and olive oil Sorrentina: Pomodorini, Mozzarella di bufala, basil and olive oil Additionally, we tried the fried goat cheese special and the four cheese pizza with spinach special... magnifico! Really, everything was great though my favorites were the double truffle and the prosciutto topped with arugula pizzas. Charming, bistro-esque atmosphere and knowledgeable service. Didn't hurt that our server was clearly Italian and handsome to boot! Can't wait to return for some more authentic Neapolitan pizza! Spacca Napoli has it down pat.
