More like 3.5, but I'm rounding up because I love me a delicious brunch spot.  Vegetarian breakfast burrito was delicious. Give me more! Spinach and red pepper eggs benedict was okay. They should've cooked the spinach a little bit more, but the hollandaise sauce was good. The potatoes that came with the eggs benedict were drool worthy. I love potatoes! Red velvet pancake was impressive and not just because it was red velvet. The pancake consistency is the best I've had (that I can remember). I don't normally enjoy pancakes from breakfast places because they're just okay, but this pancake was amazing. The texture and consistency was ridiculous. I can't even comment on how legit tasting the red velvet flavor was because I was so impressed by the pancake consistency. We actually got another pancake dish per our server's recommendation, but it was not memorable compared to the deliciousness of the red velvent pancake. When you're ordering, keep in mind that the portions are large and in charge, esp. the pancakes. We could've done without the 2nd pancake order.
