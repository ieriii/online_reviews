I could see how The Purple Pig would be really beautiful in the summer but I digress. Upon entrance The Purple Pig is equal parts cozy and cute with large wooden wine barrels that serve as decor, spanish style tiles on the wall with an overall "chestnuts roasting by the fireplace" feel.  Service was quick and attentive. Wine glasses are sparkly and large, practically begging you to order one. On to the food.... When the food first arrived my first thought was, OMG, I am going to leave this place hungry....the portion just aren't huge. But after splitting each one, I realized I was getting quite full. Each dish I had was amazing and I was skeptical b/c some of them sounded interesting and sometimes that can lead you down the wrong path but these were killer: Eggplant parmesan balls (OMG soooo good) Meatball slider with parmesan, arugula on brioche (soooo delicious) Chicken thigh kabobs with fried smashed potatos and tzatziki (sooooo good) Some sweet potato appetizer with sunflower seeds (sounds weird but tasted delicious). Truly impressed with each thing that came out. Didn't even end up making it to dessert.
