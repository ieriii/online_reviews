May I first say how awesome it is to have a new bar/restaurant practically across the street from my place. The icing is that it's an awesome bar/restaurant. My neighbors and I decided to check the place out a couple days ago for drinks. We had no idea what to expect but were delighted when we saw the extensive, affordable beer list. The entertainment, first some Incubus then some old school G&R. At first I thought it was a little loud but as the drinks went down, it was just fun! Today I brought my boyfriend there so we could try the food. After previously viewing the menu and appreciating his love of a good burger, I was hopeful. He ordered the Big House, I ordered the Ponzi Scheme and we split an order of the Mac&Cheese. Both of us were far from disappointed. The burgers were cooked to perfection, the combination of topping was quite tasty and the fries were fresh. Not to mention that the mac & cheese was better that any attempt we've made. While we have previously come to terms with having to wait up to three hours for a comparable burger, now we just have to walk across the street. Thank you P.J!
