Went here for mother's day lunch and the waiter so kindly gave each lady a rose. How sweet! We sat in the back and it was pretty empty in there though. I think we were early. I had a steak. It was good. Not sure if it my favorite steak place though. I have been here twice and it was somewhat memorable.
