I was very impressed with Tank Noodle. Their menu is large and (from what i know) pretty authentic.  The food is a good price and came quick.  There is one price for the Pho on the menu, but you can get a larger bowl if you ask. The food comes very fast, so this is a great place to go if you are very hungry! I need to go back, because there are a lot of things that i want to try, but i was already in a food coma when i left the first time. oh- and try the shrimp spring rolls. Tasty!!
