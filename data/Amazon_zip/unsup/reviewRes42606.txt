Pretty good! My best friend and I ordered a medium thin crust pizza with green peppers, tomatoes and sausage. Very tasty. Its a good lunch spot. Nothing really 'sexy' about eating here but its just plain good pizza with fountain or can drinks. Also, when you see cops come in to eat at a place I somehow assume the food it good.
