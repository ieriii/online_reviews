A decent location that I managed to book for a cheap price (~$110 per night). We checked in early, which the concierge was ok with it. We had some glitches with getting our room (from broken door to non-functional heating), but the staff was professional about it that we ended up in a room on the 15th floor with 2 king-sized beds (when we started with a 3rd floor room with 2 queen-sized beds). The hotel is under some renovation, so there were plastic sheets on the ground of every floor. It wasn't a big deal to me. Overall, for the price and the location, I was quite satisfied with the quality of the room and the staff. Would definitely consider this hotel again when I visit Chicago next.
