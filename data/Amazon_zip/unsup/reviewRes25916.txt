I don't know if I just had to high of expectations or what, but this was just a very trendy place with trendy food that wasn't anything special. Its possible that I didn't order correctly, but I wasn't blown away by anything. We didn't want to eat much before going out, so we just ordered a few small plates to split...service was outstanding though.
