Amazing food - outstanding beer. I had the Beluga Lentils and a cheese soup. Freaking amazing! Everyone else enjoyed their food except the beet salad seemed pretty light on beets (the burgers had more beet on them). Brought home a growler of Eugine porter. The wit is like the best Blue Moon you've ever tasted. This would have been a 5-star review if only they knew how to make a margarita too. Hey Revolution, I can't hang out there if my girlfriend doesn't have something to drink too. Put some booze in it!
