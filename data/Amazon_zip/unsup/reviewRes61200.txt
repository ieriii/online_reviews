We were visiting Chicago and decided to test famous Chicago pizza. Everything was fine, good pizza, good time. However, my wife left her sun glasses on the table and when we come back to table - there were no glasses. We asked the waiter -and the answer was he did not see anything. The waiter asked other personal and after some checking the answer was still negative.  I checked myself with the people who were seated at our table and they told me that they gave the glasses to the waiter, which we already asked. After short conversation and initially telling that nobody gave him any glasses, he finally pointed out on the pace where he placed them previously.This is my story about Gino's Pizza.  Pizza is good but .......but bad feeling is still exist.
