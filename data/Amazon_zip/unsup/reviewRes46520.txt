I really enjoy going to RJ Grunts after a stroll through the Lincoln Park Zoo and Conservatory. The have a great soup/salad bar that is a must for any newcomer. I happened to go on their 40th anniversary and this place was a madhouse. Seating took a bit but it is usually quite quick. Burgers were $1.5 (any burger). The chocolate malts are yummy and should be shared. The homemade potato chips are super. Not too greasy, not too dry. A Carafe of water is on every table. Servers check on you frequently even when they are super busy. I am a fan and will definitely be back. Bike parking on street.
