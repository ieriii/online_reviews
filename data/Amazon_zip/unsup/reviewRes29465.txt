If I could eat here every day I would totally become a vegan. I went here for the first time last night and it was very much worth the 25 min wait on a Friday night. I had the BBQ "bacon" cheezeburger with mac and cheese and my friend had the Gyro with the sweet potato fries. Everything was so good. Then I ordered a peanut butter and chocolate shake to go. I definitely plan on coming back to eat and try new menu items sometime this week. Prices are also very reasonable. Very impressed I also recommend trying the "chicken" pesto. so yummy.
