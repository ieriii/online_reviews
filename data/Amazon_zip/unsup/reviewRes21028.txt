Tortas. Tortas. Y mas tortas. I was stoked to check this place out. I watched the people line up to order something from this menu. I ordered the gunthrop chicken torta. My partner in crime ordered the ahogada torta and a order of guac and chips. Hmmmm...so 4 bucks for guac is a bit crazy for me since it looked like it was a scoop of ice cream. My torta wasn't as good as I expected it to taste. Anywho...Ricky you come up with great concepts to sell the Mexican sandwich. Great job. I will return to try some of the sweets.
