This is by far one of the nicest dinners I have had in Chicago in the past 8 years. We decided to go here for my wife's birthday at the recommendation of a good friend. We arrived at our reservation time and I was surprisingly greeted by the Chef who said "you must be Jason."  He offered us a choice of seats and asked if we liked a little adventure. We said "of course" and he said "we are not going to give you a menu, just let us cook for you tonight". I said yes and my pocket book said no, but we dove in.  The chef was conscious of our eating issues making sure everything was prepared and cooked the right way so as to not upset my pregnant wife (i.e the fish had no mercury and the pork was cooked a little extra). We went through 7 beautiful courses of fresh wonderful tasting foods and came out satisfied and full.  Dinner was $185 with tip and worth every penny.  Now back to the ramen noodles!
