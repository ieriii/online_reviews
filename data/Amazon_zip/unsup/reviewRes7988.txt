I've heard several people rave that this is the best pizza in Chicago. Apparently they make the best Margherita pizza around. I have to admit...I am not impressed! The Margherita was relatively tasteless, the crust was too moist and soggy, and there wasn't nearly enough mozzarella on the pie. They did, however, offer burrata cheese as an appetizer, which was excellent. It's in the Ravenswood neighborhood, which is a hike to get to from River North or Old Town, and I have to say that hike is absolutely not worth it!
