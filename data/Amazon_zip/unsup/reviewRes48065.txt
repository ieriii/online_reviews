I enjoyed the meal here but thought it was pretty uneven overall. There were some very good dishes but a few mediocre dishes that I don't think the restaurant lived up to its reputation. - ham taster was great but they didn't do anything other than cut it and put out on a plate. The Benton's country ham always gets me. - fries were amazingly crisp and wonderful with the truffle essence. They must have been cooked in duck fat. - brussel sprouts were very good, had a nice vinegary and cheesy combination - the bollito misto was disappointing considering some of the items came from their butcher shop. I didn't feel like anything stood out. - mussels were ok but had a lot that didn't open. The flavors were a little muted. - banana cream pie dessert were good, liked the crust the best I guess I'm being a little hard based on all the glowing recommendations, was also there with 3 work people so didn't really order exactly what I would have normally. I think I owe them another try in the future.  Also one of the loudest rooms I've ever eaten in. Really super crazy loud.
