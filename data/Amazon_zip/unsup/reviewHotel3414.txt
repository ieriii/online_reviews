LOCATION LOCATION LOCATION I can't say enough about how great the Allerton is especially since it is strategically positioned between Gino's East and Giordano' Pizzerias. The fact that you could order the pizzas To-GO and bring it back to your hotel room to eat, bypassing the hours long wait in lines - PRICELESS! They are literally only a couple of blocks away. Of course, my wife loved the fact that they were smack center of Miracle Mile where all the boutique stores are. Overall the hotel was clean and modern chic. It is apparent that it is an older building that has gone through some renovation. But this adds to a bit of its charm, including the funny smelling elevator. Only elevators that are over 50 years old can have that distinct smell - hard to describe, but you'll know it when you smell it. The room was a lot larger than what one would expect from a hotel situated in the heart of the city. There was more than enough space to prevent us from feeling claustrophobic. I have stayed at some boutique hotels that were so cramped that you couldn't lift your hands to shampoo in the shower and hit my head on the wall trying to get off the toilet (really!). The fitness center is very large with equipment that have individual video screens and they provide you with disposable headphones as well. Chilled towels are also available so you can cool down after a hard workout. The only minus I found was the industrial flush toilets in the bathrooms - you'll know what I mean when you see it. It is not the kind that has the lever on the tank, but the one that is on the water pipe. In addition, the concierge was very helpful and can even help you to bypass the line at Gino's East. A definite must if you are planning to eat there.
