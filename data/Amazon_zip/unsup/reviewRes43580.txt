My friend Alisa and her best friend Robyn took me to M & H for brunch my last morning in Chicago back in April. Boy talk about a popular joint...nevermind that the place was small...only about 15 or so strategically placed tables inside...but boy was it worth the wait. Be sure to have a healthy appetite when you come cause the portions are great. From what I understand you can't go wrong on anything you choose from the menu. I wish I took photos of what we ordered..it looked and tasted great. A must go place if you're ever on Division and looking for a great breakfast or brunch place.
