Here's what I'm gonna say, I'm a Philadelphian with a great appreciation for the Chicago Hot Dog Culture. We have a few spots here in Philly too. I would give this place more stars if the line wasn't nearly 2 hours long. We waited because this place is a hike from my sisters place in Lincoln Park, and well, we had some time to kill and a hangover that could use the two hours before eating anyway.... What did I think? I had two dogs, one dragged through the garden and one with just mustard in onions, the sausage was just too intense for my hangover, and frankly there were like 14 of them on our table and about 8 got eaten.... The dogs were good, great even, two hour wait? I think that there at least a half dozen other hot dog joints in town that I would have enjoyed as much without the wait. On some levels, a hot dog is just a hot dog, is just a hot dog. I eat the dollar dog they serve at CBP and think it's awesome so.... anyway. Would I go again? If I knew there wasn't a line, definitely, but since it seems that this place has a cult reputation, I'm just happy to say I've been there.
