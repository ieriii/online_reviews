Found out about this place from a local from Chicago.  There are like 3 La Pasadita restaurants in this same area, but I like this one the best (1132 N. Ashland Ave).  The Carne Asada Super Burrito is my favorite.  You get a lot for your money here the food is fresh and the servers are friendly. (I am picky about Mexican Food since I have lived in Los Angeles). Every time I am in the Chicago area, I go here.
