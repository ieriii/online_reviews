Amateur hour and general chumpiness made it pretty difficult to actually enjoy the food, which for the most part, was really delicious, full of unique and unexpected flavor combinations pulled off really well...                 .but. We waited "forever" to be waited on, could never get the attention of the staff when we had a question or, say, wanted to order something (I'm not staring at you because I'm a psycho killer. I need something.) and the place was not even half full (it's a tiny space!) After some serious fussing on their part, they were willing to split the two entrees in the kitchen. We wanted to try a bunch of stuff, so ordered a few starters, which all came out at the same time on our tiny table. Then BOTH entrees came out, and we actually had to ask them to put some of the plates on the bar so we had some room. I wasn't trying to recreate a BUFFET EXPERIENCE (your new band), I'd simply like to eat, in sequence, a bunch of your foods. The real kicker, followed by a genuinely insulting gesture, came when we ordered something without salami (ono with tomato, shrimp, salami, olive). It came on its bed of salami, which we noticed after we ate the solo shrimp guy on top. They then did one of two things, and I'm not sure which is worse: 1) Reheated the original dish after removing the salami. The ono was overcooked this time, hardly the "basically sashimi" description given when ordered. 2) Recreated the dish, MINUS THE SINGLE SHRIMP WE ATE, cooked it poorly and sent it out. Seriously? You'd rather ruin the integrity of the dish than send out an extra shrimp? It was a tiny shrimp, even by a shrimp's standards. It was COLD because it was sitting on the bar for 5 minutes. Slighted via lack of shrimp. lame. I'm shaking my head because I had a nearly identical experience at Tallulah years ago. That place is closed now. I'm glad. I was *really* excited to fanboy it up with Dale Levitski after the meal, instead I walked out, right past him, pretty bummed. ps. Full disclosure, they comped the busted dishes. pps. I still don't want to go back.
