I tried to call and make a reservation for 10 but was told that they didn't take reservations... what a stupid idea. The problem is that with tables for 2, 4, or 6, they have to wait for adjacent tables to clear out in order to push the tables together to seat a large party. This plan took them over 2 hours. We waited. The place was packed. At first we were crammed by the bar. After awhile the waiting area cleared out and we sat down there and ordered a few appetizers so at least we weren't starving. The appetizers were quite tasty. We got Sweet Potato cakes which spiced with indian tasting spices and plenty of ginger. Delicious. We also had the popcorn with bacon fat and sage which was quite tasty. After we finally got seated the waitress was actually awesome. But I was so frustrated with the situation that it was hard for me to enjoy myself. I ordered vegetarian chili to start. It was decent. Nothing too spectacular. Then my husband and I shared the Tempeh Rueben with side salad and the Pulled Pork sandwich. Tempeh Reuben is not that good. The bread is hard and it's hard to take a bite, it's too small, and it is not very much like a classic reuben. I was so excited to try it and it was a major let down. The side salad however was absolutely fantastic. The pulled pork was insanely good and the best thing we had was the side of blue cheese potato salad. Holy deliciousness. They brew their own beer which everyone seemed to enjoy and we even saw people come into the bar and buy beer to go in sealed bottles so I guess that's an option too. All in all, I would try it again with a smaller party. The food was decent. The waitress was great. The venue has a great vibe, nice art, good music. But my first experience was mildly irritating.
