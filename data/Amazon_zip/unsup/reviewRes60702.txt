A favorite for a late lunch, w/time to relax. I try a new dish nearly every time. I appreciate their flavor profiles & seasonal dishes. I do love this place, but 2 things: although the staff is terrific, the service is always, always, interminably slow. Some slices of homemade bread or ... Something... Would help ease the annoyance of long waits. Depending upon who's making them, the cocktails can be terrific. The price point is a little high, but it only really bothered me when we tried the fish fry; $19.00 for 2 small pieces of fish & the plate filled w/fries -- & this ain't all you can eat. At $12 a plate, tops, I'd be 'OK' w/it, but $19 is way out of proportion to what you get.
