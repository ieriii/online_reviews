Five star service at a four star facility and an even better price.  The James Hotel is just a block off of the Magnificent Mile on Michigan Avenue. You can easily walk to the major sites in the Loop and River North areas, so think twice about the rental car. The hotel reminds you of the W Hotel style, but they deliver the product better than the W's that I have stayed at. The lobby is cool. The restaurant is cool. The hallways are cool. The rooms are cool. My room was interior facing. This was not an issue frankly because in this neighborhood a 16 story building is going to have a view of... well other buildings. So nothing missed out on with the view and I had a room that was quite spacious. The bed was uber-comfortable and the bath carried forward the hotel's modern style.  The service from the staff from the front desk to the bellmen was excellent. Whether it was directions, restaurant tips, getting me to Wrigley Field, not only did they take care of me, but the followed up afterwards. Great staff! Last tip, I scored a great deal on the room through American Express. I was going to use points and money to pay, but the rate was so good, I saved the points and just paid for room.
