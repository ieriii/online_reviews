I've been here 3 times and let me tell you--it is delicious! The food is absolutely amazing. I could eat here everyday if my weak white man's stomach would tolerate spice a bit better :). The service I've had has just been okay--I think the food is made fresh, which is one of the reasons it takes longer to get your meal. Be prepared to wait a bit, but don't worry, it's worth it! This is another Uptown staple that you have to try at one point in your life. It's delicious and there's something for everyone.
