The atmosphere in general was very beautiful. Beautiful chandeliers, murals on the ceilings, etc. However, I was not very impressed with our room. We paid $250 a night for 2 beds and 2 bathrooms. The beds were doubles (not queens). It was nice having 2 bathrooms. There were two major disappointments with the room. First, there was no mini fridge. I don't think I've ever stayed in a room without one. Second of all, there was one vent for the air conditioning to come in, and it wasn't very effective. We tried turning the air down to cool off the room, and the coolest setting it would go to was 64 degrees. But the room never cooled off below like 76. We were extremely hot!I have stayed in Hiltons in other cities, and I have never been disappointed....until now.
