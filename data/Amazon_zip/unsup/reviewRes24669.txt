Experienced a very tasty lemon rice soup! Although I have tasted food from here, I had never actually dined in. A colleague recommended that we have our lunch meeting at Artopolis and I was so glad that we did. I like that it is conveniently located by the blue line. In addition, the place is very spacious and not over crowded during lunch. My colleague found the best seat right by one of the windows (snow day bonus). Of course you put in our order up in front and you take your food tray to your desired table. I asked for water and they directed me to the self-serve fountain machine. I figured I would take my tray to the table and get back up to get water. I guess one of the workers heard me asking for water and was kind enough to bring me a glass to my table. My colleague had an Espresso and could not stop boasting about it. It was a pleasant lunch experience overall.
