LOVED IT! This was the only time in my life where I felt compelled to give my waiter a hug after my meal because I was so pleased (and I did!) My friends threw me a surprise birthday dinner here, and everything was perfect. We came on a Monday night and the place was actually pretty packed, but our party of 15 was comfortably seated in the spacious backroom. Most of us went for the $20 3-course prix fixe, which was such a steal. I'd definitely recommend the mahi mahi, which was covered in this great lemon butter sauce. The meal was also accompanied by a delicious bottle of viognier. But what really made my experience was the excellent service. Our server, Jim, was fantastic. Very attentive, friendly, and helpful--he even brought our check pre-split 15-ways without us asking! The manager also came to check on our table 3 times, which I really appreciated. Can't sing their praises enough. I will definitely go back.
