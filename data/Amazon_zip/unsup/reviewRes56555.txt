My Fiance picked the place for my Birthday dinner as I am huge RickBayless and Mexican food fan.Our experience was below our expectations, service was a disaster atbest. Our waiter was in such a hurry he did not even wanted to explainitems. My fiance is vegetarian and he was not able to tell us weatherstarting nuts were cooked in Bacon fat or not?For appetizers we had platter. and quesadilla had raw dough in them as they were not cooked properly.For the dinner we asked for Refried beans have Bacon fats or not, hewas not sure. My dinner item was ok at best and my fiance'svegetarian item was not even up to expectation. She ate chips andsalsa/guacamole, our waiter never came and asked whether food was ok or not.Margaritas and Guacamole? I had better margaritas in my life as I was expecting a whole lot more from Frontera...
