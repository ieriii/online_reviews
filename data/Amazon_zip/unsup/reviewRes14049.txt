I am not a lover of seafood. This restaurant helps me learn to love it. It was outstanding. My crab cakes were top notch tasty. My wifes dover sole excellent. also tasted the sturgeon, quite good. super helpful, friendly, knowledgeable waiter. it will take many return visits to try all the dishes i want.
