Pretty darn authentic food here! The sandwiches are very tasty, have a nice unique touch with the addition of plantains to some sandwiches, and have variety. The cuban sandwich was well prepared and I have nothing but thumbs up. However, 90 Miles does have a pricey menu for their sandwiches... Each sandwich costs $6.50 - which in terms of cuban food in Chicago, that's one of the most expensive sandwiches.  Nevertheless, it is worth having and experiencing for yourself! BTW - TRY THE MAMEY SHAKE! Totally worth it!
