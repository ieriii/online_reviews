All of the bad reviews seem to be people spazzing out about the wait, or the dress code, or the lack of cheap crappy beers and shots. The first time I went, I was with a rather motley crew, including a man wearing plaid pants held up with a safety pin and a feather boa. We had to wait about 20 minutes (maybe on a Thursday night?), then got seated in a delightful booth. All of their seating creates privacy in an otherwise wide open space. I think it's great. I'm in love with the tall backed chairs. The second time was at 11 on a Monday night. We were promptly seated at one of the only tables open, and there was seating available at the bar as well. So in regards to getting in, if you hate waiting, don't go on the weekend. Sorry. Now to the real reason people go to Violet Hour: Drinks. The Hummingbird is amazing, Juliet & Romeo is delicious. Oldest Living Confederate Widow is way tart and has a hint of black licorice? Winter in Tremont is somewhat disappointing. Bottom line is that these are the best drinks I've ever had and well worth the $12 each.
