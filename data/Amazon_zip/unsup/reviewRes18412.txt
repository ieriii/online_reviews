Mr. Bayless, I love your work. I wanted to love XOCO, too... I really did. But it just didn't live up to my own hype. I tried the enchiladas and the sope, and they both just didn't meet my expectations. Not salty enough? The fillers not filling enough? The cheese not tender enough? Perhaps I read too much about it before going. Perhaps it was the fact that I had to wait in line for a very long time to even order my food - thus making me overly excited to delve into what I thought would be a fireworks inducing meal.  Perhaps every other item on the menu is delicious and I just picked the wrong plates. Whatever the case, I was disappointed by my first experience here. It will not, however, prevent me from going again. I loved the atmosphere of the restaurant, the purity of the ingredients, and just the sheer dedication involved in putting together such a vast menu. I'm still a believer, Mr. Bayless, and I shall support your restaurants 'til the end. For now, I'll keep my stomach occupied with the corner hole-in-the-wall.
