Great margaritas! We had the tamarind margaritas, and they were strong and delicious. But they are expensive, I guess the Tue and Thu half off special would be a great deal but we did not know about that before we went there. Would love to come here on Tue or Thu just for the margaritas. I had the tacos (Veggie and Fish) - they were delicious and fresh made with great quality ingredients. The fish tacos are the bomb!!
