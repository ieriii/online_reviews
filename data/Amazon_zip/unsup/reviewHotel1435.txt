Holy disappointments! The hotel is BEIGE and kind of blah everywhere and the carpets/rugs are dirty and worn. There isnt nearly enough lighting in the rooms and the seating (one hard backed chair by the desk and one small pull out couch...no other seats at all) in the "suites" is non-existent...why have a suite that sleeps 4 or 6 but not enough seating for the group to all sit together in the same room to eat and/or watch TV? The food is nothing special at all, cheap ingredients disguised by froo froo plating presentations and high prices. The toiletries are cheap and the ancient TV in the bedroom of suite 1806 is so dark you can't watch the $16 movies ( BTW- engineering advised there is no bright adjustment because of the Lodgenet remote....but then nearly insisted on replacing the TV at 9pm while I was in my PJs, ummmmm, no thanks). Only reason I even purchased a movie is because it was cloudy and raining outside and so the cable/satellite was out ( searching for signal) on every channel for about 4 hours. The room doors SLAM 24/7 so if youre a light sleeper, bring earplugs. Good news ~ the beds are comfy, the location is excellent, close to alot of great restaurants and shopping, taxis are quick and easy to find. Cant believe this is where Oprah used to house her guests.
