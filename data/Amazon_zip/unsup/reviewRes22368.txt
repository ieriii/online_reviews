Amazing. There is so much good food to choose from here. Everything that we had was delicious, the service is outstanding, ambiance was spirited but not overly boisterous, and I felt that the many tiers of tables and smaller passageways in some places were part of its European charm - like eating in a Greek marketplace. Will definitely return.
