I went here for Valentine's Day and had quite possibly one of the best meals I've had for many months. Having lived in Barcelona for a period, I am quite familiar with Spanish food and tapas. Mercat a La Planxa does not serve your typical tapas menu. Rather, they take the Barcelona food, and place a very unique spin to the classic dish. Each dish has a wonderful taste and makes you wonder -- "just what else did they add to this to make it soo darn good?!" Seafood is important for Barcelona cuisine as it is at this restaurant. The grilled shrimp prawns were superb! Not doused in sauce, but spiced just right and laid right on the plate. The beef entrees are a real treat as well (although not truly a common Catalan staple, but they do it wonderfully). Fillets are cooked just like a great steakhouse. Come here to try a new Spanish-style restaurant. Leave here knowing you ate amazing food with great modern flair to old spain-classics!
