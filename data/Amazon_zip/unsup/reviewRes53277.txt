Presumably one of the best restaurants in America, I was prepared to be blown away at the cuisine, elegance, presentation and ambiance of Alinea. I was not disappointed.The 18 courses were served throughout the three hour dining experience with impeccable timing, alongside well-paired wines for each. Highlights of the meal:- An entire piece of driftwood presented topped with seaweed and containing some of the best seafood I've ever tasted - Helium-filled balloon made of green apple taffy- Bowl of hardened white chocolate, filled with strawberry, English pea and lemon that was smashed onto the table in front of usMake resos far in advance!
