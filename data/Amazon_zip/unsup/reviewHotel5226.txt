I stayed here twice for business in the winter of 2010. One time I had a very large, gorgeous room with a wonderful view of the John Hancock building and lakefront. The size of the room almost swallowed the king sized bed. The other time the room was much smaller but came with a small sofa, and the view was of the city. The elegant decor, bedding and furniture all befit a Ritz-Carlton hotel. The staff were always pleasant, helpful and eager to serve - they were almost disturbingly subsequious... The food in the meeting rooms was the only mediocre aspect of my stays - just typical hotel food. A truly elegant, luxurious place to stay on someone else's expense account!
