Wow! Talk about a delicious yummy pizza! A friend was telling me about this place, we were deciding where to order pizza from. So he suggested Pequod's. This was not a disappointment. The crust is amazing, it is almost like a caramelized crust the way it is baked. Perfect combination of delicious sauce and cheese. One of the best pizza's I have had in a long time! I'm a fan!
