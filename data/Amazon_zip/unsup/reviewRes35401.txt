One of my favorites in Chicago. Oysters are always fresh. Martini is cold and have ice chips in them. The key is top sit at the oyster bar side of the restaurant, and not the dining room, or you'll risk having a stuffy dinner next to some 630 and 847 tourists.  Our favorites are 4p.m.- 6 p.m. happy hour for oysters. You can get a dozen for 1/2 the price, which is about $6. If you go on Thursdays(and one other night), they have live blues and it makes the atmosphere really fun. I frequently take out of town guests there because of its casual atmosphere, great service, and friendly Chicago crowd. Bartenders(especially Arturo) are very friendly and makes sitting at the bar a treat! We always order 6 Fanny Bays and 6 Kumamoto's, and a couple of martini's to start. Last night, crab cake with caesar salad and lobster bisque for me. My boyfriend got the combo with a 6 oz filet mignon, scallops and prawn scampi. We ended the meal with a slice of key lime pie. Wow, it totally hit the spot and thus a good Friday night begins!
