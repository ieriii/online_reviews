I was disappointed with my pizza. I think this place is very overrated. Im sure if i got another pizzza with toppings of my choosing i might be a little more satisfied . But then again i liked most of the toppings minus the mushrooms. Maybe im just not a deep dish pizza lover. The service was great and the staff was super friendly. Expect the lady who was the parking valet,she was jerk.
