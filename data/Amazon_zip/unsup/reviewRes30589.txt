Had a great dinner here with my husband. I have not had a steak in 2 years and decide to go for it. I forgot what I was missing, it was wonderful. The lobster mash. potatoes were excellent. Since it was our Anniversary they brought a butter cake which is the best thing I have ever tasted.  Enjoyed the Chicago Rest. better then the Scottsdale one.
