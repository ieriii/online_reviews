This place is fantastic. The setting, the staff, the owner. But the food is the what keeps me coming back. The arugula and proscuitto antipasti is perfect. The pizza makes me miss NY just a little bit less each time I go. Don't go if you love Chicago's strange interpretation of pizza, the pan pizza. This is the real thing.
