I heard about this place constantly for over a year before coming here for the first time a couple months ago. I haven't stopped thinking about it since. I've worked it into conversation just to think about it some more. I've left work early in order to make it during their hours. I even left work 'sick' once just to sample some alligator. I'm the adventurous type so I tend to order off the specials menu at least and usually get the game of the week. I've had some misses here, the lamb sausage wasn't really my thing, but the hits are hits in a big way and even if you only have one sausage here you've liked it's good enough for the five star rating. The duck fat fries are over-hyped but are tasty, give them a try at least once. Small and short hours keeps the place very busy, be prepared to wait... and wait.... and wait.
