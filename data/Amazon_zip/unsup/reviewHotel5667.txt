This place deserves 5 stars. We stayed here our second night in Chicago, (after staying at The Drake) and it did not disappoint. To be honest, it was nicer than The Drake in a lot of ways, and I certainly prefer the rooms at The Talbott. I'd actually stay here over The Drake next trip. We stayed in a standard king, which was over 500 square feet! I love boutique hotels because they have so much more charm, and this one had a lot of it. Downstairs, they have the restaurant Bice, which is very classy too. It's true that the little things make this place so charming such as: a small living room, a designer remote control, Aveda products, excellent bathrooms with nice lighting and a bathrobe, free umbrellas, complementary passes to EQUINOX fitness, 3 telephones, electronic maid service displays, and a newspaper hung on the door in a cute little Talbott bag. Additionally, the room came with a lot of Chicago magazines for hot spots, as well as a beautiful Small Luxury Hotels of the world book (which is free for you to take and very handy!) Book online and you should also receive a $15 breakfast credit. Try the waffles if you're a fan. They're really good. The only complaint is that if you're staying on a higher floor, the elevator can be a little slow. Overall, excellent hotel, great service!
