We ordered the godzilla, wakamono, kani chung and peter parker rolls --- all amazing!!! Also got the the house salad with ginger dressing, green tea ice cream and heaven & earth (chocolate cake topped with vanilla ice cream) --- again, all amazing!! No complaints about the flavor or quality of food ... but we were completely turned off when the manager questioned the tip that was given to the waitress --- who was by the way inattentive and unprofessional. I would never go back.
