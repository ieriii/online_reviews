So there's really only one thing that I like on the menu, the avocado and smoked gouda sandwich. It's bad ass. Their crabcake sandwich is terribly dry and not so flavorful. I've tried it on three separate occasions and I really want it to be good, but it's really really not. I wish they'd do something about that... The sides here are ok. I wish they'd change it up a bit more though. I'm tired of the boring beets, edamame salad, and basil pasta salad. I know this place can be better. Live up to your potential milk and honey. BTW, the pastries are very good.
