I went here for the first time when I was visiting Chicago. The food is pretty tasty, however depending on what you get can be VERY spicy.  Even though my mouth was on fire, I found the food to be very delicious. The food all has an authentic flavor, and they even have daily drinks, which are very good... if you like sweet drinks that is. When I went the place was very crowded, then again the place is somewhat small. The line can be long at times, but moves faster than you think and you get a table pretty quickly. I would definitely go there again.
