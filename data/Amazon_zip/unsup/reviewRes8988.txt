TLDR: fancy vietnamese cuisine with good decor and strong service, though at a higher price point. Food: Good flavor profiles. we got imperial rolls (solid though not extraordinary), the beignets (very good), the spring rolls (adequate), pho (small but the soup base was well flavored), the fried snapper (well done), chicken claypot (also very well done though lots of standard asian places also do a strong claypot) and bar-b-q pork salad (good). Decor: really nice - woods and nice earth tones and a clean but not too severe look. like a lot of the upscale vietnamese places it has a french colonial vibe. the upstairs bar is nice -- would have like to have a drink there back in the days BK (before kids) Kid-friendliness: Only high chairs but the service was very good and they were very cool with the kids during the business lunch rush. One complaint -- their valet sucked. Made me wait 10 minutes in 100 degree weather and humidity before he even showed up. Not cool.
