There's lots of sexy ass dark curtains and candles and funky looking chairs. The decor is alice in wonderland meets matrix. The drinks are all fancy stuff I've never heard of, and I had to pretend like I knew what I was doing so that I don't look like an uncultured douche. Looking at the crowd and atmosphere, I felt like I should be wearing horn rimmed glasses, ball-hugger jeans, a pair of chucks and a sweater over my shoulders. Then I could sip on cocktails and talk to my white friends about how awesome arizona immigration laws are. but instead i'm an asian guy wearing fake jordans who looked at the bill and said, "holy shit i'm broke now." i think this place totally sucks. but the girl i brought was really impressed and i got a goodnight kiss, so 5 stars bro!!
