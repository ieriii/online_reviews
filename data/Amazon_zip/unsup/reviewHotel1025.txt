This was the spot i went to religiously. Stayed a couple nights every month for over a year until I decided to branch out and hit some other properties. Great location just north of the river. Walking distance to all manner of activities. Nice lobby , always a friendly staff from the doorman to the guy that works the happy hour.Rooms are standard size and beds are comfy. Get a corner room if you can its got a different layout and seems to be quieter than a regular room. Corner suite was rocken like dokken. This place also has a free happy hour from 5:30 to 7 every nite except i think Sunday. Nothing brings people out like free food and booze. Get there early and watch people descend like locusts. I once saw someone have their wedding reception at the free happy hour. Crazy! No restaurant on site but Keefer's and Harry Carey's , great steakhouse-see my review on that , are down the block. Dozens of restaurants within a couple blocks too. No pool either but that doesn't bother me Its a sweet hotel and I recomend it to anyone going to Chicago
