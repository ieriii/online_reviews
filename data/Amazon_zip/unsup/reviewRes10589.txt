I love Piece because it gives me everything I want in a pizza-- chewy crust, really fresh toppings, and served with an amazing beer.  Their topping options are great-- they have anything you can imagine including clams, mashed potatoes, bacon, and banana peppers (which sounds kind of gross now that I'm listing them all together-- but, trust me, you can make some amazing pizzas with so many choices in toppings) And the beer is awesome too-- they have a great selection of homemade brews-- I personally like their Camel Toe, a sweet and citrusy IPA, but last time I was there they were out, and found they also have a really nice selection of non-homemade beers (also, they have Strongbow! Hooray!)
