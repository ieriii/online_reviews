I've gone here twice and both experiences continued the trend of being disappointed by over-hyped restaurants. I've tried the porchetta, beets with goat cheese, eggplant caponata, milk braised pork shoulder, and one of the paninis. Of that list, everything was serviceable but nothing striking. The only redeeming qualities was the bottle of wine we ordered and being outside on a nice day. Other than that, I don't see myself going back. from my visits on 9/4/11 and 10/7/11
