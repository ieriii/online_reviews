So, I used to LOVE this place (in my 20s and often at 3am...) but since Chipotle, I can no longer enjoy the authenticity of it! Still, that is because I'm fussy. So, it still gets a good review because it was my 2nd home for many years. They are open late, typically good food and fast, great margaritas and the wait staff has been there forever. A Chicago staple you must at least try!
