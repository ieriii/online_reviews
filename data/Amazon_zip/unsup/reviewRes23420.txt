I'm giving them two stars based only on recent visits. Several years ago I would have given them 3, maybe even 4 stars, but quality - or at least consistency - has fallen quite a bit since then. Expectations have also risen, as competition has stiffened not just from the two sister restaurants, but from other Chinatown restaurants improving, too. Most people may not know this, but Lao Szechuan is named the same as the most famous restaurant in Chongqing, Sichuan province. Those are big shoes to fill, and it's unfortunate that Chicago's Lao Szechuan doesn't come closer to filling them. First off, the hotpot here is just unacceptable. Even on a good night, it's of poor quality and not reflective of how good hotpot can be. Best hotpot in Chinatown is at Mandarin Kitchen, across Archer from Lao Szechuan. Second, on a good night you can still get well-made Sichuan food here, but it's really become hit or miss. 50-50 is about right. Finally, it's still worth taking the gamble if you want something on their expansive menu that you can't find anywhere else. I'm hopeful that as Tony gets his restaurant empire under control quality will even out and improve across the board. Until then, though, I'm sticking with my two-star review.
