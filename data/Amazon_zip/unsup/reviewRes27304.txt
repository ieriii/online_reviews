Okay, yes- you are right, snooty yelpers. This place isn't amazing. It's not fancy. But you know it is? Cheap. Fun. And pretty darn good. Brought some of my fellow North side friends down here this week for a little byob and Mexican food. What Nuevo Leon lacks in nice atmosphere it makes up for in it's welcoming and comfortable decor and wait staff. The food is solid. Maybe not amazing, but solid. And cheap. And plentiful. Plates full of stuffed burritos, tacos, tostadas and the like, most all for less than $6. Not everything can be amazing, sometime you just have to put your money on a solid bet. Or a huge burrito.
