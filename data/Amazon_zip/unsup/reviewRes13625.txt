Bottoms Up Wit beer - Good wheat beer, but a little lighter bodied than I expected. It reminded me of a cross between a Paulaner Hefeweizen and a Hoegaarden. I had the fish and chips because it's good bar food! I thought they were rather delicious too! I would go again, even with the hipster crowd in the area. Meh... still worth it!
