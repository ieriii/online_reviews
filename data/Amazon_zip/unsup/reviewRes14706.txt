So I was reviewing my reviews (yeah, I know).. I realized that my last two reviews had been crappy. So, to better my self image and feel better about myself, I figured I'd write a legitimate, good, review. A prerequisite: I don't go out on Friday or Saturday nights (because I usually work). I hate weekend crowds. So, every time I've been, it hasn't been too crazy. Crowded, but not insanely crazy. I love Revolution. First off, I live nearby - which is an automatic star in my book. Second, the staff is friendly. Seems to me that a lot of local spots have the "too-cool-for-school" arrogant, iPod hipster thing going on. That's not cool. Revolution has some great folks. The food is wonderful. They're new-ish, they're working out the kinks. Some of the food has improved over the first time I visited. Other items leave a little more to be desired. Revolution offers a well-thought-out menu that pairs very well with the beer on tap. The beer is phenomenal. As I mentioned above, they can only get better. A wonderful selection of their own (amazing) brews, as well as a fantastic offering of some other fairly well known beers. Love the hand-pumped drafts as well. This place has really helped me keep the faith in my hometown restaurant scene. Chicago has some fantastic local spots. Revolution is a shining star among them.
