Rick Bayless !!! Have The lines are long for this "technically" fast food mexican place but every sandwich on the menu is just awesome. The sandwiches on the menu are very elegantly composed and definitely a great value for the price. The Wood oven chilaquiles were just amazing. If you are just in the neighborhood and don't want to eat anything, stop in here and just have their fresh juices. I think they are rotated every week (or day) and they are definitely a value add to the menu. If as a tourist you don't get a chance to visit the clark location, fear not, they have another place in O'hare. I saw them in AA terminal but from what I hear, there is a location in the United terminal as well.
