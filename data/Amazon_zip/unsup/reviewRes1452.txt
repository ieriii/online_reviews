OK, after reading all the reviews and seeing it on the Food Network and Travel Chanel a couple of times I had to visit this when I was in the area. The service was great. The owner is incredibly friendly and kinda funny. Not the kind of place where if your not sure what to order they are going to rush you. I actually tried ordering 2 large sodas and he insisted just to order 2 smalls because its free refills and he was going to rip us off when he totaled the check anyway (he was joking obviously). I'll be honest the regular hot dogs were not that great, I mean they tasted like any other hot dog I've had. But the specialty hot dogs are awesome. I remember ordering an angus steak hot dog which was amazing. The regular fries taste just as good as the duck fat fries. The taste difference is subtle and you notice during the after taste. If you there during a time when you can get it I would recommend it. Just remember one order of fries is good enough 2 hungry people. My girlfriend and I made the mistake of ordering duck fat fries and regular fries. The line kinda sucks, but it moves fast. It is well worth it, just order whatever they have on special. Don't order more than 2 (might be tempted with all the selections) because 2 is way more than enough to fill you up.
