So nobody should be whining about the wait and giving this place fewer stars because of it. For God's sake, you can't help that the stuff is SOOOO good that it creates an insane demand. So somehow, on the way home from the airport, I whiz by at 1215p on a Wednesday and there's NO LINE. You're kidding me. They had to have run out or they're closed or there's a shooting inside. None of the above. So here's my chance and my wife will hate me because she always wants to go except for the line. I get inside and there's one person ordering before me. I peruse the menu and want EVERYTHING in there... except for the regular hot dog because for God's sake, you can get that down the street. So I double up and get the Dave Kingman (Chicken sausage, Santa Fe style) and get a special dog of Marsala and Roasted Garlic Wild Boar Sausage with Anchovy-Parsley Goat Butter and Black Pepper Affinois Cheese. HOLY CRAP. I nearly died of a pleasure heart attack. The meat was outta sight great and it was clear that these were prime cuts and fresh. Not the scrap that hits the chopping block to fill the sausage sleeve. Because I couldn't resist, I ordered a small fries as well. Polished it all off. The fries were fresh cut, crisp and hot. Just the way they should be, unlike a number of the local brethren's sloppy grease sticks. I only wish I could have eaten more and been able to transport the little lady in for some as well.  I will not buy a lottery ticket because a trip to Hot Doug's without a line is a once-in-a-lifetime situation. BTW, I would wait an hour plus for this again.
