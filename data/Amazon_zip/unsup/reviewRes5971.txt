THE MOST A--AMAZING DRINKS IN THIS TOWN. DID YOU HEAR ME!!!! AAAAAAAAAGGGGH. A FREAKIN-MAZING ME AND THE MRS. HAD A-GREAT TIME NOT INTO STEAKs BUT THEE ''MOST MOISTIEST'' CUT IT WITH A FORK PIECE OF MEAT EVERRRRRRR. POMEGRANATE MARTINIS FOR THE MRS. AND ONE FOR ME. (Actually 3 for her and two for me--hee hee). I didn't drink it out of the martini glass (I got issues with the look of them), instead a highball on the rocks!!!! BOOOOOM. Ya' gotta go! we were celebrating her returning to work after our second child was ready to go to school.  What a luck guy, brother bartell
