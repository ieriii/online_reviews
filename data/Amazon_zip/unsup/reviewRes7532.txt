I just went there with about 18 other people for a going-away party, and it was one of the best (four course) meals I have ever had. Service was impeccable, bread was hot, pasta was decadent, and the tiramisu.... well, I don't normally like tiramisu at all, and I swear I would have eaten the entire table's worth. It was like heavenly fluff. It was a little on the expensive side for a poor college student, but man, it was worth it. I don't think I'm going to be eating for the next week.
