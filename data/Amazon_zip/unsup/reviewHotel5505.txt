Great location, friendly staff. My boyfriend is in Chicago for business and I tagged along. We only stayed one night, but the front desk staff were helpful and friendly. Our room was clean, our shower was HUGE (we might have gotten a handicapped room, but that was sweet!) and we got complimentary water bottles. :D Continental breakfast was acceptable -- the cinnamon rolls they had smelled delicious! Only downside to our stay was a noisy neighbor who was yelling curse words for about two hours at midnight...and that we had to pay $22.00 for the day's parking.
