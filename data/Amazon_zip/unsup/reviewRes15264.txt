prices are slightly high but the quality of everything is A+... the beers are great and ...ok lets take a moment of silence. bacon fat popcorn. yes. are you serious? this brought out the lil fat kid in me. ohh dear, i might just go right now to eat some. and the burgers are bomb! the $27 steak did make me laugh though. last time i checked we were in logan square. all n all a great spot for a few beers and the BACON FAT POPCORN!!!!!
