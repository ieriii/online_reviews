This place is interesting. For one thing, you can order a dish containing just about any part of a pig you could want. But if you're not a pork eater, there are other offerings like buttermilk braised rosemary quail. If you're just there for drinks (fairly impressive wine list), the meat and cheese platters are amazing. You can choose from over a dozen cured meats and a wide selection of delicious cheeses. The fried appetizers are not so great. The batter is akin to frozen mozerella sticks and makes the different offering taste very similar to each other. Compared to the quality of the rest of the menu items I would pass on those. The atmosphere is relaxed and fun, but still nice enough to feel good taking a date there. Our service was friendly, but could have been a bit more attentive. Expect a wait.
