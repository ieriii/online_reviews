one of my fav chicago brunch places. i used to come here on sundays. the food is pretty good and its in a great location. (hooray for wicker park!) and, you can go shopping in this area after brunch so you can try to burn off those 4000 calories you just devoured. the only thing that sucks is that the lines here are long, esp on sundays. and yes, this place is full of hipsters, but whatever. better than paris hiltons.
