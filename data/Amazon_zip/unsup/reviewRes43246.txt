Ymmm, you surprised me last weekend Milk and Honey....I thought surely my moodiness at Owen and Engine's decision to no longer serve brunch on Saturdays would make every subsequent attempt at a good morning futile. Thankfully upon instructions that the wait was only about 15 minutes, I proceeded to Division toute suite! 20 minutes later, I was ordered and patiently sitting at my lovely indoor table. Last time I visited, the Huevos Rancheros in their own individual casserole dish were, GASP, sold out! To my happiness, they were still plentiful so we ordered one and the Belgian Waffle with berries and whip cream... the Huevos Rancheros are delicious, flavorful, and perfectly portioned. The waffle was good, but I enjoy a crispy outside soft inside waffle, and this one was more chewy, gummy. Despite the gumminess, the berries and ample whip cream and butter made things a-ok. This plus the giant cups of coffee, and I was a happy camper.
