Great food, amazing staff and customer service, and a cute, heated patio. I went on Sat. and I'm already ready to go back. Take your own wine for their sangria, which is great, or take rum for mojitos--which we didn't know about or we would have tried. Regardless, it's BYO w/o a fee and everyone LOVED their food. Four people with four different entrees and lots of good tasting food all around.
