We love Calo!  We haven't had the pizza (yet) but have really enjoyed all of the pasta dishes we've tried. The gnocchis are wonderful. The asiago ones are tasty, the gargonzola ones are drool worthy.  We also love the spinach artichoke dip. It is quite different from every spinach dip we've had. (It's probably made with heavy cream or something equally unhealthy :)!)  Our 20 month old daughter loves the minestrone and gnocchi. And the servers and staff are super friendly.  One of our current favorites!
