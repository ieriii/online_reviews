Best cupcakes ever... Sprinkles taste like cardboard in comparison. I love the all the different flavors but the chocolate carmel is my favourite. Macaroons are really good too. And also Intelligentsia coffee need I say more ... Good friendly service they even put a little heart in my mocha. Try this place. You won't be disappointed.
