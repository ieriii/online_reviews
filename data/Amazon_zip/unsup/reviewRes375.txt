So much has been written about Alinea. The restaurant is an extraordinary experience, yet I can't give it 5 stars. I waited a couple of weeks before writing because I wanted to be sure of my impressions. Fyi - we had the twelve-course meal. What I didn't like so much: fishy-greasy smell when we walked in. And overall, several preparations were too salty for my taste. I was ready to love everything. But as the evening progressed, I didn't have that blissful "yum - bring it on" feeling. There were too many fried onion slivers as well. And one dish had a melted butter ball in a clear wrapper - like one of those bath beads you drop in the tub to dissolve -- except this one came with a warning to puncture it carefully so as to not be sprayed with hot butter. Hmm, dangerous food; interesting. What I liked: attentive service; comfy chairs (important because you want to spend hours enjoying the meal). The freedom of not looking at a menu - letting the chef decide what to serve. Amazing creativity in both food and serving pieces. Beautiful presentations (the people at the table next to us were snapping photos). A wine pairing that complemented the food and let us try interesting varietals and vintages. Considering the complexity of the food, it's too bad that saltiness stands out for me. Although there was a new dish based on rhubarb that was gloriously pinky-red and fun (I skipped the onions).  The dishes were beautiful works of modern art. So I'm wondering--is it possible to be so complex that something gets lost? Like using all the colors in the palette and ending up with gray? I'm glad I went to Alinea. I'll always remember the unique presentations and the fun evening with my family. If I'm looking for purely delicious though, I'll choose Tru or Trotters.
