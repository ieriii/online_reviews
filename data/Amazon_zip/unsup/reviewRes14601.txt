Excellent beer, incredibly friendly staff. Food is pretty delicious and made for eating while you are drinking beer, and there are definitely solid vegetarian options for those who need it. Large space, very comfy and cozy waiting area, so don't be put off by an hour-long wait; you can have a beer by the fireplace while you wait. The atmosphere is very welcoming, and inclusive, great for a date, a family out for dinner, or just getting a couple beers. A very welcome addition to Logan Square's restaurants.
