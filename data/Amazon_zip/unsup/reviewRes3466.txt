Wow, this place is soooo good! Being pretty well versed in Korean bbq, tofu stews, and fried chicken, I was a bit skeptical about this place at first. Fusion menu's always seem to create this dichotomy between tradition (the past) and innovation (the future), often times falling flat and getting caught in the middle ground.  The beauty in Crisp's menu is the simplicity in which they offer this fusion approach. It's progressive, fun, and accessible w/o completely distorting the tradition. I decided to try the Seoul Sensation burrito, which has rice, onions, tomatoes, chives, corn, spicy sauce and their homemade marinated Korean beef, Bulgogi. First off, the burrito was ENORMOUS. I could have eaten half and been satisfied, yet it was so delicious and mouth watering that I finished the entire thing, along w/ a side of fries and a drink!! The Bulgogi was so tender and yummy, and the corn added such a nice texture and flavor, it was a huge surprise. Everything was fresh and full of flavor.  Next time I go back, i'm definitely trying the fried chicken and sides. They had combo meals in the restaurant which included both and were pretty affordable. I also can't wait to try the buddha bowl, which is essentially their version of bibimbop. What can I say, this is such a fresh, new, and wonderful concept you must experience to believe!
