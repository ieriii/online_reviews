yumm!  yes, i know it's a chain and a bit touristy, but i don't care! i'm a chicagoan, and i love it! good prices, great food. the southwest salad (i think that's what it's called - it's the one with the tortilla strips) is one of my favorite meals ever. the smoothies are also really good - my friend and i get them the morning after too much partying - they're really good for that. light, refreshing, hydrating. mmmmm.
