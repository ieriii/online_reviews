I wont be going back to Bin 36 anytime soon. The wine, wine flight, and cheese selection is extensive and decent, not anything new and exciting. The atmosphere is drab and is reminiscent of a cafeteria. For a wine bar, the immense main dining room is too large and empty to make the experience enjoyable, even when wit a large party. The starters we had were all tasty, yet not outstanding. For great atmosphere and wine selection, try Sable which is just a few blocks away.
