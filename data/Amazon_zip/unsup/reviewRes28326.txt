Ive been coming here since I was a little girl and I must say that I have not tasted better fajitas nortenas (beef fajitas) anywhere! Its byob! Its not a small place but every year I keeps getting more crowded. If its a small group we just wait in the line like everyone else but if we're having a larger party we usually just have them cater (pick up only bring towels to lay on your car floors because it can get a mess on your car). Pros: the food is delicious and you can't beat the price and byob. Cons: parking is tough, long lines, no credit cards accepted, high noise level! Pros outweigh the cons!
