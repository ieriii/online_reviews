Thumbs up for their deep dish pizzas, thumbs down for their salad. They deep dish pizzas are very filling, VERY! I couldn't not finish my slice. Their Italian beef is also delish, but make you tell them to dip the beef into the meat sauce or else its really dry on the bun. I had the "supreme salad" and it was basically pizza toppings with lettuce. On the menu it sounded pretty tasty and healthy, but the combination was terrible. Its a good spot to eat when you are starving and the pricing is very affordable.
