Went for lunch. Lovely meal. The service was attentive and the food was very fresh. Sampled the Truffle Egg Toast, the Grilled Romaine, the Sea Urchin pasta and the Burger. Everything was delicious! Only downside is that the place is very small and crowded, so go early or for lunch. If not, expect a wait.
