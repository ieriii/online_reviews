I love this place! Great wine, incredible cheese, and great food. And you can go as high end or low brow as you want. If it's a light snack, sit at the cheese bar and get wine and cheese flights. A casual dinner (or dinner on your own), sit at the bar and order a burger. Pair it with a flight or big glass of wine. And a big dinner sit in the restaurant. The choices of wine are great and always affordable (and if you sit at the bar you usually will get a sample of something else to try...) Fantastic!
