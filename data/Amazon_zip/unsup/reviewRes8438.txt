This is a delicious place! I've been three times now, starting first in 2007. They do excellent Naples-style pizza. I'm curious to try some of the new places that have opened in Chicago that also claim to serve this type of pizza. This weekend I went and we had some rave items: -Burrata -- like a fresh mozzarella but sooo creamy inside. Spreadable on toasted baguette. (I've bought this at TJoe's before, but Spacca Napoli's Burrata was way better. Almost incomparable). -Pizza funghi - delicious. Lots of mushrooms.  -Pizza margherita - excellent and a classic. I'm not an anchovy fan, but that's how we order it here and I love it. -Good wine. We ordered a house-wine priced bottle of red. Loved it. -2 other pizzas off the specials menu. Good too. Watch out for not getting too many toppings -- that will weigh down the pizza. There are no reservations, but we were served 2 hors d'ouevres during our 1/2 hour wait for a table. An aged mozzarella, and also a little fritter with seaweed in it. As soon as we sat down, the server brought complimentary glasses of prosecco, also much appreciated! Overall, delicious and our choice place for an "italian" pizza!
