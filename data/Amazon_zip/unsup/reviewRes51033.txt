I was here on a Sunday at 1:00 for late brunch. Our reservations were for 10 people, and my only real complaint is that they weren't exactly prepared for us. Seven of us showed up before the hostess was "allowed" to have the busboys start putting tables together. Then they rearranged the tables. Then they rearranged the tables again. In the meantime, we were crowded into the bar area hovering over people who were already seated. Not that we were trying to hover - it was just the only place to stand. Once the seating was taken care of, everything was great. The food was fantastic, and the coffee was really good too. They were a little stingy with the Splenda, but that's easily forgiven. This place isn't anywhere near my house so I won't be back often, but I would definitely check them out again if I'm in the area.
