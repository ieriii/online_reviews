We had the pleasure of dining here last Saturday night and had a fantastic time. The food was delicious...we had so many things none of us can decide what our favorite was but I am leaning toward the calimari or the mushroom pizza, or the selections of cheeses or actually, the cantaloupe vodka. What really put it over the top, though, was our server, Erik. He led us to some choices that we might not have made that were fabulous. It's great to have someone with an opinion who really knows the food, especially in so new of a place. We can't wait for our next trip.
