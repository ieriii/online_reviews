I really really enjoyed this place. Not only was the service impeccable but the food was just as good. We started off with the fried ravioli and while it was relatively expensive for what you get, it proved to be well worth the price. I believe it was something like $5 for 6 pieces. My dish, the farfalle pollo was fantastic. Really enjoyed this dish and the portion proved to be more than enough to fill you up. I ended up taking somewhere between a half and a third home with me. My partner had the Conchiglie Gorgonzola. It was very good, but I liked the farfalle pollo better. I will most certainly be making a return trip to the Pasta Bowl, it has definitely won me over.
