MUST GO TO RESTAURANT IF YOU WANT A GREAT DESSERT...... Grand Lux Cafe is a tough place to review for a serious foodie. First of all, as so many other people have pointed out, its just like the Cheesecake factory and has the feel of restaurant where they "turn and burn" the tables. The little foyer at the main entrance is where you leave your name for the long wait you will have to endure if you go at a peak time. The food sizes are crazy and if you actually finish your main course you are an official fat b*stard/b*tch. If you go here for a appetizer or main course, you will have a very average experience. However, if you go for dessert after eating in another restaurant you will be in for a great time. The desserts are baked to order and can take over 20 minutes to arrive (its worth the wait). The Molten Chocolate cake is amazing (takes 30 minutes to get to your table but sooooooooo worth the wait) and is as good a dessert as i've ever had. The New Orleans Beignets are also amazing and great to share. I rarely give a shout out to service staff however Joe K. has served me a few times and he is an extremely nice guy, with great knowledge of the menu and is always prepared to go the extra mile for his customers. If he serves you, you are guaranteed top notch service. Go to Grand Lux late in the evening, after all the madness of the dinner rush is over and have amazing desserts.
