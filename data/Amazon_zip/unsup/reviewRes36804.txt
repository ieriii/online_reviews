When I went here I went with a group of friends for a quick dessert. I tried their green tea ice cream and they had a red bean ice cream at the time. I also tried their Mango sorbet cake...DELICIOUS!! I was very apprehensive to try the red bean ice cream but when I did it was like a symphony in my mouth.... MMMMM SO GOOD!! Only thing is I wish the ice cream and cake was a bit a larger in portion size. Don't get me wrong the presentation was phenomenal but, the small amount given didn't satiisy my hunger for more lol! I haven't tried anything else but, is planning to go back with my hubby for a romantic dinner!
