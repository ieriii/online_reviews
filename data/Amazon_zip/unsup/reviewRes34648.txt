My favorite spot for good quality sushi in chicago! I love this place because you get what you pay for. You pay a higher price for the signature rolls but you are getting 8+ pieces and the rolls are huge! Some rolls even come with a special sauce. My favorite is the veggie roll--it has a name but i cant remember it. buddah maybe...? All the staff is super friendly and helpful. The place is small so make sure to get there before you want to eat in case there's a wait.
