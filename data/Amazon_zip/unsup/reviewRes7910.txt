Yum, yum, and yum again! Not only is every piece of meat delicious and mouth-watering, but the salad bar is gorgeous and fresh and tasty! Not to mention the lovely cheese puffs, polenta "fries" and mashed potatoes brought to your table even if you haven't eaten what's there, they'll bring you fresh sides. The service is out of this world impeccable. The wine list divine and the dirty martini's will blow your skirt up!! I've tried one other and the meat was under-cooked (I like mine med-rare) and not too tasty... like it was cooked too fast. The salad bar wasn't as sumptuous either.
