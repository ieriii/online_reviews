Awesome decor and great food WHEN YOU FINALLY recieve it. I have been here a few times and speed is not the name of the game, i will say the first time was new year's day so it was busy and that is always an interesting brunch. The buffalo chicken brunch salad 110% makes up for the wait. Staff is very friendly i definitely will continue going!!!
