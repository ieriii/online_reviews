Went for one of their first brunch services. Sat outside on a glorious day. Food and drinks were great. Clearly a foodie haven. It was so hard to pick what we wanted because everything looked so great. Settled on the eggs benny which did not disappoint. Next time, I'm having one of the sandwiches, they looked wonderful.
