This place is AMAZING. Wings are freshly fried when you order them, and they're not like those puny wings that you find at other so-called wing places like Yak-zies or even BW3 (which I still do love). These wings are Texas-sized wings that come in different sauces. Try the Korean BBQ or the Seoul Sassy. Best wings in Chicago, period.Jon, the manager, is also awesome - makes you feel welcome and always asks how everything was and what he could do to make the experience better. And he knows his stuff - we got to talking, and he told me about the different types of ways to marinate chicken, how to keep wings fresh and crispy, how they make their own sauce, etc. Go now and have the best wings, then thank me later :)
