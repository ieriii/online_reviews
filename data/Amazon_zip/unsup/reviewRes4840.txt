Before I visited Chicago, all I thought of was pizza and hot dogs. Now, I think of purple pig too. We ordered a few things from each section and EVERYTHING was good. Milk Braised Pork Shoulder, Turkey leg were both really tender. Bone marrow was creamy, and the bread served with it tasted really fresh too. From the salads we had something with corn, and the beet salad with goat cheese. Pig ear with banana peppers were probably my least favorite, but even that was fresh and flavorful and still recommended. AND the service was amazing. The servers were attentive, quick, and really friendly. Oh, the website also features a monthly recipe, with seasonal ingredients. I'm excited to try one of 'em.
