This restaurant was recommended to me by a friend to eat at before heading over to the museum ... but sadly I was very disappointed. We ate at the bar and I ordered the House Poutine because I am a huge carnitas fan. There was about a teaspoon of carnitas pork and the rest was soggy greasy french fries with cheese and some vegetables (which did not seem to fit with the dish). On the up side my daughter had a burger that she loved and the third person had a salad that was ok. I may try it again or I might not.
