Reviews cautioned that the restaurant was dirty and service slow. Well, we decided to go anyway. Upon arrival we were told that our reservation was not ready - as a prior reviewer warned would happen. We went to wait in the bar and ordered wine served in dirty and sticky glasses - as a prior reviewer warned. While waiting, we realized the fuel smell from the fondues was overpowering. Our wait gave us time to notice the aged corkboard on the ceiling and the generally dated decor. Finally we decided to leave.
