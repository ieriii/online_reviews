This place makes me so happy. The food is often very good, but isn't as "clean" as vegetarian food can be. If it wasn't for the menu selections and the creativity in choices, as well as the cool factor of this spot, it would be just another spot. Yet, it has easily become one of my favorites in the city. I'd love to see more macrobiotic options aside from the (thank god there is one) Macrobiotic Plate, yet, it still makes me smile when they call my name to be seated.
