Right off the bat, I was taken aback in the best way by the exquisitely lovely manners of the hostess from the moment I phoned in the reservation, saying she would look forward to seeing us with a warmth that suggested we would be visiting someone's home. When we entered on a rainy day for lunch, there was no valet but she made a great suggestion about where to park. The restaurant was absolutely elegant, it really did seem out of place and time, a vacation in a restaurant! We were taking out older parents who were not accustomed to Asian cuisine for a little culinary adventure, and they were SO pleased with the ambiance, food and service. The food was quite excellent; delicious pho, absolutely fresh goi cuon, and everyone liked their entrees (clay pot chicken, tofu curry noodles, crab salad, sesame beef, eggplant). Delicious plum sauce!  There were lots of choices for my vegetarian husband and the food was not too spicy for our parents. We left full and with leftovers. The reason I gave it four stars is that it's a little bit expensive, and if you're used to Asian food you can probably find satisfactory meal for less $$$, but it was a really nice, tasty and relaxing experience with attentive, kind service and it's definitely worth it for a special meal out or a "stay-cation."
