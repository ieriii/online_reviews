A likely story. High profile address with lots of tourist traffic and waugh, waugh the food is Boring. Under seseasoned and trying like a culinary student to be progressive but misses because you still haven't mastered the basics. I wish it was better, believe me. Points off for Gastro Pub claim and not hitting the mark in the execution of the food as advertised on the menu. Definentely points off for not offering the Day's Specials and then telling them to me after I brought it to my server's attention and my meal was over.....? Points on for the friendly service and the attentive manager on duty.. Sometimes they tend to hang out on a Sunday night or give you the cold shoulder because you mentioned the food was off the mark. Dessert: go for the house made gelatos and warm beignets for the best midnight snack. They're kitchen is open until midnight FRI - SAT.
