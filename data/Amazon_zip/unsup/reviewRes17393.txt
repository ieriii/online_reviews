1) The line is just for show. They make you wait in line even if there are empty tables.  2) The music is too loud to allow for easy conversation. Our group requested several times to have it turned down a bit but the request was denied, probably because the owners felt that too-loud music would help make the half-empty rooms feel as if there was activity going on. Also, the sound system was of pretty poor quality. 3) The drinks were decent, but prepare to spend some big bucks. 4) The atmosphere is nice, but it was hard for me to get over the pomp and circumstance of waiting in line for no reason.
