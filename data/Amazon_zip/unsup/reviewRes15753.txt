I have these moments where my twelve-year old self shows up and high fives me for living the cool life. Violet Hour elicited such a moment.  I've genuinely liked every drink that I've tried here--and I'm very fussy. The Lady Grey Martini, I'm pretty sure, was made with me in mind. It's beautiful.  If it didn't cost 11 dollars, I would have one every day after work. The only problem is the wait... I think that everyone is doomed to that fate, no matter what time you show up. Both times that I've visited, we arrived early--too early, apparently, for them to actually open the door, even though it was after 6, or whatever time they claim to open. Hrmph.
