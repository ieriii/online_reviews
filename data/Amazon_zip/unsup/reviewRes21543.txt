We didn't like it and we won't be back. The service was pretty bad. It was hard to track down our server to get a refill. It was super loud and we could hardly hear each other talk. We ordered queso dip and it came out like water - no joke. When we asked about it the server (once we got him) said it was normal. He was kind enough to swap it out for some guac, which was pretty tasty. We ordered fajitas and they lacked seasoning and had some fatty pieces on them. With all of the great mexian food in the city we will not be back.
