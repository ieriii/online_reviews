Ah, do I love this place. Lighting & ambience perfect for relaxing and having a few laughs with friends or a date. Servers are personable and wait staff are efficient with setting and removing plates. Curio bar downstairs is table service, fyi... Food was fabulous... My date and I had Steak Tartare/Toast, Pot Roast was to die for (braised for hours) melt in your mouth!, Mushroom Truffle pasta soo Yum! I personally do not think this place is that expensive, but some other people think otherwise. $$-$$$ DRINKS... 10th Generation-You MUST try this, perfectly blended gin & pear. They have a drink for everyone, whether you like whiskey to tequila to vodka to gin to champagne drinks, etc.. All in All... I will definitely be back!!!
