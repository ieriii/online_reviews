I went here with a group of five people. We ordered the vegetarian sample and the meat sampler (8 small portions of selections off the menu.) Everything was delicious and the portions were large. The two $15 sampler plates filled five of us up and then some! The injera was fresh and tasty. Service was good. I will definitely be back!
