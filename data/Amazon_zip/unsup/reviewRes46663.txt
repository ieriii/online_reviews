Best burger I've ever had! My boyfriend and I went here for lunch. We both got burgers that basically melted in your mouth. I got the Grubburger and he got the Peppercorn burger and we were both beyond happy with our meals. I like my burgers medium rare and this place actually delivered. My boyfriend also got a chocolate shake and loved it. When we got there the wait was supposed to be 20 minutes but we were seated in less than 10. The service was quick and friendly. We will definitely be going back soon!!
