Delicious. Rick Bayless's star power makes up for overpricing. Eleven dollar torta may come with a free souvenir (a photograph con el hombre), if you are shameless enough. Schedule is strange. Would like to be able to access Rick Bayless's tortas on Sundays and Mondays too. Five days a week are not enough for me.
