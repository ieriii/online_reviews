This morning's hangover would have met any food with delight, but this meal actually warranted it. The vegetarian crossiant was pretty good, breakfast burrito better, but plain and simple eggs over medium with wheat toast, that was the best. Crowded, not really a secret I guess because there were people waiting outside for a table, but I want to go back for lunch and dinner.
