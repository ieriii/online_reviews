What I applaud Big Jones for is their willingness to add different (or what might be seen as obscure) items to the menu constantly, something few Southern restaurants around Chicago will touch in an effort to be domesticated or whatever their reasoning is. Sticking close to fried chicken, mashed potatoes, mac n cheese, and maybe fried green tomatoes as a specialty. BIG WHOOP. Not Big Jones. I don't see many others shelling out hog's head pt and cajun blood sausage, just to name a few. He nods to historic dishes, even dating particular dishes circa 1920 if it is. The Gumbo Ya-Ya and Shrimp & Grits have been staples at the restaurant for a while. I'm also a fan of the Red Beans & Rice and the Reezy-Peezy. If you want to ease into the food without feeling like you handed your bank account over, try the lunch option they have, served family style for 16 bucks a person. I have yet to try an alcoholic drink here and I should. But I do enjoy the teas. Keep up with the Big Jones blog, too. It's a fascinating read.
