Yum! Pequods' pizza is delicious and definitely worth a visit. It's not typical Chicago pizza, but if you're up for crispy pan pizza, this is the place to go. It's not as bready or cheesy as most pan pizzas around Chicago, but the burnt crust sets it apart than others. I would suggest ordering extra cheese because the cheese is kind of scarce without it. There is also a lunch special too which I like best because the pizzas are small making the bread extra crisp.
