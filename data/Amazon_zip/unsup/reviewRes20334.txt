Finally made it over to Xoco on a random Tuesday night. At 8:30 PM there was a line almost out the door for both a table and take out. We almost walked out but saw that you could get drinks while we waited, and the line actually moved fairly quickly. I thought they could have done a bit more for how much a "fast food" dinner costs, but when the food arrived, it was definitely worth it. We got guac & chips, both types of pork torta sandwiches- I think one was baked and one was grilled, the churros & ice cream with chocolate sauce, and coffees. My boyfriend said it was the best sandwich he's ever eaten. Wouldn't recommend it for a date, or if you're in a hurry, or looking for a cheap dinner, but the food is at least 4 stars.
