What a gem! I love this restaurant. So boyfriend and I were in the mood for Tango Sur but we didn't feel like waiting for one to two hours for dinner so we decided to try Las Tablas and it was love at first bite! :) The Entrada steak is great! With chimmychuri sauce on the side, it is a little taste of heaven and it was only $19. The steak came with plantains, yuca, and potatoes. The portions are huge and we had a lot to feast on the next day! (Not the best meal if you are on a low carb diet... and they don't have any subsitutions for the sides... but oh well!) We ordered the Empanadas as an appetizer. I normally don't eat fried food, but I would have to say they were quite delicious. My boyfriend was not thrilled, too greasy for his liking. I would totally go back to this place. Great service, great food, great ambiance! What's not to love!? Also, the fruity alcohol drinks are so fresh and yummy and suprisingly strong. I had the sangria (SOOOOOO GOOD!), the mango motio, and a strawberry martini. Great urban oasis! I felt like I was a resort for a few hours... not in Chicago. I want to go back .... now.... so good! Give it a try, you won't be disappointed!
