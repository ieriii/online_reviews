yum! i caught up and had dinner with an out-of-towner here--it was great! we didn't wait very long for a table, but the table we got was one of the tiny ones along the back booth area. although i was sitting very close to fellow diners not in our party, it was still enjoyable (except for the occasional eavesdropping from my left and right--i guess our conversation was that interesting!). we had a super cool waiter (who by the way had a super cool mustache!) who suggested a great muscato riesling from spain and getting the 3 different kinds of oysters. my friend had the scallops and i had the striped bass, both of which were excellent. everything was just savory. we decided to go all out and have dessert as well. we had the pastel de tres leches y maracuya--it wasn't too heavy or sweet. the tartness of the maracuya did a nice job of downplaying the usual sweetness of pastel de leches. staff was super attentive from the hosts, servers, runners, and attendants. sometimes, it was almost too much--i felt self-conscious. however, it's better than being ignored and not serviced. there are tradeoffs. ;] the atmosphere is loud and lively. it's definitely a place to go for an animated dinner and not a quiet, romantic dinner. the decor was ok. some sections were better designed than others, but i appreciated the use of color. (although, the awning and restaurant front were nothing like the inside.) if you like to try new foods and food culture, i definitely recommend checking frontera grill out. although honest,y i don't think i would've ever gone if it hadn't been for my friend! it was good, but i don't think i was wowed. perhaps it was the good company that overpowered the restaurant's ability to wow. :) regardless, it was a positive and memorable dining experience!
