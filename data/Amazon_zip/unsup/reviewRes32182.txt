I think we have a contender for best Ethiopian in Chicagoland. I still love love love Ethiopian Diamond, but this place is neck and neck. Very flavorful food. They have many vegan options, including the mock-fish shimbra assa (which is a little different from at The Diamond). Staff was very friendly and welcomed our infant there (who was very well-behaved, like the other children there). We had a groupon and didn't print it out and they had no problem.  Definitely will be back. Salivating at the thought.
