I feel really bad giving Hopleaf anything less than 5 stars--they've been like a great friend for the last several years, with their always friendly bartenders and wait staff. This is my favorite beer spot in Chicago, and regardless of my present complaints it will continue to be, since their beer is top notch and the atmosphere is fun and casual.  With that said, I think they may have made a few miscalculations in the new space that they just opened. Admittedly it's only been a few days, so hopefully things will improve and run more smoothly. But I was there this week and was seated in the new space, at one of the rear tables next to the kitchen. These tables are a horrendous idea--my partner and I couldn't hear each other over the shouting of the waiters and cooks, and after an initial jaunt past our table, we didn't see our waiter again. We quickly tired of this and moved to one of the open-seating areas by the new bar; this was far superior. I love the long table, and the terrific open space. We ordered food, as we usually do, and the quality control seemed rather off. Obviously I can't chalk this up to the kinks of the new space for sure, but it seems likely. We ordered the CB&J, an old favorite, and their sweet corn waffle, one of their new seasonal dishes. The CB&J was about as mediocre as I've ever seen it--thin and greasy, like a diner grilled cheese. The waffle was overcooked and dry, a problem which was only exacerbated by the lack of sufficient sauce on it. The veggies were great, and the sauce was great; but the dish wasn't well prepared and was totally unbalanced.  As I said, my complaints should be taken with a grain of salt. This is a fantastic bar and restaurant for anyone who likes good beer in a laid back atmosphere. I will continue to be a regular customer here. I just hope that they step up the quality control on the food, and do something about those terrible tables by the new kitchen!
