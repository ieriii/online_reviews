I have visited this place a few times, never being thrilled about the food or service-- and certainly not about the prices. The last time was the last straw. The waiter seemed indifferent, refused a coupon that was given to my friend by a local merchant-- though that may be the merchant's fault for distributing expired coupons-- and rushed us, asking us how our food was a minute after bringing it to us (we had not even tasted it yet). Then he brought the check before all of us were finished. Okay, message received.All of that would not have upset me, but I developed food poisoning shortly thereafter. I'm not saying that Uncommon Ground definitely gave it to me, but it seems strange that the same night, after eating their salad, I vomited lettuce. I missed two days of work as a result, not to mention the vomiting and other, um, unpleasantness. Again, I don't know if it was directly their fault or the fault of some mystery food that entered my system as I slept, but, to be safe, I'll not be going back.
