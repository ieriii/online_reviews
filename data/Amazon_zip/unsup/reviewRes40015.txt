I have no idea how I have not reviewed this place. I have been coming here for a few years now, and the only thing that has really changed are the prices and the decor slightly. The one downside is that you have to cook your own food, and sometimes I'm lazy. And I know you can ask them to cook it for you in the back, but then that completely defeats the purpose of Korean BBQ. The amount of side dishes they serve is absolutely absurd it's like a dozen little dishes surrounding the table. My favorite side dishes being the seaweed and tiny fish. But they don't always serve the tiny fish which is naturally sad.
