We stayed in one of the executive double bed suites. Absolutely marvelous marble bathrooms...lovely shower...Rooms was decorated beautifully. We had large screen TVs in both rooms. The toiletries were wonderful...Had room service in the morning and the Eggs Benedict was EXCELLENT...Service was prompt, efficient and friendly. Couldn't have enjoyed it more. We'll be back this next weekend....
