My absolute FAVORITE pizza in Chicago so far! Every time I eat here, I wonder why I ever eat pizza from anywhere else. Seriously. They have 3 pizza sauces: Plain, Red, and White - and surprisingly enough to me, even the white pizza is really good!  I think their service is pretty average...maybe even less than average...but the pizza makes up for it - it's just that good. :) Good idea: have a party there. Good pizza, good beer, good times. :)
