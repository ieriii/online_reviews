Maybe I went here with too high of expectations. Maybe I wouldn't be so salty if dinner for two didn't cost $225, but this place was WAY below par. So SO disappointing. There was nothing special about the food, drinks, ambiance, anything. For sushi there are far better places with less ridiculous prices. For the money I'd MUCH rather go to Japonais or Sushi Samba. Too much hype over this place. I was disappointed.
