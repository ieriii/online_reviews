So far - my favorite sushi place in Chicago. Food: - We ordered the rock shrimp tempura, crispy rice with Kobe beef, several cuts of sushi (mostly fatty tuna) and the pork belly entree.  - *Almost* everything was great. Some of the best items we ate came as recommendations from our British waiter Ben. We called him Big Ben behind his back, but I don't think he'll care. - The one thing that really blew us away was the escolar. That miraculous little piece of white tuna was something else... entirely our waiters recommendation. Did I dream about it like he claimed I would?  No. But I did have a minor religious experience and saw the fish Jesus - Fejus. He tasted delicious. - The one bad note, and sadly came as a huge recommendation, was the pork belly. I love pork belly.... but this thing was FRIED. It was super dry and the sauce was over salted. Overall: The pork belly was a huge disappointment (I love devouring the flesh of pig) - but I still gave them five stars anyways. I might be too forgiving. The escolar was incredible and they had super fresh sushi. You also have to order the crispy rice if you go - somewhat unique and bursting with flavor.
