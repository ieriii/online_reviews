OMG! I've found my most favorite dish to eat EVER! Their Bandeja Paisa-rib-eye steak served with fried pork belly, rice, beans, fried egg, sweet plantain and avocado-is the most amazing dish I've had in a VERY long time!!!! The pork belly is huge and fried to crisp perfection. The rib eye comes in 2 giant pieces, the beans are a little salty but so flavorful and delicious with the rice, avocado and egg. And it also comes with a piece of arepa (their delicious savory corn bread). OMG....I thought I was going to explode from all the food, and I only ate HALF my plate!!!! This dish is a very traditional Columbian dish and I can definitely understand why it's so popular! There were 6 people in our party and 4 of us ordered this and all of us were in food heaven! I also tried the Langostinos al Carbon-their grilled shrimp on a small bed of salad. The shrimps are the same that come with the entrees, grilled perfectly and super succulent! There's about 6 for each appetizer and goes great with their jalapeno sauce.  The coconut flan is good if you like coconut and REALLY sweet desserts cuz it's REALLY sweet! The figs are pretty tasty but there's only 2 or 3 with a big scoop of caramel..not really sure what you're supposed to do with all that caramel, it's also way to sweet to eat by itself.  I'd say Las Tablas is not really the place to go to for dessert, but OH MAN! Their meats are out of this world!!!!
