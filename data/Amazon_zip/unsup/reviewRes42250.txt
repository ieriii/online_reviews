Ah, they still won't let me give this place no stars! Out of extreme desperation because Siam was closed on Monday we decided to come here and have dinner two weeks ago. We had their spring rolls as a starter and Tony had their pho special and pork and rice. I had their bun rieu which is a crabmeat noodle soup and mia and their pho with meatballs with a side of avocado bubble shake. Their spring roll smelled like musty mildew towel. As if they had premade these spring rolls way ahead of time (or maybe days) left it in the fridge with a wet towel placed on it so it wouldn't get hard. I couldn't fathom to eat it because the smell was just overpowering. Tamia's tapioca balls looked like they've been sitting out for weeks. It was soggy and disgustingly out of shape. The fruits on top of her drink looked like they were scooped out of someone else's leftover drink. Tony thought his food was okay but couldn't stand the smell of mildew lingering on the plate and cup. I get that it's reasonably price to eat here but damnit have some dignity when it comes to your healthy. Seriously, if you're that popular live up to it quality wise. Just because you are attracting all the yuppies and what not doesn't mean you skimp and cut corner just to make another dollar.
