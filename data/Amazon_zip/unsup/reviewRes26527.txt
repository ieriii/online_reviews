I absolutely love Mexican food and growing up in southern California has made me a tough critic. I have been to Nuevo Leon twice now and love it. Not only is the food the real deal, everyone is friendly, service is fast and the food is delicious and cheap! The first time I had enchiladas and today I had the carne asada burrito. They also bring out right away the pickled carrots, peppers & garlic, warm chips with 3 different salsas and their delicious chicken soup before the main course. I still can't believe that both huge entrees were only $6!! Will definitely be back very soon! FYI - it is cash only.
