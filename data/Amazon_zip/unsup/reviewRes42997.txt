Was here a few weeks ago to meet up with a friend I hadn't seen in a very long time. We got there right around 5:30 on a Friday (peak time for after hours), but had called to make a reservation earlier. Be sure to make a reservation or you run the risk of not getting a table as this place was hopping! Our waiter was extremely friendly, never pushy, and very patient with us as we sat there for close to four hours catching up on the happenings of our lives. Food and drinks were very speedy even though it was packed and our water glasses were NEVER EVEN CLOSE to empty before they were refilled. That is such a pet peeve of mine in every restaurant I go to. We left feeling like this was our new place to get together and catch up. Hopefully, it will be a bit more frequent than every six months, but even if it's not, we know we won't be rushed out of a table here. Thanks for the great service!
