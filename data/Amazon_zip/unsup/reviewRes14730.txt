I've been to Revolution twice. Both times I experienced stand-offish, slow service from the waiters/bartenders even though I was there for birthday celebrations both times (myself and later a friends). The food, while decent tasting, and a more unique menu selection than other eateries in the area, is dramatically over-priced. The last time I went, the salad I got was under-garnished (I think it literally had 3 simple toppings on it- I could have made it at home with my eyes closed!) so basically it was all lettuce and to make matters worse it was heinously overdressed. Not worth spending in the range $10-15 if you ask me. The atmosphere and interior are cool there but I don't think I'll be back anytime soon for the overpriced food and cold, forgettable service.
