After my first visit, I had reckoned that I should return in the summer for best results, but nope--it was a bitterly cold January night that found me at Bad Apple again.  We were there relatively early on a Saturday, and, since most of the restaurant was wide open, I didn't appreciate being stuck at a table in the front bar area where one side of the attached bench seats doesn't even have a back. It didn't ruin my meal but it did annoy me. I mostly came back (and am mostly writing this update) for the beet salad. As it turns out (sadly), this is a salad WITH beets rather than a salad OF beets. But it was still well conceived and executed: radishes, pickled red onions, fresh mozzarella, and sweet corn & thyme dressing. Good stuff. I also ate the rosemary chicken sandwich, which, while the meat was somewhat dry on the edges, was quite tasty. I upgraded my fries, and they did not skimp on the minced garlic. It's really a 3.5 and I will keep them on the secondary list for future visits, but they still haven't blown me away with food, service, or beer selection.
