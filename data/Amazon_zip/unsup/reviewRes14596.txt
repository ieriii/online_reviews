A great experience all throughout, a truly old school family Italian restaurant that serves great food at a great price. The staff is always pleasant as well and the owners make a point to stop by every table to see how your meal was. Their food is rustic heartwarming, and there's always enough to take home. They excel at the more traditional dishes and have some truly authentic offerings (their lasagna is straight out of southern Italy). Give it a try, it's priced way below similar Italian "fine dining" options and it's truly a unique experience.
