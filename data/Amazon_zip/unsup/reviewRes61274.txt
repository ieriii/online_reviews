This restaurant was fantastic. It's hard to find words that define this place to what it deserves. It was amazing. The staff was really nice and cared about how everything was going. The food was so different and served in such an interesting manner it was great, the experience was one of a kid. There is a never ending array of meet coming to you constantly so make sure to come when your very hungry. The owner is also really pleasant and he comes to your table to see how everything is going and hes great. Everything was just wonderful.
