I was pretty excited about trying this place out. Went on a Sunday night so it was empty and for some reason the hostess sat us in the bar room. This was disappointing because the main room is supposed to be really cool. Anyway our waitress was great. Ordered up a raspberry mojito - sooo good. I probably could have drank five of them. Ended up splitting four apps in rank order of 1 being most tasty; 1. Ropa Vieja 2. Flores y Camarones 3. Hiramasa ceviche 4. Arepa All were very good and plenty of food for two people. We also ordered the tres leches for dessert. I was pretty full already but the tres leches was way to sweet for me. Total meal was $70 which was probably because we only had one drink each. As many people already said, this place seems great for a big group or a fun date.
