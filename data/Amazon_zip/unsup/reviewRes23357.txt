OMG! So delicious. This unassuming (kinda shack-like) restaurant is amazing. Bring some booze to drink while you are sitting outside on the curb, because it will be a wait. But it's well worth it. *I do wish they would rebuild that space or move, the actual space is caca - but good food is good food.
