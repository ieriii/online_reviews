My girlfriend, my friend and his wife celebrated NYE with carnivale. It was all we had hoped for. The drinks and food were amazing. We started out with guacamole and fish tacos. Both were so fresh and delicious. My friend and I had the steak... It was to die for. My girlfriend had the beef tenderloin with a goat cheese puree and his wife had the pork shoulder. All the food was great. They also had live entertainment to ring in the new year!!! It was well worth it!!
