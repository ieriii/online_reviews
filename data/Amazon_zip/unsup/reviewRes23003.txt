Alright, I like Irazu OK, but the reviews here are from folks who love it, and I don't... First, if you don't eat meat, you'll probably give this place more stars than me. See, they've got the best rice and beans ever! Super tasty, yummy, etc. And as far as fried plantain goes- their's is fried perfectly, not overdone and dry, not underdone, perfect and light as far as fried food goes. When I find the discipline to order a sandwich or something, with a side of the authentic rice and beans, I'm pretty happy. But every time I go here, I drink beer during the forever wait, then read the menu and decide that one of the tradition/authentic dishes that involves grilled ribeye, rice and beans, and plantain is what I need to have to satisfy all of my cravings.  When the food arrives, I take a whiff and am taken back to my childhood by the smell of a steak fried in a frying pan- like my Mom would make in the winter. I hated those things- that's no way to prepare meat, unless it's breaded... So I'm not a big fan of the ribeye- thin and kinda tough, and you can smell it was fried in a pan. And knowing that, the menu keeps making me think I'll like it anyway! But I don't.  So Irazu gets 3 stars from me, for great rice and beans, perfect fried plantain, but ribeye fried in a pan that I order after a pretty long-ass wait. I just don't like beans and rice enough to make this place worth the crowd as a meat eater. When I finally break this cycle and try the chicken, I'll have to update my review...
