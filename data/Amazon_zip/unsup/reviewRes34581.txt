NOTE: This review is not based upon the food, but simply the service. The other night my gf and I wanted to try this place out after hearing nothing but consistently positive reviews, we had to give it a go. According to their website, an option is made available to order online. We've done this before with other restaurants in the area and have had great results. So we placed our order in around 6:30 PM and didn't hear anything for the next hour. At 7;45 PM we decided to call and asked them about our order. They then informed us that their ordering online option is not available and that they would call us back in 2 minutes. Upon calling back the only thing they could offer us was our order within 15 minutes. After waiting for almost an hour and a half you'd think they would come up with a better solution, like say a free meal due to our inconvenience. However, due to the inability to truly cater to the customer and not really care about our business, I will never ever get food here. AND AGAIN, it's not because the quality of their food is poor I can't fairly judge that. But the quality of their service is absolute horse shit. UPDATE: My girlfriend just called the restaurant and while they were apologetic they still didn't offer us a free meal only one at a discounted price. Then when my girlfriend tried to reason with the manager and discuss our better experience at another restaurant in the area all the manager could do was apologize again and say this is all I can offer you then hung up. I really don't like to go on record and complain about a place like this, but this is pathetic.
