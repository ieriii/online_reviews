Talking about exceeding expectations!! Owner of the restaurant is amazing - warm, helpful, fun and accommodating!  Yesterday was my second time at the Little Bucharest. First time was a lovely dinner for two on busy Friday evening. Yesterday we had a birthday dinner for my mom. Since we had more than 6 people, the owner offered a complimentary limo that picked us 30 min before the dinner. It arrived on time, made for an excellent surprise for my family and a wonderful start of the night.  Once in the restaurant, atmosphere, service, interior, wine and food were amazing! Food was prepared excellently with just enough flavor. Even on Sunday night the restaurant had live music that consisted of Jazz pianist and a singer! Definitely a place worth a visit and a wonderful addition to Chicago dining scene!
