Casual, lively and authentic. I made reservations 6 weeks in advance and was only able to secure a 9PM reservation!  This place was hopping on a Thursday night at 9PM! We started with the specialty drink - a Mexican Martini, perfect to start the evening. I started with chips, salsa and guacamole. My husband had the queso fundido - two kinds of cheese mixed with veggies and onions served with corn tortillas. The salsas that came with the chips and the appetizer were amazing, the habenaro salsa was flavorful but HOTTTTTT.  The waiter warned us - he was right.  I ordered the Falda Asada "Brava" (skirt steak) it was cooked to perfection, served with grilled onions, tortillas and a sweet corn tamali. I'm not a huge Mexican food fan, primarily because in California it's typically saucy and cheesy. The flavors were in your face without assaulting you. My husband had the Pozole de Frijol. It was delicious. I found their Salsa at Albertsons - you'll never use another salsa again. The Chipotle and double roasted salsa are my favorites.
