I loved this hotel. Stayed a total of three nights in May of 2009. We had a one-bedroom suite, which was very clean and well-decorated.  One of the most comfortable hotel beds I've ever slept in. The bathroom was amazing! It had a rainfall spout shower and a tub next to it, all encased in glass. I was very impressed by the bathroom.  They didn't have much in terms of food options, and so I'm giving it four stars.
