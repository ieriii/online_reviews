No complaints. No complaints whatsoever. I'm so glad that I finally got a chance to try this place. I've been driving by it for the last year, so curious about what the story about this place. All it took was a really sunny day and a picture of their fabulous outdoor patio to finally get me there.  First, since we don't have many sunny days left - definitely take advantage of their patio. It's proably the best one I've ever had al fresco dining at. Now, the patio definitely is the selling point, but even if this place didn't have it I would still give it 4 stars. The food and service were great. I started out with a special gazpacho that was perfect for the warm day and surprisingly filling. I personally hate it when I can differentiate gazpacho with salsa, but the consistency of this one was much like a bisque with more texture. Delish. As my main course I got the grilled seafood salad and this is absolutely one of my favorite dishes. Who can say no to grilled shrimp, calamari and scallops served over a bed of arugala in a light vinegrette. It's just what I was hoping for and definitely filling. I haven't tried their dinner menu, but based on my first experience there I'll be sure to come back again.
