Been here a couple times and both times delicious!! Mojitos are really good...And I love that skirt steak dish. The rice was pretty greasy the second time around but nonetheless delicious and even better with another mojito :) The atmosphere is just really fun and lively and the bartenders and servers are really nice. The hostesses were also really nice and held our table even though half our party was pretty late. The only thing I wouldn't get again are the churros.
