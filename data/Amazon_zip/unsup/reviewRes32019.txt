I finally got around to checking this place out thanks to groupon. Let me be straight. This does not compare to Ras Dashen which i think is the best Ethiopian in the city. Kapeesh!! Here's the good and bad. I went in on a friday evening with a groupon without reservation and they were gracious enough to find me a table even though it looked quite crowded. thumbs up!!. The appetizers here were yummy. Cant beat that. The communal plater was decent and on the spicier side for some. Not bad but not amazing. The injera was a bit sour. this restaurant might be suited for the typical american. Nothing wrong with that.but if you want real authentic atmosphere and food i would suggest the other place. I was a bit disappointed with the limited menu options due to the use of groupon. I also got a feeling that i was treated a bit indifferently because i had a groupon. The service staff isnt very organized. Dont hate it though. I dont want everyone to start going to ras dashen and make me wait in line :)
