First, let me say that I'm not a real big hot dog fan. That aside, I decided to head to Hot Doug's for my first Chicago dog as a Chi-town resident. Wow, was I impressed! Chi-town dog for $1.75 (tax included), fries for $1.50, very reasonable. They also offer some very interesting specialty sausage creations like antelope sausage with bacon-garlic mayonaise, blueberry-merlot venison sausage with blackberry mustard and goat cheese. I haven't tried any of these yet, but I'm sure they are fantastic. Their fries are some of the best around, dog was the best I've had, and Doug (who can be founding working the cash register) was a very friendly and genuine person. The only downsides to this fine establishment are that they do not accept credit cards and sometimes the wait can be over an hour just do get in the door. I'm not saying I'd ever wait that long for a hot dog, but if you go at the right time, it's definitely worth checking out.
