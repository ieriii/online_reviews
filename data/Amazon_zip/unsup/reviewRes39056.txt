I have had many a memorable evening at Longman & Eagle. The cocktails are peerless. They are inventive yet don't take you too far into the rabbit hole. I have had burgers, vegetarian specials and an array of appetizers. Even the cheese plate was great. One day had an afternoon craving and the cheese plate was really all that was available before dinner service started. You may be full but - portions are ample - leave room for dessert. Whether savory or sweet is your thing you will find a nice finish to a great meal. I took off one star hoping the door staff might tone down the attitude just a bit. While rare, you can be a friendly hipster. I give loads of extra points for that.
