So the decor isn't that great but it's a typical vietnamese restaurant. The food is excellent. They have a very comprehensive menu. I'm actually not a big fan of pho, I usually order the grilled pork chop over broken rice with a sunnyside up egg on top. It is to die for here, marinated meat and yolk drizzled over rice (YUM). I would also advise getting the grilled pork hoagie, best hoagie i've ever had. The grilled pork is so juicy and tasty, so cheap too I think it's like $3.50? The service here is avg/good for a pho restaurant. I also like ordering a mung bean milkshake or their 3 color bean drink. Both are delicious. This is definitely the best vietnamese restaurant i've been to so far.
