The first 7-8 times we went, it was a 5-star place, maybe a 4 on a bad day. We went Saturday and it was a 1. Serious disappointment. Server had no interest in helping us. My Almost Wife asked for one pancake to substitute for her two pieces of toast. Denied. "We can't do that," she said with a scowl. And then followed the dreaded: "I can come back if you have not decided yet." She was just very cold and rude. OK, I thought, at least the food will be good. Nay: Her omelet was watery (spinach, tomato and mozzarella will do that, cooks) and my pear and egg thing was good but not memorable. She refilled my coffee once, when it was mostly full. It sat empty for most of the breakfast. She forced a smile when she dropped the check, but it was a pretty bad experience. Meli has earned enough in the past to get my business at least once more, but I am not going to be enthusiastic about it and am in no hurry to return. Sad but true ...
