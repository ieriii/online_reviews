I'm all about taste and not presentation. I don't know about you but I don't really care that much about how my food looks, just be good. That was a little problem I had here. Everything looked absolutely amazing and mouth watering, but, did not taste nearly as good as it looked. If your gonna make it look that pretty, you darn best make it taste up to what your presenting. I also thought that the portions were too small. I don't want to pay for art (unless it tastes as good as it looks), just good satisfying food. The service was great along with the atmosphere.
