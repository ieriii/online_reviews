Dear Pequod's - You have just lost our business forever! ~ Also I will be posting this review on Facebook so all of my friends can read about your terrible business practice as well.. We have just moved to a new apartment in the city last month and we called what "used to be" our favorite pizza place to see if they deliver to our new neighborhood. YES! They do, they tell us! "Awesome!!" - Send over a pizza we say! Great, they say. It'll take about and hour and a half they say. "Sounds good" we say...........We wait......We wait........We wait........ We wait.......Pizza never shows up............... We call them about two hours later. They tell us they gave our pizza away! Uhhh, Whut? YES THEY GAVE OUR PIZZA AWAY BECAUSE IT TURNS OUT THEY DO NOT DELIVER TO OUR NEIGHBORHOOD!!!! I guess this goes without saying but they could have told us that at the time the order was placed instead of just blowing us off and GIVING our pizza away!!! Turns out or house is two blocks from their delivery border. I guess they could have also called us after the fact to let us know. Nope - Nothing of the sort happened. I have completely lost faith in this business. When we called them to find out what was up with our order, they we're even rude to us over the phone! How is this even acceptable in this era of Yelp, Facebook, Etc????? Do NOT give this place your business! P.S. I literally wrote this review with a tear running down my cheek. Iused to love this place. Sadly is has fallen by the wayside. I had seen this coming. Management and staff seem to be perpetually stoned/drunk and they no longer give a shit about customers. So sad......Best of luck to you Pequod's..Buhbye!
