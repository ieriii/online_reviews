Worth the wait! Only complaint was our server was very short with us but it was really busy - Friday night. The additional support waitstaff made up for his attitude because they were super attentive and brought new plates, forks, etc. for each new dish. Food is great. So many options and everything comes out fresh with great timing for tapas style. My boyfriend and I ordered a salad, a chicken dish, a pasta dish and a pizza flat bread. We were able to try everything and didn't leave totally stuffed and uncomfortable :)
