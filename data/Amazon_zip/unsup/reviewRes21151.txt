I had a fine time here for dinner last weekend. There was no wait at 7 on a Saturday so that was a nice surprise. This was my first time here and it didn't really have the wow! factor for me, but was a fine place to eat fairly good Mexican food. We ordered margaritas which were very strong and not too sugary. For an appetizer we got the jalepeno poppers, which were crispy and just the right spiciness. I ordered the chicken enchiladas with green sauce which was a little too hot for my liking; luckily I had ordered mole sauce on the side. My friend said his quesadilla was really good.  Diverse group of people and adequate service. I'd come back for the location and margaritas.
