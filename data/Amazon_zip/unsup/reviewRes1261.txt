I probably ate like a sumo wrestler after a match after waiting in line for 1.5 hours. Between the 3 of us, we ordered 5 sausages and 2 baskets of duck fat rendered fries. Umm.... AMAZING. I heart fries and I heart duck fat rendered fries more. We need more meat that taste like duck and not like chicken. Given that this place only makes sausages, I feel like they could've done better with the chicken sausage. It was chewy and dry.
