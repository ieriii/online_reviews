I really like the food at Mia Francesca. I am not as much a fan of the atmosphere but for the most part I am a fan. I have to say that they do a great job accomodating special requests...for instance, every time I go I ask for penne pasta in their creamy tomato vodka sauce, with sausage and goat cheese on top. Amazing. And they will always make it for me.
