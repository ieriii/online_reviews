Open your effin' wallet and enjoy yourself. It's a celebration! I dare you - make that double dog dare you - to find a better beer selection in this city. Please. Do it. I've eaten here once and it wasn't earth-shaking, but I'm writing this review on the basis of the pub. On Friday nights, you can walk in and see literati and other thinking folks drinking, talking, philosophizing. It is often packed, but that's because it draws people. I can't say the staff is the friendliest, or the bathrooms the cleanest, but if you like beer and a crowd of likable people. Check out hopleaf! 4 stars
