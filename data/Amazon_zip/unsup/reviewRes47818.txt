This my new favorite place! I loved being here and it was a great way to celebrate one my dearest friends birthdays. I was very warmly greeted by the very handsome host THOMAS, who offered to take my coat and found my friends for me. We sat by one of the fire places in the bar/lounge. Beautiful interior, very open, high ceilings, mostly natural wood and brick. Reminded me of a place in Colorado. Every detail was well thought out and well placed, no expense spared. Great service, we had three people taking care of us, couldn't ask for better service. Great drinks, we only had appetizers, great presentation and enjoyed the American/ethnic fusion idea. The crowd was very nice. Perfect place for a single person. It was nice NOT to see any of the Viagra triangle patrons. The best feature, even though we were one of the last people to leave, Thomas was still there taking great care of us, making sure we got our coats and cars from the valet. I am looking forward to spending my next visit at the roof deck which I heard so much about the whole evening! Nice place, upscale without being stuffy or pretentious. And if you are single, perfect place to be on a Friday night. Have fun!
