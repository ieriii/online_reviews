I had their summer sizzler special (3 course pre-fixe menu for $20) and thought it was decent. I ordered the bruschetta for the appetizer, the kinzie cut for the entree, and the chocolate cake for dessert. The bruschetta was tasty and the chocolate dessert was delicious. I was disappointed however with the kinzie cut. It was an 8 oz piece of steak and I had ordered it medium like I always do. However, I thought it was a bit drier than usual. My girlfirend also did the pre-fixe menu but ordere the chicken and risotto which looked a lot tastier than my steak and julienne fries. Service was great and our table area was intimate and clean. We had an early dinner so noise-wise, it was great. When more people started arriving, the ambiance picked up but we could still talk to each other instead of talking louder. Overall, it was a nice dinner but I won't order the kinzie cut again. I'd suggest upgrading your cut, if you decide to order steak.
