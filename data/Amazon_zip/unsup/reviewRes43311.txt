Small dining room for about 30. Great to grab a bite with a friend, Not good for large parties. Love the self serve water station and coffee refills. This place reminds me of something you'd see in NYC. You order at the counter, get a number, sit, and they bring the food out to you. No waiter service. Had the Orange Brioche French toast, and it was delectable. Hip place
