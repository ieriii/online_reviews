This is a great place to take your visitors when in town! The decor really has a WOW factor and the food is very tasty. It's a latin fusion kind of place so if you only eat the same foods that you ate when you were 5 (hamburgers, hotdogs, chicken fingers, spaghetti) then you should skip but otherwise definitely go. The decor alone is worth seeing but the food is really good too!
