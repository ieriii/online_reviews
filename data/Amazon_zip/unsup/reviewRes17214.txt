Absolutely outstanding! You know a restaraunt is good when your waiter basically orders the most spectaculor food for you, making effortless to eat & drink! The tapas style menu is one of my favs & the mojitos were just classic, which for me is a tall order. Of course who could resist afterwards a salsa band. They'll be seeing me in june!
