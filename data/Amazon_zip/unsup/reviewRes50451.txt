Text message during a boring meeting: "Do you like fried chicken?" I hide my phone under the table and surreptitiously look around to make sure no one is noticing before I text back: "Yes. When? Where?" And as I waited for the response, my mouth watered with the thought. "Big Jones. Tuesdays". And with that as my invite- I headed north to try out this southern eating place that I had first been introduced to at the Yelp Fantasea event. The simple interior reminded me of a soda shop- cute little tables and chairs that made for a comfortable, casual feeling. We lucked out and got a table right in the front window so I could watch people walk by on this cool Spring evening. We started with the fried green tomatoes which were quite good- topped with pickled shrimp and roumelade sauce. And then the chicken came out with mashed potatoes and greens. While it was good- the chicken was a little salty for me. The better choice at our table? The pulled pork sandwich topped with slaw and served with a side of fried okra. Delicious! We washed it all down with a PBR (or two) and just sat and relaxed like we had just eaten a Thanksgiving dinner. Service was just okay on the night we were there. Our server was a bit distracted, didn't list any specials for us (although we heard her do it at the other tables) and we had to flag her down to get a drink refill and our bill. We actually ended up taking our bill to the bar manager to get it paid since she never came back. An off night? I don't know. Parking is easy in this area (try one of the side streets- the meters stop at 6) Text message on way home: "You gonna Yelp this?" Me: "Yep"
