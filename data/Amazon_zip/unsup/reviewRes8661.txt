A meat lovers paradise is all I can say to describe Fogo de Chao. My friend and I went here last night and it was just an all around good experience. First of all, we were an hour late due to traffic and they still held our table for us. They had one of the most amazing salad bars I have ever seen. I wish I had one of those bottomless stomachs, because I would have loved to have tried everything on it. There was everything from veggies, to fresh cheeses, to pasta salads. My friend warned me though that was nothing compared to what was next and that I should go light with the salad. You are then given this card, red means stop green means bring it on!! I must warn you though, when you do decide to turn your card to green, be prepared to be swarmed. I mean it was seriously like a contest to see how fast you could flip your card back to red before they would stop coming over. There were several selections of meat. I would have to say that my favorite was the parmesan crusted pork. Our waiter was very attentive. My water glass never went empty. The manager also was over to check on us a few times. At one point he asked us if there was anything we hadn't tried yet and we said pork. Within a minute we had 5 different servers at our table with different types of pork. It was crazy. Some people would say it is a lot of money, but $50 for all you can eat, really isn't that bad considering what you are eating. Obviously, I highly recommend this place.
