First time going to Pequods. I have been a big fan of Lou Malnotis, so I was a little critical at first. Well, I have to say, Pequods does do the key deep dish things right. One, the toppings are great. We have pepperoni, Sausage, green peppers, and onions. The sauce was bland, but let the toppings really shine out. They also do this awesome thing with the cheese all the way to the edge of the crust. This is really the best part. Good service, but just like any deep dish it takes a while to cook. Be patient, its worth it.
