Delicious food! Beautiful dining room! Great service! This is a special restaurant that really does the whole 'small plate thing' really well. Attention to detail and flavor are in every bite and after several visits here, I have yet to find anything not up to par. I am not a seafood eater and the Chef always takes that into accomodation when creating my experience. We go every year to celebrate our anniversary and enjoy a wonderful Cava and really celebrate a great meal... This is a very authentic Catalan restaurant in a city that does'nt have many options in that genre.
