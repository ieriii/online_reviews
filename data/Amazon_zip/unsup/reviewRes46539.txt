Someone gave me a gift certificate to a Lettuce Entertain You restaurant for my birthday and we decided on this joint. My friend hyped up the salad bar so that is what I ordered. Eh, it was okay. I thought it was a bit crowded and messy and really I can think of a few other places with more crave-worthy bars.  As far as atmosphere: Crowded and too many kids. I cannot stand those little snot-nosed brats, especially when I am having dinner. So maybe this was a bad choice for us..but what did I know?  Too kitschy for me.
