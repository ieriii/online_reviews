Had a drink at the back bar...great space.  Their bone marrow is the best I've had. Tartar with quail egg and horseradish foam...bright, fresh, gorgeous. Their foi gras preparation is outstanding and left nothing to be desired. Waitress was well informed and non intrusive. I god damned love this place!
