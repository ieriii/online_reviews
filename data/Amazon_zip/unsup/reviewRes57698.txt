I was never a big fan of Mexican food, but I'm a fan of Nuevo Leon. The moment you sit down freshly fried tortillas and two different variety of home made salsas are served, a fantastic start. They have the best tacos I've ever had bar none and it's called Tacos Daniel. This is an authentic version that is not on the menu consisting of seasoned beef rib meat, cilantro, and guacamole (optional) on a soft tortilla. I like adding their salsa to my tacos which really complements its flavor. In addition, Chicken Tinga, tamales, and banilla cheese is a must try.Stay away from the beef fajitas, the beef can be quite tough, good for a good headache from chewing so hard. Service is just adequate, but then again this is a modestly priced casual restaurant so don't expect too much in that area. Nuevo Leon has a BYOB policy so come prepared by visiting the liquor store couple doors away. Another important tip would be to make certain you have a private mode of transportation because it's almost impossible to catch a cab once your there. In addition, I was told the area can be somewhat less than safe to stand around especially during the evening. Parking is accomodated on a lot across the street and it's free as long as your ticket is validated.For athentic Mexican food this place is a must. I thoroughly enjoyed this place and recommend it
