My dad is a fan of gangster history so for father's day we tried to take him here. There is ALWAYS a cover...to add to that the guy at the door was trying to charge us more than the posted cover on the website! I must say, it's kind of sad that a place that has so much infamous history now hosts a weekly poetry slam. Al Capone should be rolling in his grave. We'll probably try to stop back earlier in the day the next time my dad is in town. Overall very disappointed. I'll give it 3 stars just because they're still around, in fairly original condition, and they have a great history (even if that can't be attributed to the current owners/employees). I hear the music is good...but from what I heard of the poetry I'd avoid this place on Sundays.
