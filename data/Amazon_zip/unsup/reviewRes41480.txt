I'd give Tank 5 stars but i haven't been in Chi-town long enough to say that it is mos def THE BEST noodle house. For the week that i've been here, i will say that it is the most satisfying meal i've had in a looong time. The ambience is chill, with easy listening favorites similar to Cali tunes from the mid-90s [ya know, the songs you don't really want to admit to knowing the words to but LOVE singing behind closed doors]. The Service is prompt and friendly, and the food, ABSOLUTELY De-lish! I had the fish noodle soup - you can tell they put time and lotsa flavor into the broth + the claypot catfish - the flesh slid off the meat and literally melted in your mouth. Take it from the Asian, this is a MUST visit!
