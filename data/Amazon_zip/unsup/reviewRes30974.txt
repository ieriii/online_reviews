More than anything, you come to Sunda not to eat, but to be seen eating. Talk about a scene. I was fortunate enough to eat outside, because if you get stuck inside, I hope your mime skills are up to par. Loud. Loud. LOUD. But I think that's the point? I digress....on to the food. In general, Sunda's sushi is fresh, but I've certainly had better rolls in the city (shout out Toro) and for far cheaper. But if you are to go here, I would try the Stuffed Tuna and "Tail of Two Tunes." Surprisingly, the best thing I ate here was a salad - the crispy brussel sprout salad.  I would go back, but never on my own dime. Dinner date, Billy Dec?
