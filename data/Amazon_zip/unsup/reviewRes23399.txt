Oh, man. So delicious. Erik had a crepe with Brie and apricot preserves. It was heaven. Ryan had some concoction (his own) involving olive tapenade, dates, almonds, grapeseed oil, mixed greens and god knows what else, but he's a foodie and a chef so it was probably delicious. I had the Icosium crepe (goat cheese, pine nuts, tomatoes, caramelized onion, roasted peppers, fresh spinach)-- light and decadent all at once. The goat cheese they use is perfectly creamy and flavorful, without being overpowering. The accompanying veggie puree soup with its mint-leaf garnish was lovely and subtle all on its own, but with a dollop of the spicy tapenade offered alongside-- dynamite! Yeah, the service is, um, langorous... but --as with Ras Dashen, my fave Ethiopian place-- if you know ahead of time that it's going to be lugubrious in the service dept., it probably won't be as bothersome as when you need some Turkish coffee for your Sunday-afternoon hangover and it comes a full 20 mintues after you've been seated. The guys were more bothered than I was, though, because I was too busy trying to figure out how to get myself one of those fabu lamps they have.
