Num Num in my Tum Tum. Yes, I wrote that. It took me a couple try's to like this place. But once I did, I fell in love. Great dishes. Great options. And they treat vegetarians and vegans like real people. I especially love the gyros and the sweet potato fries and their "tease" sticks (vegan cheese sticks). And their vegan shakes ain't half bad.
