Even if you're not feeling the strong drinks (some of them prepped at your table), the food is incredible. I'm not from San Fran like Ed M., so maybe I'm just a Chicagoan with no taste, but I really liked everything I ate at Frontera. The portions are small and the prices are high, so it's not somewhere I'll be dining frequently. But it's good for birthday parties or anniversaries or things like that.  When we there, Rick B himself stopped by our table and asked us how the drinks were. He then went into a typical (-ly awesome) semi-raspy speech about how everything was so freakin' authentic/fresh/imported it makes you want to kill him for being such a kook. A tip: If the restaurant is full and there's a long wait, check out the bar area. There's a bunch of seating there and I was able to get in with a group of 8 people with no wait over there. The food is the same, and you're closer to the bar!
