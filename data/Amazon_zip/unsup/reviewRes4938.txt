My first lunch during my first (of many) vacation to Chicago. What a delightful choice!!! Slightly off to the side of Michigan Avenue lies The Purple Pig. I came on a Wednesday afternoon and it wasn't busy. We got seats right away... also it was pouring outside. So maybe that's why people didn't venture in. The waitress was very hospitable and she had such wonderful suggestions as to what to eat and what to drink. THE ROASTED BONE MARROW is to die for! I have never tried such a dish and I am so glad that I did at PURPLE PIG! Two delightful bones came with capers, herbs and sea salt. Smear that bone marrow on the crispy, buttery bread... sprinkle some sea salt and top it with capers! HEAVEN! SERIOUSLY! HEAVEN! I tried to go there two more times during my visit, but the wait was CRAZY! I went during dinner time. The wait was about an hour to an hour and a half. Sad to say, I wasn't able to get my last fix of bone marrow. (The other stuff was good too but the bone marrow was good. Try the CRISPY PIG EARS WITH KALE. My second favorite dish) The pricing was reasonable too. PLUS!
