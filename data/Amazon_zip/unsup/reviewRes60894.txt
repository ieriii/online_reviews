Dinner at Zed may have been one of the most delicious meal yet this year. The food is seriously as good as it gets. To start they have this incredible rustic harvest bar (it makes you want to go to Italy and hug a grandmother) and then me ordered the most amazing meats, life changing, from fish to steak. I know, this combination on the same table doesn't seem appropriate!? But Zed, how you make it work, I do not know, but I thank you. I ate a potato salad that was so rich and so light all at once, I was in sheer delight with each bite. The cheese plates sealed the finish, now thats the ticket! Best ever. We had dessert topped not with a cherry but bananas!! The staff was great and worked with us to make a very personalized and special dinner. The atmosphere is both intimate and social. It is a perfect punctuation to any day in the city, or a when you really want to love your food.
