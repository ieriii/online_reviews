Had dinner with an out-of-town friend here late on a Friday night (in truth, because I had forgotten to make reservations more than a couple days in advance and couldn't get in to some of the hotter places - he wanted a foodie experience).The prix fixe menu is great - $60 for 3 course, plus intervening mini courses. I must immediately add that the cheese course that was comprised of a grilled cheese sandwich with those lacy cheese crackers on the outside was much much too heavy to be served between the main course and dessert. We were both a little disgusted and overwhelmed. The beer pairing served with it was nice, but a little out of place, just like the whole cheese thing. I mean, grilled cheese is just really heavy.But back on track...we had a great meal, the service was excellent, very responsive. I had the frog to start, the short rib for my main, and banana for the dessrt. All were great, although my favorite were the short ribs, which were served like grated carrots, which made them all the more delicious. The frog legs were coated and fried, which was okay, but I would have preferred something less heavy. Generally enjoyed it but definitely not a place I need to go back to. I might go back for something casual, but it's not so much a food experience as I had hoped (and as had been suggested). For me it was trying a little hard to be like that when really it was just a good restaurant. The room is a little small and while I understood being asked to wait at the bar until my eating companion arrived, it was uncomfortable as the stools were quite high and very close to the tables and, honestly, we were the last seating and our table was empty...Oh and FYI that currently (at least as of last week) there is massive construction outside, such that you can't see the facade of the building and it's hard to tell that there is an operating business unless you are basically in front of it.
