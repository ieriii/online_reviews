Guys this place doesnt even deserve 1 star. We got 2 different salsa, chips and chicken soup as soon as we sat down. 1 salsa was bland and the other tasted funny (I still can't pinpoint the flavor, it might be of rancid water). The chicken soup was ok, bland as well. I ordered the ENCHILADAS SUIZAS for my main which came with the usual beans and rice. The rice tasted of freezer burn , my enchiladas was smothered in cheese and flavorless. My friend tried my beans and said "beans are not supposed to taste like that". She ordered 3 steak tacos which she said were ok. My best advice - go elsewhere.
