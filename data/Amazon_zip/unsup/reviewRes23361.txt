SAGANAKI!!!! OPA! How exciting! Who doesn't like flaming cheese!? And I love their "family Style Dinner", which is like a course that offers a lot of small dishes. It's great because you don't have to be in a big group to enjoy a variety of food (for 2 or more people). Or you can create your own combination and order the 1/2 portions. I'm not too familiar with Greek food but I'm biased toward anything octopus, eggplant, and lamb. And this is a great restaurant to try out new ways to prepare (eat) them. OH! And did I mention the free parking?
