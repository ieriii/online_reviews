I always have a pleasant experience at Chicago Diner. The staff is super friendly and almost everything I have tried is tasty. My newest favorite is the firehouse chipotle chicken wrap or something to that effect. The reuben is excellent as well! I also love the buffalo seitan appetizer. It seems to have improved recently. It was always good but it was extra crispy the last time I had it. The vegan desserts here are also outstanding. I recommend the cheesecake and the tiramisu cupcake! Can't wait to return!
