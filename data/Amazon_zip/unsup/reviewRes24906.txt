Delicious.  I went to UIC and came here all the time. I have never once had a bad experience. Everyone there is super friendly and it's a welcoming open and airy space to sit for a bit and eat. The food is always fresh and consistently tasty. And very reasonably priced. And the desserts? Girl, don't get me started. I have never said no to going here. Ever. Awesome.
