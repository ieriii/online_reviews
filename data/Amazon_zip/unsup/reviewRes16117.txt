Besides the silliness of the 'unmarked' entrance, no phone number and strict door policy when there is a line, this is a wonderful place to enjoy a divine cocktail or four. The room is split into three sections by heavy, velvet curtains and the tables offer an enormous amount of privacy if one wishes. The bar seating is quite comfortable as well and to be honest, watching the bar staff make the drinks is half the fun. I went with a friend and had one of the bartenders guide us through the drinks, all of which were excellent. In regards to food, we ordered the pickle chips, deviled eggs, duck meatballs and the peanut butter sandwich. The standouts were the pickles and the meatballs - yum! I didn't find the atmosphere to be pretentious at all and found the servers to be exceptionally helpful and friendly. The crowd varied in age and offered a nice change from the typical bar scene. Go, enjoy a delicious drink and chill out. Chicago is lucky to have Violet Hour.
