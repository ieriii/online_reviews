Blahh! I was looking forward to a new place in the hood to take my money and feed me so I was very disappointed that this place couldn't keep me interested in anything they offered. On a Friday evening, 3 of us looking for food and beer walked into the front door to this trendy, upscale-ish bar playing horrible clubbing music to a cliental that looked a bit trendy and hip for the usual folks in the neighborhood. We found a table in the very dimly lit backroom which had a completely different ambiance than the other part of the bar. We all agreed that it sort of had someone's parent's basement that they turned into a recreation room in the 80's type feel. It had exposed brick, wood beam ceiling with material draped between, foosball, Pac Man and pinball. The bathroom back there also had a hand painted mural of an orchard of bad apples that seemed it should have belonged in a kindergarten toilet. It was such a decorating mess that we couldn't feel comfortable and instead just kept commenting on how odd it was.  The beer list was very good but not excellent like some have said and the beer is the only thing that may have me come back, if I ever do. The food was not quiet average on the verge of below average. We got 2 of their expensive fancy burgers and were underwhelmed. They sounded really good on the menu but it didn't deliver in reality. For the amount of toppings on a burger, it lacked great, complex flavor. It was like someone already chewed the burger and took out the flavor. The girl from Wisconsin got the cheese nuggets/curds. What a way to upset a Cheesehead! They were vastly expensive for about 6 measly, flavorless curds that resemble nothing that one would get at the state fair. We were all so disappointed from the food that we almost had to go to the Jewel next door and eat a package of Oreos to recalibrate our palates.
