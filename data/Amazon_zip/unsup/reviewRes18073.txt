This is hands-down my favorite Italian restaurant in Chicago. It's probably under the radar for most people, but it's a very popular spot in the neighborhood, with good reason. First, and most importantly, the food is fantastic. I've been here a handful of times, and every pasta dish I've enjoyed has been outstanding, most recently their spinach gnocchi quattro formaggi dish, in which the ghocchi's are stuffed with pesto in a delicious creamy cheese sauce. Throw in some chicken, and, ummhmm, I was good to go. You can't go wrong with their pasta selections, they are phenomial and a real treat for this guy. Another thing that puts Caro Mio over the top for me is the ambiance of the place. It's got an intimate setting, with cool artwork on the walls, and a lively atmosphere. Lots of good conversation, good people, a good date spot. Oh, and it's BYOB too, which is always an added bonus. Their waitstaff is also very efficient, knowledgeable/helpful, friendly, and overall on top of it. So the food is the main selling point, it never dissappoints. Throw in the atmosphere, great service, BYOB, and you've got my personal favorite Italian restaurant in the Chi.
