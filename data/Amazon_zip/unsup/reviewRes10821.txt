I had dinner here with the owner, his brother and a mutual friend, so I guess I better tip toe lightly through this, eh? And this is about my sixth visit to Piece. As a former New Haven resident, like the Jacobs Bros., I enjoy that thin crust pizza, and I like the ability to have clams and white sauce as a topping. The boys chose one of those (clam and bacon), and one half red pepperoni and banana peppers/bacon/tomato/onion. All good choices. We all shared a salad of mixed greens, red onion, crumbled goat cheese and apples. With a light dressing, this made for a light and appetizing starter. I have always come here when I had out-of-town visitors, visiting Siebel brewing students, or for the live karaoke. Big, busy and boisterous, you are sure to impress your cousins from Iowa after an afternoon stroll through the artsy-fartsy, indie shops and streets of Wicker Park. They always have a good choice of house beers and ales, as well as other bottled choices, if you need that special well-known label to wash down the fresh and tasty pizza. The young and enthusiastic staff here has always been for me very helpful and attentive. And that was the case on our Tuesday night visit. The place was packed by 6:30 on a weeknight, so it doesn't hurt to arrive early or later in the evening if you're not a fan of long waits. Piece has been for me a good memory-making spot, coming with a small and special group to share that simple college kid staple of beer and pizza. Talk and late revelations of our times at Hamden Hall Country Day School. Stuff of reunions and catching up after 30 years. And I got to take home the left-overs. Here I come, cold pizza and Pepsi. Move over, box of granola!
