Went here with the boyfriend & folks on a Sunday evening. Started with drinks in the lounge at 6. A live latin band was playing there. Then at 7 we moved to the lounge for dinner. The menu was extensive. Our server was young and VERY perky and chatty. Portions were fairly large. We had the Empanada appetizer. DELISH! A tad small for 4 people. I had the Chuleta entree, and that was very good too. The fufu side was just ok. Bit of a strange consistency. Runnier than mashed potatoes. The yucca that came with my boyfriend's entree was fantastic! We will go back again. Their out front patio/ deck is really great and the view of the freeway is surprisingly exciting.
