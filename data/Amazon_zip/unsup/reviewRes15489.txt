Definitely a top notch place, the only downfall may be the line to get in but once you're past that it's well worth the wait. The seating is arranged to make almost every area it's own private place. The drinks are pricier than you might expect but think of it as a two for one deal because they're also stronger than you'd expect! An all around amazing place.
