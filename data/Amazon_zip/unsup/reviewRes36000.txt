I'm a big fan of the benedict-format breakfast. It covers all the essential food groups in one dish: carbs, protein, and hollandaise. The hot-smoked salmon benedict at Meli Cafe was delicious, and you can cancel out all those calories by accompanying it with a fresh juice with wheatgrass, the antimatter to hollandaise. The menu is really interesting, and there wasn't anything on there I wouldn't like to try. I haven't explored Greektown much, but this is definitely a reason to return.
