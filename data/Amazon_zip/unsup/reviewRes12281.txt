The other night I went to Piece Pizza for a Boston University Alumni planning meeting. It was probably my 4th or 5th time at Piece since I have lived in Chicago and it seriously never disappoints. They have a crazy good selection of their own micro-brewed brewskies and classy stylish imports. For old times' sake, I started off the night with a Strongbow cider but then moved on to the Top Heavy Hefeweizen, a beer that brought me back to my beer-filled days in glorious Munchen, Germany. The restaurant is at a great location in Wicker Park, at the corner of the Damen/Milwaukee/North Aves intersection. I arrived at around 6PM to a nearly empty place but by 8PM, the whole room was full and bustling. BU Alumni events are often held there because of the owner's own alumnus status. Winters are for watching the BU Terriers kill their competition in the Bean Pot, a phenomenon not usually experienced by midwesterners. The ambience is convivial, the pizza is out of this world, and the beer...oh the beer. They do sell growlers of their home brews and it seems that next time, I'll have to buy my own supply of the Top Heavy. I might be down soon to catch one of the Bears games they play every weekend!
