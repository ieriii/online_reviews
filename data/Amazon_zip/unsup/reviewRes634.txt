if i could give alinea more than 5 stars, i totally would. but alas, that is not an option. this review is long overdue. i came here with a close friend for my birthday last year (october 2008), and it was beyond all my expectations. and really it's beyond anything i can describe. yes it's very expensive but it's one of those things that if you have the money, i definitely recommend trying because it is such an experience. from the moment i walked in the door, everyone was attentive and there to make my experience an amazing one. the food was more than wonderful and more than just a meal. all the wine pairings were spot on as well. we did the 12 course and left pretty full but not so full we needed to be rolled out the door. grant achatz signed our menus at the end of the night, and that's going on my wall!
