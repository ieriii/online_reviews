As a far northsider who used to trek to Wrigleyville for Uncommon Ground's brunch, I was excited when this second location opened. This place has a lot to offer--an interesting menu that specializes in seasonal, local ingredients, good service, a nice bar, and live music. It gets crowded on the weekend, but they do take reservations. I've been here close to a dozen times, and while the specials are pretty much always on point, I do find myself coming back to the same few menu staples. For dinner you can't beat the sweet potato fries with goat cheese fondue, the bacon-wrapped meatloaf, or on Fridays, my all-time Uncommon Ground favorite, the fish fry. The generous portion (though not all-you-can-eat) of beer-battered fish is made that much better by the accompanying 312 on tap and on special. For brunch, the seasonal scrambles and skillets are a sure bet. If you're feeling indulgent ($- and food-wise), you can't go wrong with a side of the peppercorn bacon. I've never had bad service here. The servers are knowledgeable and attentive. My only complaint is that, unless I'm sticking to the fish fry and a pint of 312, the bill can get pretty steep for a shared appetizer, an entree, and a drink (I'm usually too full for dessert, but the black dog gelato & sorbet trio is delicious).
