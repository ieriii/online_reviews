Let's just say that I've been here twice in the past week. Once for a dinner on Tue and the other for Lunch on Mon. Both times I left happy and stuffed. I've been prolly 4 times so far this year. Everything is so good, its hard to hold back and not eat it all. Here is what I've had so far and recommend: Chips (Fries) Curry Gravy Mussels Vindaloo, Toast (ask for extra bread as the sauce is good enough you may be temped to drink it instead) Seared New Bedford Sea Scallops Sweet Potato, Vanilla, Chorizo Vinaigrette - good although I wish the chorizo was a bit thicker and less wafer thin as you couldn't taste it "The Gage" USDA Prime Burger Local Camembert, Melted Onion Marmalade, Toasted Malt Roll - great burger, though a little hard. Onions and cheese made the burger. Today's Fish and Chips Guinness Batter, Malt Tartar Sauce, Lemon - signature dish...so good. I think I've had this 2/4 times I've been here. Potato Soup Smoked Bacon, Clams - very tastey...though I got it a while ago and cannot remember the particulars. Sandwich of the Day (a samo with pork and an awesome chese) Slow Roasted Beef Brisket Steiner Swiss, Melted Onion, Mustard, Brioche - best brisket samo I've had in a long time. It also was huge!!
