Are the hot dogs good? Yes. Was it worth the hour and a half wait in line? No.  Hot Doug's has some really good, unique hot dogs, but they aren't good enough to make me forget about the wait. The Chicago dog really wasn't anything remarkable, and the specialty dogs are good, but no better than a place like Franks 'n Dawgs, where I've never waited more than 5 minutes. I think if one waits in a line for this long, anything they eat is going to taste fantastic.
