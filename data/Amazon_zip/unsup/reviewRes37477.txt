I have very mixed feelings about Fox & Obel.  For prepared foods, Fox & Obel is fairly stellar. And their cheese selection is not only quite large, the cheese "staff" will ensure that you pick the most amazing cheese combination for your next party.  That said, however, Fox & Obel falls very low on my list if you like to cook (as I do).  I've encountered moldy produce (specialty items: shallots, arugula, leeks, fingerling potatoes, etc.) time after time. Their meat department, while always very clean, is not well stocked/run out of specialty items: rabbit, pheasant, goose, chicken livers, standing rib roast, etc.  The fish looks amazing, but I've pointed out dead lobsters in the tank twice now.  The dry goods, while very intriguing, are also limited in selection (no sushi rice, no pearl pasta, etc. etc.) What bugs me about all of this is that Fox & Obel has placed THEMSELVES on this pedestal of gourmet food selection -- and I found them to be lacking time and time again. To be honest, Whole Foods is a lot better and its just a few blocks over.  These days I go to Whole Foods to do the bulk of my shopping, to specialty shops (the Spice House, Oil and Vinegar, etc.) for my truly difficult and "snooty" items, and Fox & Obel for the cheese.
