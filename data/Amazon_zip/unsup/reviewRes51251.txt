Garcia's has pretty decent food but you get what you are paying for and with their prices its pretty good. No you are not gonna get home made authentic tasting Mexican food, this isn't someones house, its a restaurant but it is still a lot better than most large scale establishments. The wait staff is usually pretty good unless it is super packed. If you are looking for a quiet dinner this is not the place to go... Its loud its fun and if you are crotchety and don't like people laughing and having a good time go somewhere else. The outdoor patio is also really nice especially during the summer. Quick summary: Great place to sit down outside or at the bar have a few margaritas, modelos and some appetizers.
