Daughter treated us here for Sunday brunch. It was an ok place to try. Overall, it was pricey and very loud, but you do get served fresh ingredients. A $4 cappuccino was tiny (smallest to date from anywhere). The complimentary fresh, powdered beignets were nice, and heavier and more doughy than those served at Cafe du Monde in NO. I had a $14 catfish and grits, and the catfish was fresh, but it was small, and on the surprisingly bland side. Wife had fried green tomatoes and eggs benedict that she liked. I had a taste and it was a litle tangy for my taste. Overall, it looks like a nice and vibrant place to be seen in Andersonville. I probably won't be back for brunch though, as there are others to try.
