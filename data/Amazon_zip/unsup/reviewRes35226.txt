There's two rooms here: the quieter dining room to the left as you walk in, and the noisier, casual barroom-style with live music on the right. I recommend the latter - counter seating, watching the guys shuck oysters. We came to watch our buddies playing - next time they're back, we'll go again. But probably skipping the food (disappointing) and just order drinks, clam chowder and dessert. That would be a 4 star experience, so that's how I rated this review, since we really enjoyed the live music, the kitschy decor, and the prompt and friendly waitress. Based on some of the other reviews, I may even give the mains a second chance - crab legs or lobster boil. The food itself was just 3 stars, bordering on not good at all, especially for that price. We started with the oyster sampler, and someone needs a shucking brushup - shell pieces in every single one! I had the combo dish with a crabcake, shrimp, and scallops, all of which had weird textures and were all obviously not fresh. The crabcake - nicely crisp outside, but it wasn't cooked long enough for its thickness, so the middle was mealy, pasty and cold. The rice side was tasteless and mushy. Our friends split a fish special, and that looked decent. They also got sushi here (!?!) and would not get it again. The desserts were all very good - we got a sampler with 4 different mini samples, and that raspberry pie was especially noteworthy. Highly recommended.
