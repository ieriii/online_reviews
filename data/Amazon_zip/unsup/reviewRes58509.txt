To be fair, we cannot comment on the food, because we never got this far. Front staff and experience trying to visit was very disappointing. Stopped in on a Saturday (looking ahead online to see that they do NOT take reservations). The person ahead of us was told that his wait would be 45 minutes. We were told that our party of 3 would be a at least and hour and a half (and that they do take limited reservations, unlike the online profile). We left a phone number to be called if we left the building, then made the decision that an hour and a half was too long (considering the many empty tables we saw) and left catching a cab back to our parking garage. 12 minutes later, yes 12 minutes later we were called. No I could not answer it on the first ring because I was in a parking garage where cell phones go to die. Called back to find out that a table was ready and was chastised for not answering my phone soon enough by the hostess. She explained that when they call people, many leave and don't come back so they just go to the next name on the list, and somehow an hour and a half of people failed to respond, thus she called us. NOW....the words at least and hour and a half are not the same as a rational explanation of how this system works and that there is a likely chance that it would not be that long. We would have stayed if the wait might have been reasonable. Having been a hostess, I know that they always error on the positive side for times as they don't want you to leave and take your business somewhere else. At least and hour and a half (with this system in place) says....you know what?....go somewhere else. The attitude of the hostess was arrogant. Really glad we drove in from the burbs and walked 12 blocks in the heat to try to attend for the first time. This experience left a very bad taste in our mouth....no idea if the food would do the same thing.
