I think this hotel is gorgeous, and the reason it got three stars (instead of two) is its location. I spent a few nights here with my mom for her birthday and we left our car at the hotel, easily walking around the best parts of Chicago and seeing the city the best way. However, I do think the rooms are on the small and simple side for the money you're paying.
