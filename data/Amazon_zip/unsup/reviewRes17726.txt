Personally, I don't think the Violet Hour is all that it is hyped up to be. I heard many rave reviews prior to first going - and when I arrived, I realized that it is a little too pretentious for my taste. I am not a huge fan of waiting and big crowds to get into places, and for the idea behind this bar, I think it would be so much more intimate and Violet-Hour-esque if they did not cram a bunch of those tall individual booths in the middle of the floor. It seems rather crammed. It takes FOREVER to get drinks here - every time I've come (3 times now), but I guess I've ended up saving money in the long run, because I can't get the attention of our server to get another drink. This is not to bash on the serving staff - they seem friendly and knowledgeable enough - but each time I've come - it looks like one girl takes the whole floor SOLO. So naturally she is forced to run around like crazy and not devote the necessary attention to each table. I was expected an intimate experience with a very attentive server from the theme this bar promotes. Have not yet gotten any of that. The drinks are tasty - and there is quite a selection - but it's just not worth it to me, unless there's some secret day where no one is there and I can go and get all the attention in the world.
