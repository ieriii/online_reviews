We got to go back recently and had the Skirt Steak. A very delicious preparation. What I would suggest to people who go as a couple: Order delicious drinks, an appetizer, share a main entree (they are big), and a dessert, and another drink or two. We went on a Saturday early evening and they were busy, but the wait staff did a great job keeping up with us and making sure we were happy.
