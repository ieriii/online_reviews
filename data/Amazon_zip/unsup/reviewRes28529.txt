I'll keep this short. I can't really add much to all the previous reviews. I love this place. I'm probably a bit biased, I love all of the Frontera products at my local grocery store, and I love Rick's TV shows. The food was great, authentic, but with a Rick Bayless kick. I'm sick of Americanized Mexican food, it's always quantity over quality. Just say no to tacos, burritos, chimichangas with rice and beans. Lets support places that have real variety and flavor.
