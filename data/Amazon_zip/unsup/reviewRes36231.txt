I just tried this place tonight, ordering food for takeout. Overall, I had a good experience, which surprised me, given some of the negative reviews this place has received, especially concerning its service. The service was very friendly, even service with a smile, and I received my to-go order rather quickly. I ordered the ginger chicken and it was quite good, although I would have preferred a slightly stronger ginger flavor to the sauce, but the ingredients were definitely fresh. I would certainly order from them again. The restaurant itself is beautifully decorated, and so I would be happy to dine-in one day and enjoy the food along with the atmosphere.
