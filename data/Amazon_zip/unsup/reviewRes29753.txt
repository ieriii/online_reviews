Don't get me wrong, I like meat, I love meat, but every once in a while you're just not feelin' like meat. Ya know? On the other hand, I'm not a fan of faux meat, but at the Chicago Diner you can hardly tell it's not meat. (I just like saying "meat") I've been here a couple times for breakfast or lunch and have enjoyed each visit. Most recently I had a day off work and was starving after a manicure near by. Their menu isn't that big, but everything looked so good that I couldn't decide, so I asked my server what he suggested and went with his favorite dish. Sometimes I just like being told what to do. I had the reuben, which had roasted peppers on it along with the regular suspects, and it was delicious. I had it with no dairy (trying to get back on the wagon) and it did not leaving me craving real cheese. The biscuits and gravy are really good too. The service is always friendly. Today I got a good dose of heavy eye contact and smiles, certainly made me feel welcome and not rushed to give up the table even though I was taking my time and reading while I enjoyed my meal.  Now that I've finally popped my Chicago Diner cherry I suspect I'll be making the short walk over here more often. I only wish they opened earlier during the week, I'm a total breakfast whore.
