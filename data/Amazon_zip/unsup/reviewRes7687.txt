This place was recommended to me by a Brazilian colleague. Delicious cuts of meat are brought around to your table until you can't possible eat anymore. Good luck trying them all, not for the light of appetite. The Brazilian cheese rolls were great. Service was excellent. My salad plate was off of the table mere seconds after I was done with it. It will be days before I recover from the meat coma but I regret nothing.
