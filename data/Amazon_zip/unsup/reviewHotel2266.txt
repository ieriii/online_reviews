I try and stay here every June for The World Trade Fair - NEOCON. It's the perfect location right on Michigan Avenue (NR Wacker) where all the shops start and right next to Nordstrom also walkable to the Merchandise Mart. The rooms are small, but comfortable for one person on a business trip for a couple of nights. Very comfortable beds and bedding. The customer service I found to be good. The AC was leaking in the floor outside the bathroom in my room and the carpet was wet. The maintenance guy was up within 10 minutes with the bell boy with rugs and asking if I wanted to switch rooms.
