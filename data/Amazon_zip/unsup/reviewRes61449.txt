This is the first BYOB Vietnamese restaurant I have been to that has a classy clean environment. The food is reasonably priced as well as very flavorful and tasty. My favorite dish there is Grilled pork and egg rolls, and for appetizer coconut shrimp . A few other good dish I had was salted pork with brown glazed sauce and fish with brown sauce (can't remember exact name without the menu). Although I was not impress with the waitress the first time I went to the restaurant, I noticed the waitress is no longer there and I can see much better service now.
