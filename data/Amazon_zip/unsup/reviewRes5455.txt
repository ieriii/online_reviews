The Purple Pig reminds me of a tapas place...in a good way. The portions are enough for a group to share and try various dishes. My group tried the octopus, prosciutto bread balls, beets w/goat cheese, pig ears, jamon serrano, chorizo stuffed olives, bone marrow, and pork shoulder. All dishes were good. The most favorite was the jamon serrano - it comes with a duck egg atop and the blend of flavors was really good. The least favorite was the beets w/goat cheese - there were too many beets and it overpowered the dish (though, if you are a beet lover you may favor this dish). On top of the food being good, the service was as well. Upon arriving, my friend and I had to wait for our party so we had a some wine at the bar. The bartender was very knowledgeable on the various wines offered and allowed us to taste prior to ordering a glass. The food came out in a timely fashion and the waitress was attentive. The tables are communal so if you do not like the idea of possibly sitting next to a stranger it's something to think about.
