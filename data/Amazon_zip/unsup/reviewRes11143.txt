Many things not to like: - very cramped quarters - non-traditional items are somewhat banal in their execution - oversized portions of these somewhat banal flavors - a shade expensive - noisy - (as of February 2007) has one of the most useless and arrogant hosts in the history of the hospitality industry - attracts a crowd that values or doesn't care about being put off by the above in short, this place differentiates its offerings from their more traditional, make-at-home variants with changes that are not particularly inspired, do not scale well to the portion sizes they like to serve, and oftentimes are not nearly inventive enough to demand a substantial premium. I have overpaid for tired-ass buckwheat pancakes for the very last time. it is, however, on my favorite street in an interesting neighborhood. however, I'd just as soon wait a bit until potbelly up the street serves lunch/opens and purchase much more honest food.
