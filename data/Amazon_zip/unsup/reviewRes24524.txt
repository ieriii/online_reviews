I too used the groupon. It is a romantic restaurant with great service. I liked the concept of 3 courses (cheese fondue, main course cooked in oil, and dessert fondue). Come hungry because I was extremely full upon leaving. Uncomfortably full. It is also quite expensive for what you get. I wonder how they get repeat customers for that price point. I shared a bottle of wine (their summer special which was good) and even with the groupon it was pricey! There are a lot of improvements that could be made to enhance an experience. #1) lighting (it was so dim I couldn't read the menu) #1a) lighting contd (if the waitress needs a flashlight to show you the raw food on your platter for cooking in the oil, they should just give everyone flashlights #3) timers (waitress says 3 min for potatoes, 1 min for shrimp, 3 min? for chicken, etc. If they are concerned about the diner cooking their food properly they should give everyone timers. It was distracting to look at my watch or phone to make sure I didn't under cook the food #4) better chocolate (I agree with other diners saying that the chocolate fondue is more like warmed hershey syrup. They need to kick this up a notch). It's fine to do 1x but we will not be going back.
