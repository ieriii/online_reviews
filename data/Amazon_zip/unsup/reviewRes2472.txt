Really good hot dogs. I don't get very adventurous and just order the regular dog. My husband always gets a specialty dog and usually enjoys it. This is the place I bring people from out of town to so that they may experience a "Chicago style" hot dog. The guys taking orders is great. I do wish they accepted credit cards.
