Such a great Sunday brunch place (also serves dinner). My bf and I take our out-of-town guests here because you really wouldn't expect to eat a Southern brunch in Chicago. There is always street parking, and there is also always a wait. But the food is great and reasonably priced. It is always fun to read through the menu just because there are items that aren't that common. I recommend the cheese grits and any of the omelettes. The hot apple cider is just perfect on a fall morning. They also serve alcoholic drinks in the AM! Oops.. this review was meant for the West Loop location near Harpo Studios. :)
