Have always wanted to visit Carnivale because it got such GREAT reviews on Yelp. I have to tell you I was a bit disappointed. I had a raspberry mojito and it was just ok. Tasted a little watered down, the glass was packed with ice and there was way too many mint leaves in it. Had the Ropa Vieja as an appetizer and I will say it was the BEST part of the meal. It really was delicious. My friend had the guacamole. I tasted it and it was very mediocre, like something from Pepes, nothing special about it, but the chips were good. I am always looking for guac better than what I had a Adobo Grill and have yet to find it! Adobo truly has the best guac I've ever had in my entire life! My entree at Carnivale was mediocre. I had the Churrasco. While the beef tenderloin was cooked perfectly, it had no flavor and I did not like the boniato puree. I guess it's an acquired taste but it tasted sweet and was too buttery, almost oily. The choclo corn had no flavor as well. The service was great and the decor is awesome, which is why I'm giving them at least 3 stars.
