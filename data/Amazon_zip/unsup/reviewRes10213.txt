Say what? I had thin crust in Chicago? Blasphemy!!!!!! I'm so excited to have finally had thin crust pizza in Chicago. I forgot how good thin crust was! Ordered a small white pizza with spinach, chicken and bacon to share between two. I had 2 slices and definitely could have ate the whole small pizza to myself. Come on, It is thin crust! I can eat a whole pizza if it is thin crust right?? le sigh. The last few slices were taunting me. The garlic wafting in my face was killing me. Thank god my friend packaged it and told me I couldn't eat anymore. I secretly wanted to knock him out and run with the pizza. Thankfully, I'm not that psychotic.....or am I................................. I also love that they are a microbrewery. Beers and pizza. What more could you ask for?
