Great customer service always wins my loyalty. I found my stay at the Ritz-Carlton (technically a Four Seasons hotel) consistent with other Four Seasons experiences. Mostly the Austin Four Seasons, since I haven't stayed at tons of these hotels. From now on, any time I can afford it, this hotel brand is my number one pick. We were traveling to Chicago with a little one in tow, so a child friendly hotel was our number one priority. We arrived a few hours before it was time us to check-in, so the staff checked our bags for us, and we were able to go out to lunch and explore the city. Upon check-in, the reception gave our little nugget a stuffed dog to play with. When we got into our room (the lake view is great!) our bags arrived minutes later, then they brought us a crib complete with a care package of diapers, wipes, baby wash, etc. The location was perfect, and when the downpour hit on our first morning, we were able to relax with an amazing breakfast at Deca and make our way to the stores attached to the lobby for some shopping until the sun broke through the clouds.
