Heres the deal...im from chicago..i know all the steak places we have in this city...but for some reason the ridiculous hot plate with my prime filet on it from Ruths Chris is the best. I rank this the best filet in the city....now best bone in goes to chop house..but we are speaking about ruths chris.. the scallops, whipped potatoes, baked, and filet are all very good...so good that i never change my order here...its decent atmosphere, not the best...but you are on hubbard so afterward you can shoot down the street for a good time
