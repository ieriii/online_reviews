Tru is a great Chicago restaurant! It is one of those places you go for the first time, and you do not feel out of place. It is pricey, but not over the top. Go in knowing that you will spend a cool $500 for 2 easy...but that is what you should expect from a restaurant with their caliber... I recommend you go with the Sommelier Collection...their wine pairings were fantastic!!! Overall, just save your pennies, and splurge, enjoy every moment! I highly recommend Tru!
