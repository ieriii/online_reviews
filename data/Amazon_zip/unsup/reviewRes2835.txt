I recently attended a company holiday party held in the private upstairs seating room at Tru. I had been so excited to try Tru because of all the wonderful reviews I had read here on Yelp plus, Tru recently received three Michelin stars. This place should be great right??? Well, from my experience it is not. We had a five course menu with wine pairing, started out with an amuse bouche which was fun and tasty. Overall the food was good however, nothing that I would write home about. What really put a bad taste in my mouth about this place was the service. On several occasions people in my party had to ask to have refills on their water and wine and the wait time between courses was ridiculously long (between the first and second course the wait time was 45 minutes). I'm assuming that this restaurant holds itself to a higher level of service if you are sitting in the traditional dining area however due to the service that I experienced in the private dining room, I wont be returning.
