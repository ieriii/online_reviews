What do you suggest an out of town guest from California who wants something healthy on the southside? I LOVE Nana's. It is always a wonderful experience. First of all, it is soooo cute. The food is great. So fresh and there is really something for everyone. From the coffee to everything on the menu, it is quality all the way.
