I wasn't impressed with this location at all. My friend had the bistec dinner and she barely ate any of it. I took a piece, didn't care for it so she ended up throwing it out.  The only empanada I thought tasted decent was the ropa vieja, but the sauce they give to accompany them was way too oily and therefore had no flavor. I brought a chorizo and goat cheese home for my mom and I don't care for goat cheese, so I didn't like that one but the chorizo was way too salty. I tried a beef at the restaurant and didn't care for it. I should have just ordered 3 ropa viejas and called it a day. The white rice was good. I normally don't eat white rice, but when it comes to latin food, it usually tastes different so I try it. The fried yuca had way too much garlic on it, and this is coming from someone who enjoys garlic.  I won't be coming back here unless someone makes me. I can get rice at many other places and there are many other places I get can empanadas. Maybe I should have tried a dinner different than my friend's, but nothing on the menu jumped out.
