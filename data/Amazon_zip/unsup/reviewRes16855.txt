Great food, great drinks, great atmosphere - need i say more?  Awesome place to go celebrate with a few friends, have some super delicious drinks and some great food. Granted, its overpriced, I definetly think it was worth it.  Atmosphere is trendy, cool, upbeat. Dress well and have a great evening here. FYI - It's a great place to host a party (company party, small party with friends etc). And they have valet parking for $6.
