My fiance and I took in Geja's for the first time with a Groupon on a Friday night.  Note 1 - location/atmosphere: We got a booth. I'm not sure if that makes or breaks an experience, but it definitely didn't hurt. It felt way more private, and much more romantic (I guess those two go hand in hand). The live acoustic guitar (flamenco-esque) was really...really nice. I wouldn't say we do romantic nights out often, but this place felt very romantic. It also felt almost pitch black - which can also be romantic?  Note 2 - service: Our waiters rocked. They were super informative, walked us through everything with their mini-flashlights, and always checked in (on a sidenote, my fiance thought the checking in was a bit excessive, but better than being forgotten about, right?).  Note 3 - food: The gruyere cheese fondue is tasty, and we got plenty to eat with the first course. The entree portion was good, and the beef was actually my favorite part. Lobster's great...but oil fried lobster isn't the best way to have lobster, so I'll leave it at that. My one complaint about the entree portion is: initially, the oil is clean and almost cooks up light. The veggies didn't taste oily at all, which rocked. However, as we worked our way through the platter, the oil began coating the food a bit more. It was less of a problem with the meat, but oil coated broccoli? Oil coated peppers? Not so hot. It started to feel VERY heavy when we were around 2/3 in. The chocolate course was tasty, but nothing special. I kept trying to place the flavor of the chocolate...and it was kinda like chocolate syrup. A little too sweet for my preference. Note 4 - overall experience: Positive. It's pricey, so be prepared. Overall, the food was good, the service was great, and the atmosphere was lovely. Maybe bring a flashlight so you can keep an eye on your food. Also...beware the slippery pepper. It fell off my skewer and getting that thing out of the oil pot was quite the to-do...
