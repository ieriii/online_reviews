Have gone for lunch and dinner -- the wait sucks for both since you can't make a reservation, but that's just part of the deal. So be prepared to sit at the bar drinking and laughing with friends.  The red salsa -- smokey, wonderful lil crack habit of mine. The Frontera red pepper & garlic salsa sold in stores is very close to it if not the same thing. So you can continue the party at home and be as naughty as you like.  Ceviche -- just pick one, it'll be delicious and refreshing. I enjoy jicama -- both the food and the word -- and the ceviche will gives me the excuse to enjoy both.  Gorditas de Carnitas - great lil appetizer. Totally dumbed down explanation - it's a kick ass sope. If you don't know what a sope is - I don't like you as much as I did when I met you. (But I'll wait for you...) Carne Asada a la Oaxaquena - marinated steak (yes, please), black beans (good God, yes please), and plaintains w/ sour cream (I would steal this from a baby) Champagne Margarita - wicked awesome* but really $$$ *I hate margaritas, so that's saying a lot. Pan de Muerto, Estilo Nuevo - didn't care for this. Was rather dry and sounded so much better on paper.  I have consistently been disappointed with the desserts in general here, and considering how good everything else is, that's why I would give this 4 stars. I want the last thing I have to send me off on a high note. If anyone can recommend a great one, I'm all ears.
