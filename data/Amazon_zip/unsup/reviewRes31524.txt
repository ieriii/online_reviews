Meh. I'm very meh about this place. I know it's "trendy," "cool," and "hip," but the whole thing is just meh. To be fair, I didn't eat dinner here. I met some friends for happy hour, had some cocktails and had the 1/2 priced bar menu. Honestly, I thought the food was OK, but I'm not really a fan of fusion.  It was all pretty good, and I guess I would meet friends here for drinks, but I don't think I would ever suggest this place as a meeting point.
