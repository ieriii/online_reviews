Nothing has changed here in years. This place is only good if you have to roll out of bed and go to McCormick Place.Its old and needs a total gut and remake.My room, Bathroom faucet handle broke, Leather lounge chair, has leather missing. Mirror in the room was tarnished all around, they gave me a room that had a shower n it. It had a floor that was 2 feet wide and then had a hill. So one foot was at one level then the other was on a stainless steel plate. VERY SLIPPERY WHEN WET. NO FREE INTERNET and $3.00 for a bottle of Aqua fina water..
