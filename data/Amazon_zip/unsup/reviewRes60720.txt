Here's why and why and why I might never go back...I went to Uncommon Ground for my B-day and was treated like crap. The hostesses made me and my family wait 40 minutes to sit down when there were more than enough tables open. Then to have both hostesses snicker about my family--YES I CAN HEAR YOU LOUD AND CLEAR... not cool. When we sat down we were eyed down by the one of the hostesses on and off for 30 minutes... A.) We're not here to steal your cups or spoons B.) We're not here to start problems C.) We're just here to enjoy a brunch with family. Then we were told by the hostess that we can't have my B-Day cake and when we asked wwHHyy ??? 0_o Because "it's unsanitary" and "a health code voilation from the city of chicago"... To make a note: the cake was from a licensed Bakery cleary Marked on the box... AND on tOp of it, we were told we could buy *their* birthday cake...are you joking?? My brother jumped on his phone to call his best friend who is a health code inspector and found that their hostess is full of @$%^ ... Don't lie to people and tell them outside cake is not allowed just to make a big scene... The only thing that made up for anything were the cooks who put magic on our plates: thank you and thank you... Just to let you know why I was extra let down: this was my first B-Day after 6 years of deployments that I was able to spend with my family, and you made it not so fun... Cheers
