It is hard to believe that I am even writing this. I still maintain that Lockdown is 1) The absolute cheesiest environment ever and 2)Should be a gay bar. It is right up there with "The Manhandler." Anyway, that said... A) Their back patio is awesome. B) Their drinks are not expensive C) They have great specials (1/2 price burgers on Mondays? Yes, please.) D) The burgers are better. Yes, better than KUMAS, by far. E) The servers there are friendly and down to earth & not like the faux metal girls that work at Kumas who need to realize they are not Gwen Stefani and they work at a freaking burger joint. So go. Put up with a cheesy atmosphere, but get a killer burger with friendly service. Oh, and if you are anything like me you will get to see some pretty brutal tribal tattoos. Fun to make fun of. Totally worth it.
