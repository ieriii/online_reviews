Ok, Ok, so I've worked at a pizzeria claiming to have really good Chicago Style Pizza and Gino's blows it right out of the water... The sauce is not too acidic and not too sweet resulting in the best combination of sauce ratio ever. Even if it takes 45 minutes for the pizza to get to the table, it's well worth it. Sip on one of their draft beers. They have a great list of em, and perfectly priced. I probably want to try their thin crust, as I love thin crust, but I dunno, I guess we will see. I havent read many reviews for it. The mozzarella sticks and marinara sauce is pretty awesome too. I mean, way better than most Italian/Pizza places. We had a great server, but the only thing I'll minus a star for, is because we weren't planning a trip to Gino's, we kinda just passed it and decided to dine in, we didn't have anything to mark the place up with our names. The server didn't have anything for us. Boo. But all in all, Great trip.
