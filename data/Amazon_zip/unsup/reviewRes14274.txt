This was our first time here, as all previous attempts had been met with a 2+ hour wait. Alas, we finally made it in for a late night meal. M got the brew flight, I got a Jim & coke - flight was around $17 and my drink was a very modest $5 - happy with that! Food: hard cider mussels, duck confit and cremini bruschetta w/ fontina cheese, Plum tomato bruschetta w/ red onion w/ basil w fresh mozzerella, arugula pizza, and the sausage and ham plate. Yes, for two people.... and nope, no shame ;) Mussels and pizza are BOSS. Cannot put into words how delicious the hard cider broth is... just amazing. Arugula pizza is of course covered in arugula, but also has mozzarella, shaved parm, tomato sauce and lemon infused olive oil. Really great flavors!! Do yourself a huge favor and order both of these. The bruschetta was good, but not the best I've had and the sausage/ham plate was decent too. Service was solid, not amazing, but very friendly. I guess expect to wait a bit for your server to return since it's a busy place - don't come at night if you're in a hurry. Like I said though, it's very friendly, which is most important to me! Can't wait to go back to try everything else!
