Sweet mother of all that is good, Noon O Kabab kicks serious booty! The kababs are all fantastic. I usually get a ground beef one and a chicken one as part of the combination. Trust me, it will be MORE than enough food! Along with Kababs they have great yogurt drinks, crispy rice (name??) and appetizers! Last time I went was before they renovated so I hear that there is more seating now!! Happy news! Go there with $20 and leave with a full, happy stomach and some jingling change.
