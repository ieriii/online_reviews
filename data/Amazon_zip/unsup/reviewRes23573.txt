Ooooooh, the crepe place.  I know that people usually go for sweet crepes, and don't get me wrong, they're really awesome here. Nutella? Chocolate? Fresh whipped cream? Yes, please  But the savory crepes are where it's at. My favorite has munster cheese, avocados, roasted peppers, sun-dried tomoatoes, spinach, cilantro, and greens. The flavors are just wonderful and really combine to give you something unique. The crepes are a deal at around $7 each including soup.  While crowded on weekend mornings, it's not bad the rest of the time. Definitely worth checking out for brunch or for a romantic dessert to share.
