I wish I had a car or did not have to take two buses to get here otherwise I would be there all the time. Maybe that is a good thing actually. Even though the double-meat in the Cubano scared me a little I went for it. It was truly delicious. I went with my part-Cuban friend who ordered a bunch of sides including the Yuca con mojo which was good, but not my favorite, but the Maduros, sweet plaintains were very good. My favorite were the empanadas particularly the goats cheese one and the sauce that came with it. I absolutely love empanadas and this one was delicious. The people who worked there were very friendly. a cool atmosphere and not expensive. I cannot wait to go back!
