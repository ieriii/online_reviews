We went here because we had the Groupon and I've always wanted to try it. Definitely a romantic atmosphere, and a fun dining experience. But it does take a long time, and you're working for your dinner. I was a little freaked out that they served the raw meats for my husband's dinner on the same platter as my veggies (not vegetarian, just pregnant and don't want to risk anything). But loved the whole experience with the cheese, then oil and sauces, and of course chocolate at the end. It's pricey, but certainly worth it to give it a try or celebrate a special occassion if you have a couple hours to spend at dinner.
