I HEART BRUNCH! The diverse menu is the biggest draw at Honey- you can get anything from pancakes, to beer to vegan black bean soup. The baked goods are great. Prices are very reasonable. This place can get very crowded during peak weekend brunch hours and since this is a small space it can be hard to get a table. Another added bonus is the drink menu Mimosas, blood Marys and other common afternoon cocktails are served along with wine and beer. Honey is a great addition to the Wicker Park neighborhood.
