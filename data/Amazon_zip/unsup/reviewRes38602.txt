"It was good, but it wasn't like omigawddd good". -TW Long wait yet efficient in that the restaurant allows you to pre-order you pizza while you wait. Downside: cold pizza :/ I ordered a pizza split into 2 choices: combination & Hawaiian. These pizzas are filled and gushing out CHEESE!!! But what about the marinara sauce? The sauce department was lacking big time. Service was weak sauce. Har har!
