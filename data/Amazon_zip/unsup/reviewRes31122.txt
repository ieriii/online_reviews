Wow, everything it was cracked up to be. Saw it on Check, Please and later found out it was also TripleD. The bloody Mary's were different, very interesting, with a great house-made pickle skewer and cheese. Very good. The burrito suizo and the nanadict were great, but those biscuits with the duck confit gravy... oh my goodness. Indulgent, but so worth it. We waited about a half hour for a table, not too bad for a Sunday at prime breakfast time. Like the bright interior and the staff was great. They had "pajama brunch" today which was cute -- staff and diners were in pj's and slippers. Wish I'd known that before I'd gone. I left so full that pj's would have been a major plus. Love the recognition of the local farms and the family environment... while still serving alcohol at breakfast. :)
