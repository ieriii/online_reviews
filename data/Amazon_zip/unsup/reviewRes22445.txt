If you live in the Chicago area and haven't been to Superdawg, you must go. There is a reason Super Dawg has been on the food network for the past ten years! This is not 5 Star Upscale Dining Experience so get that though out of your head before going; it is a DRIVE IN specializing in Chicago Style dawgs. The prices might be a little high, but you need to remember it is a drive up, so it is worth it. Whoever says there is a better hot dog out there doesn't know what they are talking about, because they have a unique makeup of the sausage, it is NOT a red hot, not what everyone else has. My only suggestion: DO NOT ask for ketchup! :)
