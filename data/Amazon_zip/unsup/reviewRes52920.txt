It's SO Cute! And the patio is really lovely. And the painting on the wall outside (which is inside the patio) is fucking hot. And And And...These guys are great. I'm a little sad to see the amazing bbq joint that used to live in this building is gone, but happy that it's been replaced by someone equally fabulous. My man and I were guests at a birthday party dinner of about 15 people. The staff at 90 Mile were very helpful and accommodating. They informed us of the best way to order for a large group and set us up with a nice table despite they're not taking reservations.  We ordered the red snapper and guava empanada. The snapper was fucking awesome. I don't even know how else to describe it, but I will of course try. It was crispy, meaty, flaky, savory, accompanied with great fried plantains and healthy doses of minced fresh garlic, onions and tomatoes. The meal is not for the faint of heart, as you receive the entire fish, eyeballs and all, cooked to crispy hot perfection, on your plate. The empanada was also really tasty, though I'm still not sure I know what guava tastes like since it tasted mostly like red pepper and goat cheese to me.  I was jealous of the Cuban sandwiches at the table though, not gonna lie. We also finished off with one of each of their offered desserts. The flan was out of this world. Like a love child between custard and jello. Love indeed. I wasn't mad about the bread pudding, but there was some amazing fruit filled pastry thing that was...amazing. Right then, that about does it.  (p.s. try the cafe cubano) (p.p.s. wasn't nuts about the mango shake I tasted)
