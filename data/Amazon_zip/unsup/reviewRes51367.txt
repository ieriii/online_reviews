Another gem I found through the boy I am dating. Their two dollar fish tacos are the bombs. So is their pineapple margarita. Queso Fundido really fills you up. I also love their spicy pork tacos and burritos. Service here can be painfully slow even when it's not crazy busy. It opens late and is cheap. It fulfills your hunger after too many weiss beers at Huttenbar late at night. So I am giving it four stars.
