First things first, I am NOT a vegetarian and I LOVE this place! Super friendly service in a great part of Boystown, my meat loving boyfriend and I love this place! Their Gyro is awesome! Never thought seitan could replace lamb but apparently it works, I did not miss the meat at all. Their Tzatziki is phenomenal. Their sweet potato fries are out of this world. At most places they are greasy, over fried, brown and sad. At Chicago Diner their sweet potato fries ACTUALLY TASTE LIKE SWEET POTATO! Imagine that!!! My boyfriend had their Dagwood Sandwich and loved it, also got the amazing sweet potato fries. Our second visit I ordered the Sweet Potato Quesadilla with gauc. It was very good but the sweet potato on it was a little too sweet, I could have used some onion on it for texture and to contrast the sweet. Still delicious though, their gauc is also great. Boyfriend ordered their Karma Burger, said it was great too. We both decided we liked our first meal better, Gyro and Dagwood Sandwich. First time going was for a birthday party and we sampled our friend's Vegan Cheesecake, it was somehow amazing. I do not know how you make cheesecake without diary taste good but Chicago Diner does it. I love this place, it is well priced, fresh, healthy and natural. It's a great alternative to a regular greased filled diner! They also have awesome variety and menu options from beers to desserts to entrees!
