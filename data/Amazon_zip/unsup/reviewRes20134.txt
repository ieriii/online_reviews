Yes, yes, the hype is all true. You MUST come here to try their churros with Mexican vanilla soft serve ice cream. IT IS SO DELICIOUS. And yes, the line is ridiculously long. We came here around 3pm in the afternoon and it was packed! We didn't want to wait 45 minutes to get seated, so we waited 10 minutes for a to-go order of the yummy churros and ice cream and ate the delicious goodness out on the streets. :) I wanted to try their other items on the menu because everything looked so good, but they're not open on Sundays or Mondays! So we didn't get a chance to come back here again.
