Here's the deal. If you like a good margarita- I suggest the agave one- then you'll like this place...and that's just if you sit at the bar. The main dishes are a little pricey but the appetizers are more resoanble. The guacamole was a refreshing change- it almost remeinded me of being back in my city of San Francisco. You gotta try this place at least once. Come on! It's Rick Bayless we are talking about here. You've just been yelped in.
