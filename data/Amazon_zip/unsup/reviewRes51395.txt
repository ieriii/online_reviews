Woo-wee, now this is a great burrito.  For just 5 bucks, I ate an amazing burrito that had tons of meat, not greasy, very lean cuts of steak, fresh avocado, and tons of fillings (without having any of the "filler rice" inside). The carne asada steak was prime. Like really, it was not greasy at all! And the meat was super lean and tasted great.  I'm impressed simply at the quality meat. The burrito itself was quite huge. A friend of mine says that Garcia's changes the burrito size to reflect the American economy. So when the recession kicked in, my friend noticed a smaller burrito. But now, it was huge ---- maybe that says the economy is about to get better! (crosses fingers). Anyways, you will NOT leave this place hungry and unsatisfied.
