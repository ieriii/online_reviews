I planned a trip to Chicago around a visit to Alinea. Extreme? No. Dining experiences are remarkably memorable, especially when the company and conversations are exceptional. Conversations spiced with delectable and creative flavour combinations are even more memorable. The Tour menu our party selected held 26 courses. We took the suggested wine pairing (and another bottle of Kosta Browne Pinot Noir 2005, despite a subtle disapproval from the sommelier) and set out to enjoy every tiny morsel. Except that 26 small portions turn out to a rather hefty meal. It takes discipline to taste every flavour in turn, especially while trying equally hard to savour the flavours of the paired wines and of course their interaction on the palate. It's hard to say whether I was successful, but it was a marvel of pairing creativity. It's intriguing to me how much asian cuisine is pulled into the repertoire of the Chef's imagination -- but clear Vietnamese, Japanese and Chinese influences are present along with more N. American culinary heritages from Italy, France, Britain and the like. (Earl Grey was used in the dessert, so... back off!) While I can't say that I was ecstatic during every course, I can say I was ecstatic for many of them. Not every combination worked perfectly to my tongue - but that doesn't detract from my sense of amazement at the detail and courage it takes to decide to create a tasting menu of such breadth and depth. Intimate seating, and elegant, visually soothing, non-distracting decor assures the patron that their attention will be focused on the food. Honestly, it's so very worth paying attention. 5 out of 5.
