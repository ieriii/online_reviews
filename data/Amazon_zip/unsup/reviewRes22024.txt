Don't spend your money here: mediocre food but *terrible* service. The free valet parking was the highlight of the meal.  The service is rude, unfriendly, and extremely rushed. Apparently, the most important thing at Greek Islands is to turn over the table as fast as humanly possible. The appetizers arrived about a minute after we ordered them, and the entrees came before we were done with the appetizers. The waiter kept trying to clear our plates while we were still eating, and two separate servers asked if we wanted dessert or coffee while we were barely halfway through the entrees. When we did order dessert, it arrived about a minute later. Had we been allowed to linger over our a food a little more, I'm sure we would have ordered a second bottle of wine for the table...but I guess that's an extra $40 I'm glad we didn't spend here... As for the food, it was nothing special, but admittedly not horrible. The saganaki was not even melted (presumably, leaving it over the heat for an extra minute would cut too much into their bottom line). The skordalia barely had any garlic and the texture was pasty, as if it had been overprocessed. The entrees were okay, and the grilled octopus was very tender. Their roast lamb is completely overcooked...we're talking gray/brown and dried out all the way through. Dessert was awful (galaktobouriko and rice pudding). With so many other options in Greektown, there's no excuse to spend your money here. Try Santorini right across the street, also with free valet parking.
