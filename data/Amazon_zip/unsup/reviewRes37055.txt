Met my brother in law here yesterday for an impromptu beer and to have some mussels and I loved it. I have driven by this place hundreds of times and never once thought to go in. I am sorry I didn't, but will make this a regular spot. I had a few different kinds of beers and my bro in law insisted we get the mussels, they were in a delicious broth and they served frites and some fabulos hot crusty bread to sop up the delicious broth. he bragged that they have the best mussels here and he was right. The bartender also ordered us the mini elotes and they were also fantastic! I will be back. The bartenders were great and the atmosphere was fun. Def a must go to place.
