I had a great time here! But I won't go back. Valentine's Day. Seated in a cramped spot approximately ten inches from the couple at table next to us. Very uncomfortable and awkward. My date asked to have us moved, but all available tables had the same problem. Not to worry, a couple of glasses of wine and we forgot all about it! Had GREAT FUN cooking and enjoying our three courses! Cheese, Surf and Turf, Chocolate and Fruit. Lots of variety. It was entertaining and very romantic. After dessert we were enjoying the glass of champagne that came with the package and gazing into each other's eyes, when we were asked to move to the bar to make room for the next seating. Not nice. I guess we lingered too long, but it takes a while to do all that cooking and seatings are scheduled only two hours apart. Because we both smelled like fried fish when we left, it wasn't really a problem. Although for this reason I wouldn't want to hook up with others after going to Gejas. We had our clothes cleaned the next week. No problem, the enjoyment still outweighed the drawbacks. I was VERY satisfied until I found out later, how much it had cost: Two people with the fixed Valentine's menu and a very modest bottle of wine: $290. Holy moly, we could have gone almost anywhere for that! It didn't seem to justify the Olive Garden caliber service (we had to pour our own wine), or the old pizza parlor atmosphere (cramped fuddy-duddy interior with greasy dust covered wine bottles), or the unspectacular dipping items and presentations. I think this is a good place to avoid on overpriced special occasions.
