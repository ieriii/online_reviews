This is place is one of my favorites in Chicago and I tell anyone who visits that they need to stop in for at least one drink...or three! Just going to this place is an adventure for anyone who likes cocktails (seriously, who doesn't like cocktails!?!?) and a big part of the adventure is picking out which one you want to order. It is like one of those "choose your own adventure" books I used to read as a kid (am I dating myself by saying that? do they still make those or do kids just play video games now?). The whole list is broken up into sections based on spirit. Brandy, rum, whiskey, tequila, bitters, and usually there are a couple vodka drinks for those who are scared. I always have a tough time choosing which one to order. I try to bring friends and then convince them to order something different, so we all can share! The cocktails are very creative and stay true to form by typically using only 3-4 ingredients. They use purified water for their ice and make cubes specifically for different glasses or drinks. My favorite is the highball ice cube which is a ling cube that stands straight up in the glass. This place even has rules of etiquette posted on the walls. I wish some of them were posted everywhere sometimes... If there is anything I don't like about the Violet Hour is that it can be very dark in there sometimes and at times service can take a while, but I just expect that. The drinks are handcrafted, pieces of creative art. You cannot rush them. Go check out the Violet Hour if you are just visiting or live in Chicago. The drink list changes seasonally, so you can always come back and try something new. What is your next adventure...
