I consider this by far, hands down, my favourite restaurant in Chicago!! You get the drift...:) Ambience I have been going to 'Las Tablas' for a little over 4 years now. It recently located across the street to a larger space with swanky interiors, and authentic Colombian artifacts all over. They even created this quaint sitting area downstairs outside the restrooms. On my last visit, on 03/05/08, they even had this guy singing Colombian music. The Food In 3 words...'to die for'!! Forget those pricy Brazilian steakhouses. If you want good Chicken/Steak/Shrimp dishes , Las Tablas is the place to go. For those of you who are familiar with Latin food and have been to and love Tango Sur, I still recommend Las Tablas. The menu is authentic and fairly elaborate and they offer combos...can't beat that! The Alcohol Till very recently, Las Tablas was BYOB!! Don't worry it still is to an extent. Although they have a full bar with ample beer & wine selection, you can bring your own wine but beware of the corkage fees. During the week, its an affordable and reasonalbe $4 but during the weekend its a whopping $8. Also if you love Mojitos, which I totally do, you have to have to get one here. The Price As I mentioned earlier, save your $$ from those Brazlian steakhouses. Las Tablas is NOT cheap but yet very affordable and a great place for friends/family to meet, eat awesome food and have a great time. The Service Has always been incredible. The waitstaff is knowledgeable, friendly and great with recommendations. OVERALL: Take my word and try this Chicago gem. You will not regret it!!!
