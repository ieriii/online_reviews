OK, I'm officially updating this place to a 5. I ordered takeout from there, and it was nicely packed with all the different little containers, and my meal was just as delicious as if I had eaten it in the restaurant. I'm about to lay down a rather serious statement since I have eaten a lot of food in this town, but the Tandoori chicken, saffron rice and naan may just be the most delicious meal I have laid teeth into in the city of Chicago. There, I said it. Lou Malnati's and Fleming's, please forgive me.
