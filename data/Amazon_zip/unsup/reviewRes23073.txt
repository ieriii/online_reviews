Amazing food! I've never had anything quite like this, but I can't believe I haven't been back since the time I went months ago after with with some friends. The oatmeal shake was so good. Even if it sounds strange to you, get it. You will love it. The rice, beans and plantains that come with multiple dishes were absolutely fantastic. The portions are huge, too, so four of us shared two entrees and an extra side. The seating area is tiny, so I can imagine it gets packed on the weekends during normal hours. We went during the week for an early dinner and had no problems at all though. I can't wait to bring my boyfriend here so we can order one shake, two straws and so much delicious Costa Rican food.
