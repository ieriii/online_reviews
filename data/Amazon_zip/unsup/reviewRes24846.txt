My boyfriend took me to Geja's last night for my bday. I'm a fondue addict and although I've been to the melting pot more times than I can count I had never been to Geja's. The atmosphere is adorable and absolutely perfect for a date...it's extremely romantic.  The cheese appetizer was by far our favorite part. For my entree I went with the seafood combination (delicious scallops, lobster tail, and shrimp). I had some difficulty in the cooking process at times (there is a reason I don't cook at home), but everything was delicious. The waiter brought me out a slice of bday cake before dessert, although I only had a few bites because I knew what was coming our way for dessert...chocolate fondue! I think I prefer the chocolate fondue at melting pot over geja's, but the entree and atmosphere was much better at Geja's. I was also very impressed with the service- the waiter was attentive throughout the meal. Overall, it was a great meal and a fabulous birthday celebration!
