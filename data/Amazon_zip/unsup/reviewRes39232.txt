4.5 stars. Pork belly confit over butternut risotto with roasted chestnuts and apples is one of the best dishes I've ever had in Chicago, and quite frankly, the entire country. Pork belly was crispy on the outside, tender on the inside, and just so flavorful (not much fat either). AMAZING. The risotto and apples helped to balance out the richness of the pork belly.  Seared scallops with braised oxtail and potato gnocchi - everything about this dish was great. Scallops were perfectly seared, and gnocchi is among the best I've had. Oxtail is always a win. Some of the other dishes were just mediocre -- the bone marrow and the burger. Service was great.
