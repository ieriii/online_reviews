After making a recipe in the Marshall Fields cookbook by then-unknown-to-us, Rick Bayless, and meeting him by chance in Macy's a few weeks later, my fiance and I were very excited to try out this restaurant. We were not disappointed. Reservations of 5 OR MORE persons are accepted, otherwise, expect to wait at least an hour. The wait goes fast as there are several great drinks to try (I recommend the Blood Orange margarita or the spicy chipotle ale) and you can get food such as the homemade corn tortilla chips with 2 varities of salsa. Our entrees were excellent as well, although take care in asking the waitstaff what is "spicy" as their definition may not match yours, particularly if you, like me, are a "spice wuss". My entree was a tad spicy for my tastes even after asking the waiter the spice factor, but the flavor was excellent.
