Chicago is known for it's great live music scene, and one of the greatest venues around is the Green Mill. On weekends it's open late....I mean waaaaay late, 5am on Saturdays. The prices are pretty average and the clientele is a mixed bag of young and old hipsters, hepcats, yuppies, geeks, freaks, punks, jocks, anybody who digs a laid back atmosphere and the best live music in the city really.What's super hip is the circular booths towards the entrance, and the table/dance area right in front of the stage. So whether you're looking to converse with some great background sound, or get right in the mix, there's accomidations for you.The only downside is that it fills up pretty quickly on weekends, so get there before midnight if you want to catch a table, or else you'll be forced to stand at the super long, super curvy, fully stocked bar with attentive bartenders and waitstaff....really that's not so bad.Overall,People who dig jazz, dig the Green Mill.
