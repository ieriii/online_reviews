Tru deserves every star that they get. This is a phenomenal culinary experience. If you are a foodie, Tru will not let you down. The wine parings were lovely, and the staff exceptionally friendly for an establishment that one might think of as uptight. If you have the honor of having the Chamomile cremeux, peaches, dried apricot vanilla desert paired with the Bonny Doon vineyard le vol des anges. Your palette will never me the same! Bravo!
