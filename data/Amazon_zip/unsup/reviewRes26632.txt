delicious paella, great short ribs, mushrooms, cheeses, and plenty more. good variety of tapas. pass on the patatas. good service and staff, great decor. unfortunately the portions are tiny and the food still takes as while to come out. went with a big group and the small plates were not good for sharing unless you order a plate of each dish for everyone. not that we didn't think the food was good but after spending $50 on dinner, we ate a second dinner elsewhere cuz no one was full.
