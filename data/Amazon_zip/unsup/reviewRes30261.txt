What? How is this so? No review from me yet?! Well, its taken this long cuz I thought I already had.  For quite some time, I wanted to go here. Always asking whoever I was dining with if we could go there for dinner. Turns out my friends are lazy and didn't want to travel quite so far so it took over a year for me to get anyone to agree. It has now again been many months since I was there but I will do my best to remember my experience accurately. What I definitely know is that I friggen loved the place! My decision to go vegetarian (well, pescetarian) was not made because I don't like the taste of meat. On the contrary, I loved it! So what a gold mine! So many fake meat options to give me back what I now miss. A reuben - god bless!! So yeah, that's what I had. Plus mac'n'chees (duh). AND a bloody mary! This little lady left as one fat 'n happy camper!  Man, I gotta go back...
