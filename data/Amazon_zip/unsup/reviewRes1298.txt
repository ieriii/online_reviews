Oh look. Yet another review for Hot Doug's. I usually make my annual pilgrimage here once a year (I live over an hour away, and it's really hard to rationalize traveling that far for a hot dog, so I wait til I find an excuse to be in the area), usually in Jan or Feb and at 2 or 3 in the afternoon. Still, despite my careful planning, there is ALWAYS a line. Which I don't actually mind. It gives me time to change my mind on what I had planned on getting, and then go back to my original idea. Several times. I always go for something that's on the specials list which are good, but this time I branched out and went for The Game of the Week, which was fantastic. Since they change all the time, it's not really worth mentioning in detail what it was, but if I'm ever faced with the opportunity to have an elk sausage again, I definitely will take advantage of that opportunity. I think the only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is that the buns are a little on the forgettable side. Don't get me wrong, the dogs themselves are great, the topping combos are interesting and delicious, but if you're going to put all sorts of great stuff on a great dog, shouldn't the bun be great as well?
