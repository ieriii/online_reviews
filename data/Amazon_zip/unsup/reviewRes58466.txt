After three attempts to dine at the Gage, I still don't understand the popularity. Tables are so crowded that on one visit my shoulders were crammed by the two individuals on either side...from seperate tables. Yet my dining partner was three feet away on the other side of the table. The place is not lively, it's NOISY. So loud that my dining partners and I can't hold a conversation and resulting in feeling deaf after leaving. Rude service...hauty. My second visit had the tables so close, that three other tables of diners had to scoot over for my partner to sit down, completely embarrasing us. The hostess was not helpful, just staring into space while we dealt with the situation. ( my partner is only 180 pounds and tall...so being a heavy person was not the issue). Similar issues with wait staff. Missing silverware, badly coursed food, and couldn't get fresh beverages.Extremely over-priced. I could forgive some of the noise and crampedness in a cheap restaurant, but paying $20 to $30 for the cheapest entrees or even more in this environment is ridiculous. Better to go a few blocks away to restaurants with plenty of space, plenty of delicious food, same prices maybe, but better service and I can hear our conversations.Three strikes...it's OUT!
