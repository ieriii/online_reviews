One of the best times I've head at a Loop restaurant (all things considered). The place was packed on a Friday night and we managed to get seated with only a 5 minute wait. The food was incredible and we completely trusted our expert server to bring us great meat/ cheese combos. Then we split the flank steak because everyone I knew who went to Carnivale said it was the best entree and it certainly was! In short, all things considered, Carnivale is one of the best dining experiences available in the Loop. Decor, service, and food were all first rate!
