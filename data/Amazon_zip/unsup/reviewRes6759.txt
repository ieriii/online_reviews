After one bite of the pickles, I knew I was in love - in love with a PICKLE. Seriously, I crave these pickles all the time, trying to get my friends to come to q with me so that I could just eat bowls and bowls full of pickles. By the time dinner or lunch or brunch has come out, I'm not even that hungry. Not to say that the pulled pork or chicken or whatever you choose isn't great, because it is - plus I love having so many options for sauces, but I really just want those pickles. This is convenient, because after I dragged yet another friend with me, he noticed that you can buy jars of their house-made pickles. Yes, please. I'll have another bowl of pickles. As long as the server doesn't whisk away that bowl before I'm ready, I really can never have a bad meal here. As much as I talk about pickles (I'm not kidding - I love them), I've had really great experiences with servers and all of the other actual menu items. Whenever you're around this area and looking for a well-priced meal and look at the slower life - come here!
