The 3rd Coast is... 1/3 coffee shop 1/3 family diner 1/3 creative escape It's also 100% old-school Chicago. And, there's not many of these great undercover spots left in the city. It's authentic, quiet and creative. My fondest memories at The 3rd Coast are catching up with old friends over Sunday brunch or sitting at a corner table all alone - trying to break my writers block and jot down something inspiring over a hot cup of coffee. Check it out. You won't be disappointed.
