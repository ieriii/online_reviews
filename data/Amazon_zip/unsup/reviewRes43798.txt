An unexpected delicious surprise. We were looking for a place for an early dinner since we had orchestra tickets. They were having there Spring fever menu, $20 for 3 courses off of a special menu. What a steal! Drinks: KinzieTini and Cucumber martini with splash of cranberry. The drinks were great. The cucumber one was perfect, refreshing, and only a tad sweet. Salads: Chophouse salad and Cesar salad. The chopped salad had a mix of fresh veggies. The salads were small but a nice start. Entrees: Mahi mahi was pan seared in a delicious cream based sauce. The sauteed veggies on the side were flavorful. The portion size was great. I couldn't finish my plate. The beef medallions with scallops were terrific. The meat was perfectly cooked and well seasoned. Dessert: We had the warm flourless chocolate cake. It was more like a molten chocolate cake and it was rich, deep, and delicious. This was a spectacular deal. Our waiter was very pleasant and prices on the regular menu seemed very reasonable. I'm glad we finally checked this place out.
