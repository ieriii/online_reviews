I'm a sucker for good curry and though we're not close to Devon Avenue, India House served up a pretty decent tilapia curry on a such a cold, bleak and rainy Chicago afternoon today. We've been to their $17 lunch buffet before but in recent years the food has definitely gotten much better. There is always a variety of vegetarian and meat entrees on the buffet, along with a few tasty appetizers like samosa.  Their desserts are a treat, with my favorite being the mango ice cream. It tastes like there are about 78 sticks of butter in it but it's so goooooood. :) India House is most comfortable to me when we arrive for lunch around 11:30 a.m. It gets very busy during the noon rush and can be an absolute madhouse on the weekends though. ----- UPDATE: As of Summer 2011, it seems that India House is firing on all cylinders as the food tastes much fresher and the spices are vivid. I'm upping my review from 3 to 4 starts, as they've truly earned it. It's great to have a nearby Indian buffet that features both curried Mahi and Tilapia as weekly specials during lunchtime. It's an outright steal, to be honest. If you can avoid sucking down all the beverages and pigging out on the samosas and dessert, you can seriously fill your belly on seafood that would be quite expensive during dinner or elsewhere.
