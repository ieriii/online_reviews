This place doesn't really need a lot of people online saying how great it is. It's incredibly popular and where else are you going to find sausages from rare animals. The more exotic sausages tend to be extremely flavorful and surprisingly filling. I can't say I like everything I've had there, but it's more about trying out something new and discovering what's good. Also the regular old hot dogs are not too bad and well priced. Just expect a long line.
