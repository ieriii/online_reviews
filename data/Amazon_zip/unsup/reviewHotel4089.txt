Please do something about the protesting! There have been many days that I've been awakened by the Hyatt Employee protests, and last night was an overnight protest - I don't appreciate being awakened in the middle of the night or early in the morning by whistles, drums, and people yelling, and I'm sure your guests don't appreciate this either! PLEASE NEGOTIATE WITH YOUR EMPLOYEES AND END THESE PROTESTS ALREADY!!!
