When I was a kid, my dad used to bring me down to the Royal Lake Gardens in Kuala Lumpur. We'd stroll along the banks of the lake and its surrounding canals. Often, we'd bring with us stale bread to feed the swarms of hungry carp that lived in the green waters. Well, I wouldn't feed pizza from The Art of Pizza to those poor bottom feeders. What am I missing? The pizza here is so awful I chucked it. TWICE. For some reason, I was dumb enough to give the place a second chance. I still flagellate myself periodically for being so stupid. On the bright side, I've really learnt to appreciate the phrase 'never believe the hype' on a near-biblical level. The deep dish is like eating a thick round loaf of week-old bread with salty ketchup on top. The thin crust is like eating a flat round loaf of week-old bread with salty ketchup on top. There were toppings? I didn't notice as I was heaving from the week-old bread and salty ketchup. On my second try with them? I actually had to snap off a piece of the crust, it was so hard. Yeah, snap. It made a sound that the Kellogg Company would love to patent. No. NO.
