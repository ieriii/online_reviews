Decent hotel, I stayed there for business and I am kind of a hotel snob so maybe this is why I only gave it 3 stars, but it was being renovated and everything smelled of wet paint.  Also not that I expect to be upgraded every time, but I do have Hilton status and usually am, and almost expected to be based on other yelper's experiences at this hotel - except this time, all I got was a free .5L bottle of water.  So I am fishing around for a .5L bottle of water in the mini fridge - didn't see one - there was a smaller Evian and a MOLD COVERED 12oz perrier can in the back. Gross. My room's fire alarm was so sensitive that me taking a shower with the door cracked set it off - at first I thought ok, it will stop in a second - WRONG - 4 full minutes later, I got out of the shower, waved a towel under the fire alarm for a bit, and it FINALLY went off. I was a little concerned that walking down 19 flights of stairs if it got evacuated would kill my night, so I am glad it finally stopped shrieking at me - but damn, if I wasn't worried for a few minutes.  So yeah. Cool looking historic building, pretty good location (except not really near any EL stops) - but I won't stay there again unless desperate.
