I took my wife to Tru for our wedding anniversary, although we had a great evening base on our opinion and in comparison to several other high end restaurants in US, Tru is over rated and expensive! Decoration and the ambiance o f this restaurant was wonderful however I was disappointed for the chef serve a piece of chicken as one of the course!! I would recommend Tru for Caviar and cheese but for the price you can have a much better dining experience at L2O or Next!
