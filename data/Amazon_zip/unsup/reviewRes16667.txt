After months of build-up I finally ventured to Violet Hour to experience the hype. I can't imagine finding a better bar in Chicago. The drinks were top notch, the environment was top notch and the servers were top notch.  Violet Hour is a pretty out there experience from the start. I had heard that the door was unmarked besides the address, but I didn't realize the outside of the place looks like a dump. The address is stick on numbers. The entrance is unfinished and strangely cold. Once you get inside, the magic begins, and does not stop until you leave. The drinks are delicious and total works of art. Be ready for your palette to experience some good times. i actually found the price pretty reasonable. I have no problem paying $12 for masterfully crafted drinks made of top shelf ingredients.
