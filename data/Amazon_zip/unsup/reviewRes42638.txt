I saw this restaurant on Chicago's Best and was instantly in love. I ordered the Brick Over Chicken dinner, which came with 2 sides for only $8! The meal came promptly and still steamy and was AWESSSOOMMMMEEEE!!! I'm telling you the chicken was moist and flavorful, and the marinade was unbelievable!! I don't know what's in the marinade, and I don't want to know - the mystery is so very tasty! I am looking forward to more meals from Fogo 2 Go! I HIGHLY recommend it!
