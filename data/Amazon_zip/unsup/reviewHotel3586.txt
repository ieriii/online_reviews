I don't get it. I just don't get it. I'm a big gross sweaty mess, even though IT'S TWO DEGREES OUTSIDE. Why why why why why why?!?!?!?!? (Shut up, it ain't menopause, bitches) So who knows what's going on, but I'm sweating up a freaking storm as I'm waiting in line to check in. I'm surrounded by a Christmas tree, train tracks, fake presents, and lifesize wooden toy soldiers. Gag. The line is moving really slow - there are only two people at the check-in counter, and we're about 6 people deep. I can't help it, I notice a small pool of sweat dripping onto the old carpet. Seriously, what's wrong with me?!!? I finally get to the front, check in, get my keys, and turn around to go to the elevator. Except for I trip. And I fall. Like HARDCORE fall. I throw my luggage up in the air, it knocks over a toy soldier. One of my shoes comes flying off and hits a guest. I land face first into the 90 year old carpet. OH GOD I FELL INTO MY OWN SWEAT PUDDLE. As I stand up, totally embarassed, I notice MY NOSE IS BLEEDING. I'm leaving a blood trail on their 90 year old carpet. I'm a TRAIN WRECK. The Drake Hotel staff runs to my side, asks me if I'm ok, has a towel on my nose, has already adjusted the fallen over human-sized toy soldier, has my luggage on a cart already, and is putting my shoe on already. Someone hands me a glass of water. DAMN. That is SOME SERVICE! Minus two stars because the Drake gave me the wrong key to my room FOUR times. Which means I had to go back to the scene of the accident FOUR TIMES. And be stared at by the staff who so thoughtfully helped me FOUR TIMES. And had to relive my epic fall FOUR TIMES. How would you feel having to pass by the same person who just saw you flowing BLOOD THROUGH YOUR NOSE again not just 2 minutes earlier? Might I remind you I hadn't yet gotten a chance to get to my room yet... so I still had BLOOD STAINS on my clothing. Oh, I don't know if I mentioned - FOUR TIMES.
