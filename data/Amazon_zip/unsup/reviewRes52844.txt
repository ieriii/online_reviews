I consider this place one of the gems in Chicago. I absolutely love their food. The ropa vieja dinner is my favorite and I love the bistek sandwich. Its very tasty and I just wish this place was closer to me. Anytime I'm in the area though I will eat here. So, I'm usually in the area a lot ...hahahhah. Great atmosphere, great food, great service, but get there early because sometimes it gets crowded and full.
