Fun atmosphere....great variety of dinner options....amazing mojito's ....attentive service and beautiful decor. We came with friends who were visiting other friends who live in town and recommended the restaurant. Everyone had a lovely meal and enjoyed the whole experience. I had the beet salad and fish taco's....we all shared the guacamole to start with the home made chips. We will def go back.
