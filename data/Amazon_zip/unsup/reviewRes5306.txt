This was a great place to try something different.  We ordered several dishes and our favorites were roasted bone marrow smear and foie gras smear. Mussels were good but not great.  Octopus with green beans and potatoes were delicious.  It was rather pricey for what you get but it was very fresh and tasty. The only dish we did not care for was broccoli with roasted garlic and anchovy vinaigrette.  It was too salty. The service was great and we will definitely be back to try different dishes.
