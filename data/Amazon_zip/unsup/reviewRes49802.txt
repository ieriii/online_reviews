The food here was awesome that is true...The meat was flavorful without being overly salty or otherwise extreme and they had the tropical drinks (made well) that Colombians (and others) know and love... What they do NOT have is service. Sure, the waiters were ok, pretty nice and attentive and everything but what absolutely KILLED it for me and a few others of our group was the absolutely un-helpful lead hostess behind the podium. I asked her (before we had been served any food) if she could move us to another table (most of the restaurant was completely empty) and she gave me some mealy mouthed denial saying something like "Well if only you had asked me Before you had ordered then I could have done it." WTF??!! I have asked this before and never had any problem. We were seated in one of the worst possible tables right in front of the entrance where my entire family was in a freezing draft and everyone of the servers and other patrons had to go around us to get to the restroom, the bar, or just to go in or out of the tables area. The LEAST that she could have done is move us to another table but barring that if she had some kind of sincere and good excuse my concerns might have been allayed but she did not even try...Even worse, she was obviously more interested in talking with the other servers and staff than she was in devoting the least bit of attention to her CUSTOMERS...And no you cannot excuse this by saying something like "Well that is Colombians for ya great food but horrible service" I have heard this about other nationalities and it is never any more true...The service industry especially lives or dies by their customer service and with this lack of the most banal and trivial service Las Tablas has guaranteed I will no longer patronize them and highly recommend others do not as well...
