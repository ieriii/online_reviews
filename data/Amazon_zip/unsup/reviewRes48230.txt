On a normal night, two Alpha King Pale Ales, a tube of pork rinds, a plate of pickles, and a GIANT plate piled with ham (three types) would be more then enough food. I'd probably get the meat sweats and fall asleep on the cab ride home.  This night, it was just the appetizer because I followed it up with an ENTIRE CHICKEN. And two more Alpha Kings.  I'm not sure why my wife and I ordered so much on our first trip to the Publican, but I ended up gaining seven pounds from this meal alone. The food is good - nothing amazing but delicious, fresh, and carefully prepared. Service was pretty solid and the atmosphere was unique and fun (think modern German farm/bar). The beer list is great but I was expecting a little more variety on the draft list. Overall, it's a great experience for a pretty decent price.  But be careful with how much you order because you WILL eat everything that ends up on your table.
