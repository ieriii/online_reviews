First off I have to say that my standards for mexican food are Extremely high, particularly when it comes to the margaritas, and that Mayan is far and above my favorite restaurant in the whole city! I've been coming to Mayan for years, and though its popularity has boomed in recent years it still has the best service and feeling of family warmth. I love this place so much, that I have taken it upon myself to convert all my friends into believers too. not a complaint yet! And if that wasn't enough ... half price margaritas Tues/Thurs?? 'nough said
