i went to chicago in october and this was my favorite place of all! the food was awesome, i was there with 2 other people we had 2 apps. and split all of our plates! it was really nice out during the day so we sat outside in the back patio which had a great atmosphere. the staff was really friendly too! next time i'm in the area, i'll definitely be back!
