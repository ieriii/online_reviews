Okay, so I guess the proximity still draws me in. I think their manhattan is amazing, and now that I have eaten there enough times, I think I have ordering down. I don't eat the crisps that come with anything (too salty still) and stick to what I know). I really appreciate the vegetarian friendly version of their menu. I'm not a veg, but think it's cool they do that.
