The Green Mill is place where people can come and social dance. Granted, the floor is a little small but it takes place, which is refreshing. The bands are great and don't disappoint. There are a few too many tourist but it's manageable. The bartenders are matter-of-fact, no nonsense types but they get the job done and I've not met an unfriendly one yet. The patrons could work on their courtesy skills but that's a rant for another day. The club can get shoulder to shoulder but that adds to the vibe. This is a place where young and old are welcome and seen cutting a rug or two. Seating can be sparse but I feel that invites the stander to dance; so go ask someone to dance.  The interior is a gem. Not updated since an era far gone by but it's still beautiful and I'm glad the smoke isn't touching it anymore. This isn't a place to impress but if you want to see some great bands and get a little dancing in, by all means stop by the Green Mill. Leave your attitude at the door and have a grand time!
