I went last Friday night with a group of 7 friends. We had to wait about an hour and a half in a crowded waiting area, but hey it was Friday night what do you expect? It is BYOB so we all sat and drank while we waited for our table. The service was quick and friendly. The sushi was good but a little pricey. It was a good time though!
