I don't usually give out fives, but I think this place deserves one. First off, it's BYOB which always helps cut costs while dining out. Also, I'm a big fan of having bread with cheese and oil while I wait so I greatly appreciated the bread to munch on (however, it could have been a little tastier.) When I ordered, the waiter was very helpful and he seemed to enjoy his job and the food at Caro Mio. The portions were big allowing me to to have it again for lunch and dinner the next day! Lastly and most importantly, the meal was very good. All in all, I had a good time there, enjoyed the food, and didn't spend an arm and a leg!
