This review is really a 3.5. I went here on a weeknight because it's BYOB Monday to Thursday. We had the empanadas sampler, I thought they were a little over-fried and hard to cut into. We also had the grilled marisco salad. I thought it was nicely seasoned, and I loved the lime vinaigrette dressing on the house salad. We ordered the entraa steak that came with a sweet plantain, yucca, and baked potato. The plantain was tasty, and the steak was amazing! Like the empanadas, the other sides seemed really dry or over-cooked. For dessert we had the flan de coco, which was nice and creamy and very yummy. Obviously this place is known for steak, and that part was great. Some of the other parts of the meal didn't come together like I would have wanted, but I would go back and try some other things! Lastly I was a little disappointed with the service. It was the kind where they took a while to come open the wine and refill water, but they were hovering as you finished your last bites to take away plates. The server was friendly, but could have been more attentive when it counted.
