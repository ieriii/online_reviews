Hopleaf and I have spent many nights together. I'd like to think that we have something truly special. Five star tribute to this joint indefinitely. The choice of micro brews and beers would make one's head explode, not by quantity but by quality. The bartenders will let you sample a taste of brews so that you don't make the mistake of ordering something your taste buds won't enjoy. Find the right craft brew and accompany it with something savory from their menu. If you're a sandwich buff, I would highly recommend the Duck Reuben. Absolutely rich in flavor and it balances well with the frites and garlic aioli sauce. I usually wash it down with a sniffer of Tripel Karmaleit. If you decide to check this joint out, make sure you hit me up. I'll join you in a heart beat.
