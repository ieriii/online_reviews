With over 150 reviews for this place and most either four or five stars I don't think I need to add any more fuel to this fire. It's excellent small plate food that's meat, egg, and cheese heavy. There is absolutely no waiting space so be prepared to wait outside or put your name in and stroll Michigan Ave for some time. The beer list is a little small, but for what they carry it's some good stuff. I look forward to coming back here more often.
