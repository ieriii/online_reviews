After handling an important business around this neighborhood, this place caught my attention. Well luckily my sister and I got seated right away but, this place gets really packed however it's evidently worth the wait. When it comes to breakfast I usually know what to order but, the options on the menu are endless. A couple of awesome facts are that at the beginning there is free coffee (unfortunately I don't drink coffee) there's tons of daily and other especial to choose from and don't get me started on smoothies, is just something to experience. Service was great yet lacking well do to the fact that they are extremely busy. This place takes you away from your ordinary breakfast restaurant.
