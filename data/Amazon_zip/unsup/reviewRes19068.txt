In the land of sub sandwiches and greasy fast food, Xoco stands alone. And if you time it right (I'm talking a super early/late lunch or a bad weather day), you can enjoy Xoco without the typical long wait. After a few visits, I have realized that I am disappointed with ordering anything other than the Ahogada. That's not to say that the other tortas aren't spectacular, it's just in my mind- the Ahogada reigns supreme. The spicy tomato broth is amazing and the picked onions add a zesty touch. It's awesome in every way. My husband's favorite is the Pepito, also a flavorful masterpiece. Don't even hesitate when they ask you about a dessert. The churros are a must-get. So, if for some reason you haven't tried Xoco yet, wait for the next blizzard or tornado warning, tell your boss you are taking an earlier lunch - and go enjoy Rick Bayless's culinary genius.
