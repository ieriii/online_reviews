A solid establishment and overall groovy place, 5 stars in my book! Shortly after moving to chi, I was in wicker park at a very overpriced shoe store with my boyfriend. As he stood deciding if what he wanted was worth it, I struck up a conversation with one of the sales associates about places to try being a newcomer to the area. She recommended Violet Hour and said it was very easy to get to. I knew it was close by and just assumed she suggested it for that reason, so I took her advice with a grain of salt and headed home for dinner. It was then that my boyfriend suggested we look it up and POOF back to wicker park we went. The place is mind blowing. The door and door handle are hidden by graffiti but once you find it and go inside everything is gorgeous, dimly lit, and with a ballroom-esque 1920's pre prohibition era feel. Comfy high backed chairs and flowing curtains make for private little nooks in an otherwise airy room. Cocktails are not cheap- $12 each, but worth every penny! The bartenders there are more of mixologists, they make every ingredient on premise so freshness (and did I mention strongness) is never a question. I'm not even a gin person but the waitress suggested the Juliet and Romeo for me which was AMAZING- gin, mint, rosewater, I think that was it, and I was d-runk without so much as a single gag. I take everyone here and they all love it They also have some small plates, paninis, and desserts Do try!
