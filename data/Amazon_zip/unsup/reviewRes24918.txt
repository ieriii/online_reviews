Oh sweet flatbreads, I would marry you and have your babies if I could. Between the two flatbreads I got my greedy little hands on - the margherita one and the shortrib one - my ass was in heaven. To me they tasted fresh, different, and damn good. The rest of the menu - I've gotta admit, I was a little wtf. A lot of cool tasty looking variety, but def not cheap. Since I'm a total pussy and the last person to try something new I stuck with the flatbreads, which of course didn't stop my fat ass from sampling everything else that came to the table. It was all tasty as hell, I've gotta admit.  On the stupid fruity drink front I rocked their mojito, which was tasty tasty - but totally fucking weak. Seriously, I downed two in minutes and I didn't even feel a buzz or remotely slutty - which equals fail on the drink front. Especially when I blew $24 on the two of them. And the entire time we kept having to turn away other people's food which was mistakenly brought to our table. At first I thought damn, am I really ordering all this shit and can't remember anything - maybe those drinks were stronger than I thought. But no, and of course they mistakenly brought some flatbreads - way to screw with my mind Mercat! Anyways, totally dug our server, who was super knowledgable about the menu and was free with the good suggestions. Next time I'm in the mood to satisfy my flatbread whore tendencies - this is where I'll be.
