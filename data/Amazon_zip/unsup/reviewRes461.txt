Dinner at Alinea was delicious. I can't even describe how good the food and wines were. I can't say that I loved every course, but I sure walked away from dinner thinking about how to work some of those Alinea flavors into my dishes at home. One thing I'll say- I'm not sure that kind of food is really for me; the "gastro-pub" type food. I try to go out of my way to eat whole foods, and all that manipulation didn't really go over very well with my body. The food at Alinea was amazing, the flavors were stunning, and every bite surprised. But for me- well, to put it delicately, my body couldn't really process the food. It actually made me pretty sick. Which, was kind of a buzz kill. That said, I'm so glad we went. It's something I've always daydreamed about, and the experience met all of my (very high) expectations.
