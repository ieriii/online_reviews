This is a place for foodies, adventurous foodies. Reminds me a little of Bristol in Wicker Park, although it is more casual. The prices were surprising for the casual bar-theme of this restaurant, expect $20-27 for an entree, with small portions. I recommend doing the appetizers, sandwiches, salads and plates section of the menu. We tried the lambs heart, at the persuasion of our server, and I suppose I'm glad I tried it for the sake of trying it, but it was very bland and boring in proportion to the concept of "hey i'm eating a heart right now". I found everything was either bland or overpowering in terms of flavor. The beet salad was good, but I felt was totally overpowered by a Bacon-Grease infused dressing. My tuna entree also had only the fatty bits of bacon on the plate, not even the crispy delicious part of bacon that I love. There was even a bacon ice cream, but I decided I'd had enough by that point. I'd say that this place is a fun place to experiment with new flavors, but I'm not sure they have those flavors figured out yet. Everything tastes "interesting" but not sure it tasted Good or Great.  Highlights: Meatball appetizer (3 teenie tiny meatballs, but tasted good), creme brulee, friendly and informative server Lowlights: overpriced, sometimes bland, sometimes over-powering flavors
