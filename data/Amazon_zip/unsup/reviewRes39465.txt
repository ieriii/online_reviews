If you've been around the Korean culinary block a few times you know not to expect any kind of high-end service while dining. This restaurant is no exception, however the food more than makes up for it. The Kal Bi and Bulgogi are seasoned to perfection and once grilled over charcoal, cancel Christmas. Amazing taste!! The best chop chae any where around and tons and tons of bahn chan make this a well-rounded winner every time. Word of caution: you will get very, very smokey, so wear jeans and casual clothes.
