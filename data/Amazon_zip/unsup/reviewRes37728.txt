Gotta love places that serve a large amount of high ABV beers. During winter I had a beer that was 14-15%, and it was really a beautiful thing. I'd like to come back here with some money and actually be able to afford to get more than one, but you really don't need too many more than that anyways. Other than the beer, seems like a cool spot. It was a bit crowded when I went, but it was Saturday, so that's to be expected. In a really cool neighborhood too- I look forward to checking this place out more.
