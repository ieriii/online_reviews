All I have to say is thank god I was on an expense account for this one. Service SUCKED. Bus boys were okay but our actual server was worthless and acted like he was doing us a favor by serving us. Nice ambience except for the horribly FILTHY windows. I mean the place is basically all windows and you feel like you're sitting in your car looking out the window your dog just got done licking. Really tacky. The food- I had mussels and they were inedibly salty. Date had halibut, it looked okay but I don' t think he felt it was worth it. I think their menu really needs some help. 3 fish entree choices, 1 vegetarian, a duck, a chicken, pork but no beef. It just did not inspire.  The wine was good and I thought the prices were fair. In September they have 4 different wines offered at $4/glass which is a great deal. The wine & cheese lists look interesting but not interesting enough to make up for the other shortcomings. I wish I could re-do this menu. Hell I wish I could re-do this restaurant. It really wouldn't be too difficult to make it noteworthy. Oh and it is terribly LOUD in there. Either the acoustics are horrible or people (tourists?) really do not notice that they are screaming at each other over the din of the booze. Two huge tables full of screetching women. Awful.
