I must confess that this was my first time dining at an Ethiopian restaurant and I was defiantly pleasantly surprised. You don't go here for great service or a killer wine list...no, you go here to fill your belly with lots and lots of food!! What we had: Vegetarian sambussa: spicy and delicious! Would order again. Ambassa (bread with homemade cottage cheese): FANTASTIC. Demera Messab for two: This platter comes with 6 mix and match dishes...I chose 3 vegetarian ones: ye misir wat (spicy red lentils)= not as spicy as desired, which I found strange because I kinda envisioned myself sweating through the whole meal. Ye shimbra assa( chickpea dough thingie) was absolutely delicious, please try! And tickle goman which was a delicious stewed cabbage and carrots...this dish was a must try because, well, it was not only delicious but added some much needed vege's in a sea of carby meal! Why the 3 stars? The service was terrible! We were there for over 2 hours and NOT by choice. Also, I have nothing to compare Demera to and while it certainly was yummy, I think A-OK is pretty positive, don't you?
