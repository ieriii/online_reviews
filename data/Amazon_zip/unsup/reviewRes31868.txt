scene and be seen! I have been to Sunda a few times now and have enjoyed each time I've been there. Yes, it's trendy, yes, it's hip, yes it's the scene and yes the food is very good. Rockit Ranch Productions does know how to incorporate all of that making your experience a heck of a lot of fun. Each time I have been there we load up on the apps and don't really focus much on the main courses. The devil's basket is a very cool concept of a caldron filled with dried hot chilis and delicious fried soft shell crab. The toast and jam is another cool concept and also very good. For entrees the miso bronzed black cod and shaking beef are great choices. The mix of asian flavors and dishes make for a unique dining experience that I know will keep me coming back to try other dishes as well.
