I ordered the beef stew on a cold and windy night. What I received was the most amazing beef stew I've eaten. Sorry mom! It's basically a huge meal in a bowl. I've tried most of the onsite brewed beer and have never been disappointed. The staff here is top-notch. Stop in for dinner or lunch or just get your butt there for a few Chicago beers!
