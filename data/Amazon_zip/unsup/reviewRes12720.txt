yum yum yum! went there to celebrate my sister's birthday, this was the restaurant of her choice. Cute decor, low lighting, nice place to meet friends or dinner for two. Started out with ceviche and empanadas, ceviche was very fresh, it is made in a sweet tomato base which was a nice change from the lime and jalepeno mix, the empanada filling had a nice seasoning and not greasy at all. We split the steak (med rare, juciy and tender ) served with rice, beans, and plantains, special of the day Halibut which had a nice crust on the outside and flaky, tender and moist on the inside served ontop a bed of greens, and the honey pork chop-wowza! 2 inch thick chops with a nice strip of fat on the edge that caramalized and added flavor to the chop. Service is very attentive and paced well, didn't try the dessert as we were so full, but we will be back!
