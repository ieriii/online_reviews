I have a love-hate relationship with Alliance. I used to spend hours and hours using their free wireless and basically mainlining their house coffee. But I walk by Alliance everyday and feel a little resentful towards the place. I'm not one to support Starbucks (one and a half blocks east on Division) but frankly, if I'm stopping for coffee on my way to the Blue Line, I'm stopping at Starbucks. And to tell you the truth, I despise Starbucks' black coffee, but I can't take the risk with Alliance. 9 times out of 10 in the morning, it's going to take upwards of 6 minutes to get my coffee at Alliance, but I've waited more than 15 minutes for the baristas to get their acts together. While the cakes in the window and the pastries in the display cases are mouthwatering, they look better than they taste. And I'm the type of person that will take all manner of abuse from baristas, servers, or hostesses if the product is good. But their cupcakes are dry and crumbly, the croissants look delicious but are always half-burnt, and a medium coffee will run you $2.25, AND they make you wait for it. In addition, the tables in the "study" area are creaky and off-balance. When you're trying to type and every depression of the keys makes your table rock and the tattoo-ed philosophy student next to you glare menacingly, it kinda makes you resent Alliance and the world at large.  But I still go there. Love-hate relationship, I told you.
