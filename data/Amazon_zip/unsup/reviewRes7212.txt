First visit to Chicago Q and for the most part, very impressed. 10 of us gathered on a Friday night for a friend's b-day celebration. We were seated in the round room right by the entrance. It was nice, good space, but did feel sorry for the party of 2 that was sharing the space with us as we were a bit loud. Of course, the noise level in the space is way above conversation level. To start with we had the bason chedder hush puppies. Can I say gone to heaven! YUMMO! The house made pickles and chips were a nice addition, something to munch on between servings. I had the St Louis Ribs and they were good. Not outstanding, but good. I have them again. All other plates looked fantastic. On of our party wanted to mix up a little with the combinations and they were very accomodating. Desserts were good, the carrot cake especially. One thing to note, it was a very busy friday night. After we had ordered the desserts, the waiter and bus boy began to hover near the table, removing items the second they appeared to be finished with. In addition. the check was brought to the table prior to the desserts being served. MESSAGE loud and clear, we need your table.  As we were leaving to get our coats, there was a significant crowd waiting for tables. Several comments being made about the large party "finally" leaving. That was from the hostess to a party waiting. So, overall, the food was very good, I'll go back for sure. Overall dinner service was fantastic. Wrapping up the meal, not so much. Just felt rushed.  Definitely will go again, probably with a smaller party and not on a Friday night.
