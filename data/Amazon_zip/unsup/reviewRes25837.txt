I was not impressed by this place. With all the hype I had been hearing about how it was supposed to be so romantic it was a huge let down. First off, I had read that you have to wait for one of the booths to get the most out of your experience. My bf and I had reservations, but waited at the bar for about an hour on a Sunday night for a booth. Ok, fine, I can deal with that as long as the food is good. However, I was hugely disappointed by the food. The Melting Pot is seriously 100 times better than this place. First off, I was not impressed by the taste of the cheese fondue, it was just, meh. On to the meat course, I was told that we could only cook in oil, which I really did not want, but went with it anyway. Right after the oil was put down on the table some of it shot up and hit me in the face. The waitress was still standing there when this happened. I said to her, "um, ouch, this oil just hit me in the face". She is like "Oh yeah, it happens". Okay, wtf. I have been to the Melting Pot a handful of times and have had fondue at other places, I have never had this problem before. The oil continued to shoot out and burn us at random points during the meal. Also, your meat does not stay on the forks they provide, it falls off into the pot quite often. To top it off, your couldn't tell if your meat was cooked or not because it was so dark. The whole experience was very frustrating. For the end, the chocolate fondue was nothing to write home about. Not worth it. Skip it.
