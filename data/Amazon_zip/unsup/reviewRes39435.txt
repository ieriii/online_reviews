I have wanted to eat here forever. FOREVER. So finally I had brunch and it completely lived up to my expectations. I got there Saturday around 12:30 and even though there was a line, things moved pretty quickly and we were seated within 45 minutes. While waiting, I tried a Logan Palmer which was awesome and made me feel slightly drunk considering I hadn't eaten yet. For brunch/lunch I had the tete de cochon egg sandwich... which is basically an open faced sandwich with a fried egg on top. Pretty much everything about it was perfect -- but I have to admit, seeing everyone with the fried chicken & waffles made me which I had gotten that instead. For three people, brunch ended up being just short of 60 dollars (including drinks both of the alcoholic and caffeinated variety), which I would say is extremely reasonable.
