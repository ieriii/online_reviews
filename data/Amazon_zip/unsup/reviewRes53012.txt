My first impression was of the mural of two skinny street dogs on the corner of the building. A little edgy, a little sense of humor, a pretty good way to start the experience. The menu is full of fairly basic Cuban staples. We had a Cubano and a Ropa Vieja. After we ordered, I noticed a lot of side dishes using guava, including empanadas. I'd like to come back and try some of those. THe interior was quite a bit nicer than I'd expected. The walls are covered in Cuban themed articles and a few family-friendly pinups. There's a good deal of counter seating inside, and a basic patio outside. The bread for both sandwiches was spot on what you'd expect, crunchy and chewy at once. The Ropa Vieja had a great flavor, but the Cubano was fairly bland. We dumped some deli mustard on it at home and brought it back to life. In the end, I liked everything about the place, but our sampling of sandwiches weren't good enough to push it into 4-star territory.
