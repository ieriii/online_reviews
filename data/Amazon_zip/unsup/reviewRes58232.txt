Um, YUM! Since I'm Korean people always ask me where to go for really good Korean food and I never really have an answer for them since I make Korean food at home and my mom's food is excellent! But now I can recommend Crisp if you want a fast food Korean place. I had the Crisp BBQ wings and the bi-bim-bop with the bulgolgi. The sauce was good and I did not know that they give you the whole wing when you order chicken wings! The bi-bim-bop was good and actually a lot better than some of the other Korean restaurants that I've been to. I really can't do the Americanized Korean food so I probably won't try anything else but if I need a bi-bim-bop fix or Korean style wings, Crisp is where I will be. Oh just so you know, the serving sizes are huge!
