This review is for Brunch only (I've never had dinner here). $24 for an all-you-can-eat fest of more food than you can shake your stomach at. I'm a vegetarian (no fish, but I do eat eggs/milk), and there was a TON here. Too much in fact. I'm not sure I need to eat for the next 2 days. The food was delicious! There were 5 different "stations" at the buffet area: fruit, salady selections (such as a chickpea/carrot salad), bread/cheese/olive area (complete with truffle butter and sherry butter), an oatmeal/french toast station (apparently these items need their own area), a dessert table (they were just ok compared to the rest of the food, but maybe by time for dessert I was just too full). Our server/s were all a bit odd, hard to put a finger on why exactly, they just seemed out of it and slightly unprofessional, but it was entertaining enough for a Sunday afternoon. Actually, I feel like I went on a vacation for the 2 hrs we spent here--this place reminds me of a fancypants zen-like ski lodge, with plenty of new, intriguing little decor items to feast your eyes on (as if feasting on the food wasn't enough). Can't wait to come back and have a drink on the roof--someday--oh Chicago, someday!!
