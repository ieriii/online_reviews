I went to S.M. for dinner tonight around 7ish, and the line snaked around to the door but moved quickly. The spicy falafel sandwich at dinner was good: fresh pita, good hummus, and "spicy" was indeed spicy. Unfortunately, though, I took a bite of my tabouli before I unwrapped the falafel, and the tabouli had the misfortune of sucking. There weren't many tomatoes or onions, and mint was more or less nonexistent. The worst part was that it was really dry. My girlfriend purloined a lemon slice from the salad bar, but even that wasn't enough to save it. The sandwich was a solid 3, but next time I'll head north to Albany Park when I want falafel.
