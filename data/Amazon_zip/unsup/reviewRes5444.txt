If you're in the mag mile area and you want a kickass meal that will not break the bank but will be pretty effin memorable, consider the Purple Pig. Considering the word of mouth, trendiness of the joint and the legitimately quality dining experience, the wait and the tab were quite reasonable. The wait was half an hour - they wouldn't take reservations, and will seat your party only when everyone is there...communal seating FYI. Come to think of it, the communal part was a bit annoying, because anytime someone in the middle of the tables wants to head out, everyone else needs to shuffle out of their seats - but perhaps this was only for the large outdoor tables we were seated at. Still, sitting outside by the river, perfect evening weather, delicious food....won't complain. The tab was reasonable at about $40 a person after a bottle of wine, and tax/tip and we 3 little piggies were stuffed. We ordered 5 plates and 2 desserts: Antipasti - Beets & Goat Cheese - delish but easily replicable if you have a TJs near you. Smears - Pork Neck Bone Rillette on toast. Zomg. Straight out of a french grocery. So bloody good, and lots of it. The toast was pretty fab too. Milk Braised Pork Shoulder with Mashed Potatoes - the meat was certainly tender but here, i must confess, I don't know what everyone is raving about. It's a fairly bland and simple dish and there were a lot more Wow elements on the menu. Scallop Spiedini with Chickpea Aioli - The scallops had an incredible flavor and sear. Definitely recommend. Octopus with green beans, fingerling potatoes and salsa verde - I have officially never had octopus cooked as perfectly and tenderly as this. High five. The desserts were actually better together - we spooned the hazelnut ice cream with espresso over the Sicilian Iris. To die. So many other things on the many that we were too full to try but that look amazing. Check this place out, it's worth it.
