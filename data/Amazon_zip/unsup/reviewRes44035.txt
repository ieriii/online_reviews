1 Ginger martini, 2 Ginger martini, 3 Gin... Had to stop there- as they got progressively stronger. A perfectly balanced drink with just the right amount of kick. I'd come back for this drink alone. This is definitely a place to see and be seen. People watching at it's finest (and I'm a coniseur of all places to people watch). The atmosphere is understated and sexy. Monotone wood grains and a simple host stand. I dined inside, but there is a patio with a decent amount of tables. Service was a bit... Amplified. We had three people waiting on us who would all stop by and ask the same question within minutes of each other. But hey! A martini glass was never empty and a finished plate never sat for long. Hold on tight to that glass if you're not done! It'll be whisked away before you can take that last sip. I had a seaweed salad, hamachi, and a Dragon Roll. I don't enjoy when eel over powers a roll... But this one was terrific. Officially added to my list of top sushi destinations.
