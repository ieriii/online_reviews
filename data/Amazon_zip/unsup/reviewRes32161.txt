Delicious vegetarian and vegan foods. The only reason I give it 3 stars as opposed to 4 or 5 is because I got the worst stomach ache after I ate there. I think maybe I have a gluten intolerance? Who knows. All I know is that the food was good enough that I kept eating through the pain and finished all of it.
