A BYOB with excellent food and great service--LOVE IT! I have dined in and ordered delivery from here on various occassions, and both experiences are always great. Their food is delicious and they have quite a variety of healthy options in generous portions which I love. When I order delivery, they even often throw in fresh fruit and free smoothies on occassion (nice touch). I am personally a big fan of the shrimp sate and lemongrass chicken, but everything I've ordered here has been tasty.
