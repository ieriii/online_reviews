After walking 1.5miles from the Adler Planetarium to get to the Hyatt the Staff was super friendly even though I looked sweaty and gross with my giant back pack I was lugging around. Everything I would expect from a 4star hotel pool-check sun tanning balcony-check fitness center-check 4different places to eat within the hotel- check King size bed and extra clean +roomy room all a major check. Reason why not 5 stars its a little further away from downtown but the CTA runs right outside the hotel which makes it easy to commute, and no free wifi Come on 10dollars a day?! its 2011 starbucks and coffee shops give free wifi If I'm staying at a 4star hotel I would expect that to be free too but oh well. I would come back when I'm back in town.
