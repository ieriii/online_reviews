Always crowded and loud on the weekends, but if you're patient enough, look forward to tasty coffee and whole multi-grain pancakes. Actually some of the best I've had. Nice variety of fresh fruit (pineapple, strawberries, melon) and veggie selection.The skillet had good potatoes, not as oily or fried as most, however I prefer veggie volume. No silly charge for egg whites. Vegetarian options and lots of variety on the menu. I'd like to go back and try some of the sea food options . Lunch menu is also enticing.
