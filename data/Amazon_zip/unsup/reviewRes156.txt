Alinea, oh yes. I would go here every week if i could, it is so great. From the insanely coiffed sommelier who knows wine as if it flows in his veins, to the extremely knowledgeable waiters, to the serious chef who comes out to prepare the incredible piece of art that becomes an orgy of a dessert....flawless. Grant Achatz is undisputably a genius.  Usually i am pretty wordy in my reviews but Alinea left me sort of speechless and awestruck, if that tells you anything. It's been a month and a half since we ate there and I still think about it and wonder if I'll ever go there again, and find myself plotting ways to get back to Chicago, if only for one more meal here.
