You know that scene in What About Bob (with Bill Murray and Richard Dreyfuss) where Bob is eating corn and fried chicken and going "mmmmm....MMMMM.....MMMMM!!!!!" That was me. Tonight. At Sprout. I have recently dined at Blackbird, Bonsoiree, Avec and Cafe des Architectes. Sprout kicked all their asses handily. HANDILY, my friends. The flavors and pairings were wonderful. The portions were perfect. At the salad course - the first course, I thought, "This meal is on track to be the best one I've had in a long time..." At the 2nd "secret" course, I knew it. I was in the midst of the best meal of my life. My only niggling comment is that my dirty martini was perhaps, not quite dirty enough. I had the Licorice, Venison, and Chocolate. Sounds so simple. 3 courses, the title of each. Yet so insanely delicious. All of the food is organic and seasonal. Probably the best part of the meal was the "cheese course" and the dessert. I don't have the words to describe how wonderful all of the courses were. I know. I'm down right gushing. I think I had a religious experience tonight. That is how good Sprout is. Get thee there pronto, mon ami.
