While on a trip to Chicago, my daughter and I went to Xoco for lunch- first on a Tuesday around 2:00- no wait. We ordered Tortas and Mexican hot chocolate. The sandwiches were great, really special, the hot chocolate was also really good, very rich and thick- A fun treat! The second time was a Friday at Noon, We had about a 45 minute wait. This time we had the Caldo- both were good. We also got the guacamole ahead of time and Churros for dessert. I'm from Austin, Texas and have lived on the border and my mother lives in San Miguel de Allende- I've had amazing quac but this was the best I've ever had. The Churros?? Well let's just say I will dream about the way they tasted with the vanilla bean ice cream for a very long time! Way to go Rick!
