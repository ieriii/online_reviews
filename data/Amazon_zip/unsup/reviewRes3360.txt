My guy and I are wing junkies! I love the tasty morsels of spicy goodness! I heard about crisp from someone after just moving here a year ago, I told him I was a wing junkie! After about 11 months of carrying around a business card with a few places that said guy had given me, I finally tried it. Yesssss! It's exactly what I needed! Spicy, sweet, amazing! Only reason for subtracting one star, I wasn't warned of the portion size! 10 wings means 10 WHOLE wings, no need to order 20 for two people! You are my new fave crisp!!
