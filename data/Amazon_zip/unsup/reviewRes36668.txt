So I came back to have dinner with friends and the food was great as expected. The La Fiesta was on fire and the Osaka (tuna with jalapenos & avocado) was fresh and filling. The service attentive albeit a bit slow in getting us the check, but no biggie. The now have their liquor license so they will charge you a corkage fee which I don't think was a lot considering that so many patrons had brought their own wine. Just one little complaint - Indie Cafe needs to stop being cheap and turn up the heat in that bitch!!! Toward the I was shivering like a Chihuahua!!! The thermostat said 70! C'mon people! You couldn't raise it up to at LEAST 75??? It was 30 degrees out there last night! Some people (like myself) just aren't ready for yet another brutal Chicago winter! Cut us some slack and raise the damn heat!!!
