I have special dietary needs right now (can't eat gluten, nickel, or lectins) and even though they were pretty busy, they accomdated my needs without acting like I was trying to make their lives difficult. The gluten free beer float was yummy and didn't upset my belly :) I'll go there again just to know that I wont have to fight the servers in order to walk out of there feeling good and healthy. Their other vegetarian food looked good, too, mmmm I wanted to dig into that vegan mac n' cheese so bad!
