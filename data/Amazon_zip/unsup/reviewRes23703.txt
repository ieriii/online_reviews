While I was in Chicago for a few days (academic conference), I ate at Lao Sze Chuan 3 times. It's an excellent chinese restaurant. Compared to all the other restaurant that tried in Chicago, this is definitely the best one. I tried more than 20 dishes already (we went in big groups), and I absolutely love the food. If you can take the spice, this is the place to go.
