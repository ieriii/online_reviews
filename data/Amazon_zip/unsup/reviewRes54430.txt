Forget any notions about veggie restaurants not satisfying your hunger if you eat meat. I've dined here a few times, and everything I've tried has been really good.You'll spend a little more, but the quality of the food and service is worth it. Good choice if you're in the neighborhood. Parking can be a challenge, though.
