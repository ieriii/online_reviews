After reading the reviews and reading Anthony Bourdain's 13 places to eat before you die, I was sold, I got there at 9:30 Saturday Morning ( 1 hour before opening) and there was already 10 people in line, I usually am not good waiting in line but every one in the line was upbeat and made great conversation.  Once they opened, the line is slow, but once you get to order you are overwhelmed by amount of options, I ordered the Game of the week ( I think it had bison, Elk and Venison), the Foie Gras dog and also the famous Duck Fat French Fries.  My lord... it was and incredible experience , the Foie Gras dog was very interesting, a duck sausage covered with 3 slices of foie gras, never been a fan of foie gras, but I leaned that I just haven't been eating it correctly because it belongs on a Hot Dog. As for the Game of the week it was a very good sausage, but the real thing that got my attention where the fries.   The best fries I have ever had.... Hot Doug's is a must at least once in you life.
