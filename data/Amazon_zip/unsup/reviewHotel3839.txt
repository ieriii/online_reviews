We were instantaneously greeted the moment we walked in and went up the elevator to get to the hotel reception area, where we met a very friendly Romeo who told us much about the hotel. I love how environmentally constructed the place is! The modern decor is warm yet modern. The interiors makes me feel like I'm at my friend's really nice condo. The room offers bathrobes and slippers. They also carry exfoliating body soap. They have a simple fitness center with very nice machines. The spa tiles are supposedly made out of glass pop bottles. It looks gorgeous. Also, Housekeeping was also really nice. My friend and I felt like we were on vacation, and I live only 10 minutes away!
