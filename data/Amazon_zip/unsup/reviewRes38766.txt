Everything here is amazing! The staff is very friendly and outgoing! The salad buffet is filled with the freshest ingredients, but be careful you can fill up on that and not have enough room for the food. You getsSoup salad, main course and two sides. Plenty of food! The Sausage plate, Piccata and Marsala are all amazing! They have an incredible wine list.
