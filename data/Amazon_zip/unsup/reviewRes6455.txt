I don't even know what else to say about Davanti. I love it. We went here on a whim a few months ago, and the first meal we had cost us about $40 before tip. Not bad for two appetizers, two main entrees, and two desserts. We had steamed asparagus in this ridiculously good mascarpone and pepper sauce, the brioche egg toast, the carbonara risotto (I can't leave without ordering this...we've been here 3x and I've ordered it each time), the linguini with sea urchin, and the chocolate hazlenut mousse and the cannoli sundae. Ridiculously good. The other standouts have been the pork belly pizza and the pork belly. Oh, and the ricotta and honeycomb mason jar. Aaaand the burrata mason jar. Want to try the ragu the next time we go. The service is also great and I love how the place looks.
