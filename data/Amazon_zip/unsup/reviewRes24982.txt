Irazu redefines what you should come to expect from a hole-in-the-wall dining establishment, and I mean that in the most endearing sense. On the unseasonably cool summer night when I ate there, I felt like I was eating in Old Town San Diego. But not to confuse Costa Rican food with Mexican food...the family-style food has a charm and flavor profile all its own. I felt like I was eating authentic home cooking. The cheese empanadas weren't great but they're certainly better than Hot Pockets or mozzarella sticks. I know...not a ringing endorsement. However, the oatmeal shakes were surprisingly good; I can't believe such a shake works, but it does. The Bistec Tico was slightly overcooked in parts, but the fatty, properly cooked morsels were absolutely delicious with the side of beans and rice, plantains, fresh cabbage, tomatoes, and peppers. The portions are gargantuan so come hungry!
