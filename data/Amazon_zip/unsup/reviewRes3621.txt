stopped by, and picked up some wings to go... had the soul sassy and the korean/spicy ones... the wings are HUGE.... and very tasty.. they are crispy, hence the name. Are these as good as my crack addiction like Great Seas? not yet.. i need to sample them more.. they are different too.. they are the entire wing, and Great Seas is lollipop style, and hotter. This place is closer, so they got that going for them.... People working there were really friendly. Will go back and try different sauces and some bowls.
