I enjoyed this hot spot very much. Particularly the ambiance and all the house rules were pretty cool as well (no cell phone use, no standing, etc). I liked this lounge because it was not that loud...I was still able to carry on a decent conversation with light music in the background. I also liked the service.....hmmmmm...maybe because my sister and I got a round of Patron Tequilas on the house!!!!
