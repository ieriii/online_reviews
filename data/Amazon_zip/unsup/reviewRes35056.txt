Sushi X has one of the best happy hour deals in the city -- unfortunately they've slashed it! It used to be half off rolls from 5-7 Sunday - Thursday, but now it's only Sunday and Monday! We went to gorge ourselves on sushi last night, but were really disappointed to see the deal had been cut to Sun/Mon. The maki here is great and an exceptional value during happy hour, but I have a hard time paying full price and will not be going nearly as often as I did before =(
