This place is unique. It has unique sausages, and as a chef Doug has taken the encased meat to the next level, which I applaud. What I don't applaud is him doing foie gras and that whole song and dance, especially after the ban, for his little piece of fame, which is why I vow never to go back and stand in line for this goofy sausage stand, which doesn't even have the best Chicago hot dog in the city -- there are a lot better around, where you don't have and wait in line for hours to get it, and it actually tastes better. Now if you simply can't live without your John Graham Mellor or a Salma Hayek, go, away with you, get thee to the line full of conformity and take solace in the fact that you are there because you truly are a sausage fan, and not a poseur.  And don't get me started on the duck fat fries. Unique, yes, and interesting to try once, but besides being hand cut, I could find nothing amazing to the palatte about these fried tubers, just a different medium for cooking the starch which requires numerous dead ducks.  I might be a bit harsh here, but honestly, if you have anything better to do it isn't worth the pilgrimage and wait through the cult following that Hot Doug's has spawned. Sausage, good. Hot dogs, eh. Fries, just good plain cut fries.
