The lunch buffet here is an excellent deal considering the price. I have not gone in for dinner, but judging by the dishes they put out for the buffet, I am sure it will not disappoint. They will continue to bring out dishes of tandori chicken and nan for as long as you are still eating the buffet. The tandori chicken is not the best I have ever had, but it is still very good. The buffet itself is not always the same dishes, but there is always certainly enough to eat, be you a vegetarian or not.
