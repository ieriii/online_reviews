Really love having this place nearby. Beer is awesome. Coupe D'etat, Cross of Gold, and Bottom Up WIt are my favs. Really looking forward to trying the Milk Stout this year! We go here to grab a drink every now and then, but really happy they are bottling so I can pick up at the liquor store. Also, they have some pretty killer fries.
