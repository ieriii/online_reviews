As a New Yorker, I am partial to thin crust pizza so take this review with a grain of salt.  The pizza itself wasn't anything special. Although it had thick crust, it had no structural integrity; you couldn't eat a slice without a fork or knife. While the sauce was good, the sauce was on top of the cheese so it inhibited the natural progression we know and love with 'normal' pizza. Although I will likely go again, I don't expect to get the pizza again.
