If you come here and just order a hot dog, you're a jerk. There are a million places in Chicago where you can get a good hot dog, please stop clogging up the line. Also, the duck fat fries are beyond overrated. They taste like the regular fries, except they're way worse for your health. People in this city like to tell themselves they can tell a difference, but they can't, they're just being fashionable. That being said, Doug Sohn is a true artist when it comes to encased meats The way he works with sausages and pairs it with the perfect topping makes him, not Abe Froman, the true sausage king of Chicago. Also, if you wait over an hour for it you're a jerk.
