OK so it's a chain, but still a great place to have the occasional steak & scotch with friends. Stiff drinks, prompt and curt service, an upscale sort of vibe. Then they served up my filet mignon and garlic mashed. Things get blurry after tasting the filet, but I think I orgasmed till I passed out.
