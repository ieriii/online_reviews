Now let me establish that I love my hot pot!I studied abroad in Beijing for over a year and tried multiple hot post establishments and loved every single location that I had ever been to.When I showed up to Lao Sze Chuan the waitress was quite unfriendly (which I was accustomed to in Beijing but not USA) and she Immediately took note that I was not Chinese so when I said I wanted hot pot she said OK you want buffet and just walked away. I had to go get her and tell her I wanted to pick the items myself.Once the hot pot arrived i was thoroughly excited but the hot pot which I asked to be spicy was not even near spicy....It also lacked the tongue numbing flower pepper that every hot pot place I had ever been to had in the broth. The pig stomach and intestine were not the Chinese style I was accustomed to and tasted like a local packaged variety...the fish balls and shrimp balls were mediocre at best and the meats were not that great...This restaurant was the biggest letdown of my life and for me that does not happen often. The $50 bill on top of my disappointing meal was also....great.Not recommended...I will continue my search for great hot pot in the US.
