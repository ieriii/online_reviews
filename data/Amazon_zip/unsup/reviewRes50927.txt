I went to Big Jones for their fix prix menu on Thanksgiving, and I wasn't disappointed. Let's go through the Pros and Cons, shall we? Pros: Great atmosphere, though tiny, I liked the feel of the place The crabcake with fried green tomato? AMAZING. There are no other words. It was the best part of the meal, hands down. The salad, with palm hearts and a tasty dressing was pretty good. The steak was cooked to perfection and had good flavor, and was tender The creamed spinach with tomatoes was shockingly excellent Good selection of local beers Cons: Small children in the back room? Seriously, you are going to shove a small child with us back in the cramped "party room"? Not cool. Thankfully the child fell asleep during the meal. They ran out of fried mashed potatoes - which was supposed to come with the steak. I was pretty sad as I had been looking forward to them. The other potato options were fries and hashbrowns. Seriously, with the amount I paid you were going to give me FRIES? I got them, and was highly disappointed. The entrees took FOREVER. At least 30 minutes if not more. We were compensated with a round of free drinks, which was nice. The waitress kept forgetting to bring us water, or ask us if we wanted more beer. I know it was busy, but they had ample staff. At least she was nice. My friend asked for her steak well done, and it was brought out medium rare. I know this is how the steak is "supposed" to be enjoyed, but give the lady what she wants! The steak was already sliced, and we would have had to wait forever for them to fire a whole new steak. There was no whipped cream on the sweet potato pie, which it desperately needed, especially when it was served with a pepper jelly ice cream. Despite the cons, the food was pretty fantastic for the most part. While I may not come back for a fix prix menu again (too pricey) I will DEFINITELY be back on a regular day - especially to get crab cakes or fried green tomatoes again!!!!
