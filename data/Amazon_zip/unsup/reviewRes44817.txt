When I visited Chicago recently, I had only one thing on my mind - dang its cold! Okay, the other thing on my mind was getting a slice of cheesy and thick deep dish pizza for dinner. Staying at the Hyatt on Wacker, I braved the minus zero windchill to visit Giordano's on Lake Street.  I ordered a small deep dish with mushrooms and pepperoni. It was soooo delicious!! The waitress was charming and made the experience the best it could be with her friendliness. I'd come back here again anytime .... and the small is plenty of food for two - even for three. Two slices fills ya uP!
