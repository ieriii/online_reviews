I have been eager to try this place since hearing about it a few years ago from an Italian friend living in Chicago. As previously reviewed, you go here for traditional, authentic pizza, which is the only thing offered on the menu, besides a few appetizer options and dessert. The pizza was definitely tasty, and it was very refreshing to have this kind of unique dining option in North Chicago. We only ended up waiting about 20 minutes on a weekday night. We enjoyed the bresaola pizza special, but thought the marinated anchovy appetizer was so-so (which is actually a few pieces of anchovy on top of a green salad). However, I was disappointed with the poor, slow service. I am not sure if the place is short staffed or what, but it took a long time for the waiter to visit our table to take our initial order after being seated, a long time for the waiter to come back to take our dessert order after giving us the dessert menu, a long time for us to get the check after we requested it. Food came out very promptly after we ordered, so I don't think the kitchen was backed up, just the service. I'm all for European style, relaxed service, but this was not quite right. I am only giving 3 stars for the quality of pizza.
