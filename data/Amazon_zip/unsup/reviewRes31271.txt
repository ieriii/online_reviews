To say I was blown away by this place is an understatement. Went the middle of Nov 2010. The hostesses were beyond nice even tho they were super busy. It was my husbands bday and they had every neurotic detail I requested covered. The bartender made my favorite drink which wasn't on the menu perfectly- she was a blonde woman (didn't catch her name) unbelievably nice. Then Andrea was our waitress- wow. She was so sweet and attentive. She clearly loves working there- it shows. The food: best ahi tuna tartare I've ever had. And the steak sashimi was phenomenal. The oysters Rockefeller had way too much spinach- that's my only negative. The steaks were amazing as anticipated, we practically rolled out of there. Cannot wait to come back soooooo delicious and the customer service is priceless!!
