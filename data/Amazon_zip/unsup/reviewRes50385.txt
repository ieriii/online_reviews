went there just for drinks with 4 co-workers last week. waitress was nice enough but it seemed like she had to many tables as it took her awhile to circle back around to us. prices were reasonable but drinks seemed watered down a bit. if i am in the hood again then ill try some food and update, but it was an ok place with a good scene
