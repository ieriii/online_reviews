This is a wonderful Thai restaurant! I order from it at least once a week. I usually switch up the entrees, but the crag rangoon is awesome, and I always get that. Their curry and pad thai are really wonderful, but I have yet to get a dish that I didn't like. And the entrees are huge; definitely big enough to split between two people. I've dined in once, and the service was fine. I use it more as a take out kind of place, and it's perfect after a long day at work when you really don't want to cook! Absolutely try this place out if you love Thai food!
