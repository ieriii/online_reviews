What's that? You can actually walk up to Doug's, open the door, and walk inside? Apparently the answer is Yes, on a drizzly Wednesday at 11:10 am, when a work crew is reconstructing the curb and sidewalk around the entire corner. Actually, the construction probably had nothing to do with it, but it did add to the strangeness of the scene, namely--NO WAIT at Hot Doug's! Well, there was a line inside of about ten people. Child's play. Thanks to having people in town, deflowering virgins, and various other unusual occasions, I've made it to Doug's four times so far in 2009! Way better than my average. That includes my birthday, because on my birthday I want to do my very favorite things, and that describes Hot Doug's for sure. A day off work, some great company, yummy yummy sausages, and NO WAIT--utter bliss.
