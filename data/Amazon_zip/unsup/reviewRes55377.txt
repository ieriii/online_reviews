The food is fantastic! You can totally tell that its made with so much love and affection. Its fresh and tasty and so different from the regular middle eastern and mediterranean places. The portions are generous and the prices are reasonable. Its a great place for lunch with coworkers or a dinner with family. I've ordered from them a few times as well.Great Food checkFresh and good quality checkFull Bar checkGreat Service checkReasonable Prices checkDelivery and Pickup checkAmbiance checkFree Parking Lot checkSo for all the people who are hesitant to drive to Albany Park don't think no more.
