OMG!!! Yesterday, I went to put in an order for some frozen pizza to take back to CA, I was standing there while at least 4 people were standing around talking to each other ignoring me and some other guy behind me. Then today I went to pick up the order and it happened again. WTF!!! Are you kidding me! Listen, your pizza is good, but I'd rather go to UNO's which is comparable to your pizza and get better customer service. Idiots!
