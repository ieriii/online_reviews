A definitive definition (I know that's redundant, bear with me) of gluttony, or at least a working one, has to be: "Michael G. drunk after a Yelp event spending over $17.00 at Sultan's Market." See, it's almost impossible to spend that much at Sultan's unless you're feeding a harem - or at least a small family. The text that I got when I made this fact public pretty much said it all, "jesus, you can get three falafel sandwiches for $13.00!" And yes, you can get three of almost anything for that much. A small rice and beans, which is what I actually had for dinner that night, rings up at $3.00; and a large is only $4.00. And all of their inexpensive entrees are servicable; albeit not exactly Albany Park authentic quality tastewise. But, see they have this salad bar. Not really a traditional salad bar (though you can create staples of lettuce, tomatoes, and the like) but a full service cold appetizer at a Turkish restaurant bar. And it even contains my little tubes of foodgasm - grape leaves! I'm sure had I only taken a few, the sticker shock (thankfully blunted by how drunk I was) would not have happened. But it's a land of plenty at that salad bar, like I said, so I filled a large carry out container. They also have huge chunks of feta and olives in a portion of the bar that rivals Strack & Van Til. Well, not quite in quantity but definitely in quality. Thankfully I wasn't so deadly sinning that I ate my whole take. It all held up well for lunch the next day. And at the normal prices, being right off the blue line, it actually would serve as a good market to grab lunch and avoid downtown costs. I just have to learn not to go there drunk (it has replaced Flash Taco as my Wicker Park drunken destination) and magically spend $20. It's a skill I haven't learned yet being a glutton for punishment.
