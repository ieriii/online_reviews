Although Fogo de Chao did not quite live up to my expectations it does have some great features that stand out. The service was exceptional and when you have your card green the food just keeps coming...which leads to the 2nd great feature, you will absolutely not leave hungry. Further, there is enough variety to keep things interesting. The salad bar is also great, although I refrained from consuming too much vegetation, the focus is really on the meat, as it should be. Finally, the atmosphere is energetic and fun. It is a great place to go in a group. Overall I did have a great time and I would go back, however, the quality of the steaks was simply not top notch. I have definitely had better steaks at some of the many reputable steak houses around Chicago such as Gibsons, Chop House, and Gene and Georgettis, etc...
