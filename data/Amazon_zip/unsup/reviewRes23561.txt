I stumbled upon Icosium Kafe after a hair cut in this neck of the woods one night and I was so glad I did! The staff is friendly, the food is different and the prices are pretty good for what you're getting (but be prepared for an additional $2.99 charge when you add meat). All the savory crepes looked so good that I couldn't choose, so I asked the waitress which one she'd recommend if I wanted to try merguez (Algerian lamb sausage). She suggested the Marrakech and I ate the entire thing. There was, literally, nothing left on my plate. You also can't go wrong with any of the sweet crepes.
