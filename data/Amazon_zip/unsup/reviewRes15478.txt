Last night we decided to celebrate my partner passing his first test. So, we decided to go to Calo. We made a reservation, got there about 20 min early, and was actually seated on time. After being seated, we were brought water and bread. Then our waitress took our orders. We started off with fried calamari. Delicious. Then I had New England clam chowder and my partner had salad. Then for the main course, I had crepes stuffed with chicken, spinach, and a white sauce. My partner had their grilled octopus. Everything was amazing. Service was great. The evening was perfect. Can't wait to go back!!!
