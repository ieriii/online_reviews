Minus one star for the decrease in the quality of the pho. It's still pretty good, but the broth used to be very beefy and had a lot of body. It feels a bit watered down these days. Minus one star for the price increases. When Tank was on Argyle in 2004, the large bowl was $6.95, which was in line with other places. When they got the new place on the corner of Argyle and Broadway and got the new menu, the price went up a buck, which was fine, as it was the best pho in town and deserved a price premium. Then it went to $8.95. And now it's $10.95. I have never, ever seen a bowl of pho over $10, even in the very best places in San Jose and Westminster in California. And no one should ever pay $10.95 for a bowl of pho. It feels like Tank is taking advantage of their customers, especially ones that have stuck with Tank through the years. Compare this to another neighborhood success story, Ba Le, where prices have only gone up about $0.50 for a sandwich, which is in line with inflation. I wish Tank the best of luck, but I'm going to be taking my business elsewhere, like Le's down the block.
