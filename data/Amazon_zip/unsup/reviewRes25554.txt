Went here for dessert after a bad, overpriced dinner at Pegasus (ugh). Was very impressed at the bakery offerings and the full service restaurant they operate. My wife and I were drooling at the big portions of Athenian chicken and lamb that were being served right next to us as we ate our pastry. We promised each other that we would eat here the next trip back to Greektown. Based on what I ate and saw the prices were right at this gem of a place in Greektown. I'm a fan.
