We were in Chicago for a wedding and opted to do Chicago-y things while we were there, hitting up Michigan Ave and Navy Pier. We stopped in Giordano's for lunch because it's a classic Chicago meal. It was just ok. We waited for about 15 minutes for a table which wasn't bad, and we had to wait about 35 minutes for the pizza, but understandably that's because they have to bake it. The toppings were skimped on, but it was good. It just wasn't great and something I have to rave about. I mean, I like cheese and all. Being from Milwaukee, we get a bad rap about putting cheese on everything. For the record, we did NOT come up with pizza stuffed with an extra two pounds of cheese. After about 30 minutes to an hour, the extra couple pounds of cheese you consumed will catch up with you in some unpleasant form...the least of which is requiring a nap, the middle version is a cheese rock in your stomach, the worst of which I won't discuss here. So, go to Giordano's, because it's a classic place to go. Don't go for the best pizza you've ever had. Plan a couple hours afterwards for a nap.
