We go to the Blue's Bar / Oyster Bar and the Th's the music is really lively. I had the Alaskan Snow Crab Legs for my bday in November and I was blown away. The bread, the fish, the Lobster Bisque soup, the service are top notch! it is a great date place............the only thing I don't care for is the sushi.........check it out!
