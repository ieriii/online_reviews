I used to love the old Uncommon Ground on Clark. Now I don't like either location. Their food used to be delicious and reasonably priced, but that went out the window when they expanded the old location then opened the new one. Now the food is overpriced and mediocre at best. This time I got arugula pesto flatbread -- tasteless. Isn't pesto supposed to have garlic in it?? I also tried my friend's fried fish, which was dry and overcooked. The only thing I really liked was the sweet potato fries, which were above average. The band never showed up that night, which isn't the restaurant's fault, but considering we were a large party (six) who had made a reservation specifically in the music room, it was poor customer service that they offered no sort of adjustment -- a small discount, taking an appetizer off the bill, or some sort of gesture acknowledging that we'd spent a lot of money eating and drinking there in order to hear music that didn't happen.  I don't plan to ever go there again. You can get food twice as good for half the money by heading a few blocks west for some Indian food!
