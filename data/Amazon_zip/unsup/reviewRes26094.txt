If you don't mind dropping a bit of cash, Geja's is a great bet for a romantic dinner. We've frequented this restaurant for special occasions for 10 years and still love it. The portions seem like they've gotten a bit smaller (amount of meat and seafood), but we're always full when the meal is over, so I guess it's not such a huge deal. Nothing stands out as hugely ambitious on the menu, since we've made fondue at home and found it to be pretty easy, but it's a nice change to the norm, in terms of offerings. Tips: Try to get a booth as there is quite a bit of foot traffic and the space is tiny. Also, the earlier you go, the more likely you'll be able to get that romantic secluded vibe.
