Yay breakfast food! Yay close enough to work that I can go there for lunch! Yay tasty tasty food! I've never had to wait, then again - I go on weekdays. The first time I went I nearly passed out I was so hungry... so when it was absolutely amazing I thought it might just be the hunger... but the next time was just as good. The only trouble I have is the potatoes are a little undercooked for me.
