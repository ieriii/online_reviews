So, I'm a little slow to try out restaurants that are hot. Perhaps it is in my favor. A recent visit at 1:30 led to minimal wait times to order and no waiting for a seat. Brilliant! In any event, I don't have any earth shattering news to report that hasn't been noted (holy moley, 431 reviews?!) but I like to write, so I'll give my two cents, whether warranted or not. When it came time to celebrate my pal's birthday, I suggested XOCO. This was both my and my lunch date's first Rick Bayless experience. (Well, unless you count the Frontera Fresco at the Macy's food court, which is actually quite good.) Let me just tell you one aspect that I love: FREE BUBBLY WATER. Seriously. Serve yourself, put some ice in a real glass, a slice of lime and you can feel fancy. I love that. We started with the chips and guacamole, because, even as an Irish-German lass, I can whip up a mean guacamole and have the taste buds to tell whether the guac is solid. Win here. No shocker. Good salsa, yummy chips. For $4, this was a great start. My torta (Wednesday's special) was excellent. I mean come one, pork on pork always equals awesome in my world. A dark salsa glazed my meaty, not fatty, pork belly, topped with crisp bacon, arugula, queso anejo (not entirely sure what it is....but it was awesome). It was perfect. The birthday boy had the pepito, cuz, come on, braised short ribs are up there in the "meat desirability chart" and he polished his off cleanly as well. No leftovers for us. Yeah, the seating kinda sucks (I was acutely aware of the size of the gentleman's thigh seated directly to my right. I don't think his wife was really happy about that.) and it's pricey, but it is a delicious dining experience. Sadly, it's not one that I'll be able to afford that often, but I will be back. After all, I must try the caldos!
