I was watching a show on the Travel Channel the other day about infamous hot dog places across the United States, and Superdawg was featured. This reminded me that I haven't been to Superdawg in a while, so I made the trip. The pros: The winking hot dog statues on the roof are one of a kind. The food tastes great. The hot dog lounger boxes are quite amusing. The fact that they have drive-in stalls also garners points because it is just something you don't see much anymore, unless you have a Sonic in your neighborhood. All in all, a solid Chicago hot dog stop even if it is a little overhyped. The cons: Superdawg is hard to get to because it is at the intersection of three major thoroughfares. Getting in there during rush hour is tough. Not to mention, the popularity of the place makes it like a hornet's nest. There are cheaper places to get hot dogs and other greasy treats. The staple Superdawg comes to $4.86 with tax. (It is a jumbo dog and it does come with a few fries, but still that is pricey for what you get.) Keep in mind this is one of the cheapest items on the whole menu as well. I'd say everyone has to go to Superdawg at least once because it is a semi-famous hot dog joint. It would be a great place to take out-of-towners. The inaccessability and the fact that there are plenty of other great (and cheaper) hot dog places in Chicagoland make it not a habitual hangout for myself.
