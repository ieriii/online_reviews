We love this place! The food and the margaritas are delicious! It's great for families with young kids too. Tasty chips and salsa, yummy quacamole with onion. My husband loves the chorizo burrito and the strawberry margaritas on the rocks. The kids (6 yrs and 2 yrs) and I love the chicken quesadilla meal. Make sure to ask for the quacamole on the side, otherwise they put it inside and then they're not as good to reheat as leftovers. The rice and beans are fresh and tasty. I also really like the steak taco salad. The steak tastes like fajita steak with grilled onions, chihuaha cheese, jalapenos, tomato and lettuce in a crispy taco bowl. Not too big, just the right size so I don't feel like I've over eaten. And the strawberry margaritas, on the rocks, are amazing!  We go to dinner earlier on the weekend so we can bring the kids and it won't be too crowded.
