The Gastro Pub comes to Chicago at last. I wish I had some other GP to compare the Gage against, but alas, an attempt to eat at the Spotted Pig in West Village failed. The decor is quite nice and during dinner--since they didn't have cable yet--I got to watch "The Searchers". I imagine the lovely flat panels now play sports exclusively. I had the duck confit--it was adequate (the leg was not very impressive in either flavor or texture) and the huckleberry reduction an inspired touch. I'm simply not sure what makes it stand out--certainly Chicago takes center stage with innovative cookery (Alinea, Schwa), so I was expecting a bit more, at least in presentation. My hostess was quite friendly and not overbearing.
