I love this hotel -- even though the first time I stayed here, I rolled off the bus, hungover and half-awake into a very dark lobby and couldn't find the right elevator to get to my room... It's a cute boutique hotel on Wacker on the South side of the river, but close enough to everything downtown (Miracle Mile... Navy Pier, blahblahblah). It's also in close proximity to the El so getting to Northern neighborhoods (i.e. Wrigleyville, Boystown -- Halstead) is easy enough.
