I walked here with a friend from the Ogilvie Transportation Center (~2 miles)...in the rain. BUT IT WAS WORTH IT!  The homemade potato chips and the sweet pickles were amazing! I'm not normally a pickle person, but these pickles were so good - I couldn't get enough. My friend and I started off with the smoked dry-rubbed wings. So savory! Whenever I come back, I will definitely get them again. We then moved onto the q2 - we chose pulled pork & a half slab of St. Louis ribs. It came with honey sweet cornbread (which I loved) and four sauces - BBQ, spicy, a vinegar, and a mustard - ALL delicious. I especially liked the mustard and BBQ. The pulled pork was really good with the sauces. We also shared a side of the bruleed macaroni & cheese = yum yum yum!!! In the end, it was quite a lot of food and we had enough left over for a third person. I am looking forward to eating those leftovers!
