LOVE, LOVE, LOVE Irazu...and it is BYOB!! Seriously, why did I just go there for the first time this summer...I've known about this place for so long. I had the veggie burrito; i completely understand why it is award winning. It was so flavorful, delicious, and HUGE! The side plantains were perfect and the rice was light and fluffy; just how it tasted in Costa Rica. I can't wait to go back for more entree sampling. If you like Costa Rican food...go now. The ONLY thing that I would change is for them to find a substitute for the paper liner in the burrito basket. The juices from the burrito make the paper wet and my attempts at lady-like behavior (cutting it with a knife), ripped the paper and I'm pretty sure small pieces got mixed into the burrito. Oh..remember...CASH ONLY!
