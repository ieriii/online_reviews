Fantastic place overall. I/we usually get the same thing(chicken tikka masala and chicken vindaloo). Tikka masala has more flavor and tastier than the vindaloo while vindaloo is bit more spicier. Only downside I can think of is it can get pricey due to the location of the restaurant(it is in prime location so everything is relative). You have to order rice and naan ala carte. Also, parking is ridiculously expensive in the area and its not the restaurant's fault. I still come because food is good and at least once a month, I need a good internal flushing of the human organs. Solid restaurant overall. Would definitely recommend.
