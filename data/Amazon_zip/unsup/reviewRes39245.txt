Extremely happy that a good friend recommended this restaurant for brunch. Considering that my friend is a great cook and has a great sense for fantastic cuisine, my wife and I came in with very high expectations and where still blow away. We were asked to wait 20 minutes so we decided to each have a bloody mary. Once seated we were greeted within minutes. We looked at the menu and were very impressed with what we saw. We chose to start our meal with the golden raisin & vanilla Scone with clotted cream & honey. This was freshly baked and extremely delicious.  My wife had the deconstructed clam chowder with seared pork belly. She gave that dish 5 stars herself. I had the new item on the menu which was the whole hog head over cheesy grits and bacon fat cooked brussel sprouts! Another 5 stars! Overall, the experience was exactly what we needed on that day and we look forward to going back and trying a new menu item!
