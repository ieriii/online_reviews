heard alot about this place and pass it all the time...finally decided to try it out. Well, went inside and the place was packed for a Friday night. Didn't want to eat, just wanted to drink and play some shuffle board so we stood around at the bar area. Shuffle board was occupied so finally a few seats at the bar opened up. Bartender gave me the BEER menu.....holy cripe! I was just in the mood for a Miller Lite...which they do not serve. So, what do I get? I had no clue, there were so many beers to choose from, so I put my choice in the hands of the bartender. Told her I wanted something in a bottle that was light. She suggested Weinerschneizleackstein!!!! just kidding....it was called WEIHENSTEPHANER! the bartedner called it the "Gwen Stefani!" Much easier to remember!  Over all, a nice bar good crowd......tv set up was just OK. Could use a few more tv's and not play UFC. Didn't try the food, but head it was very good. I will be back........and to play shuffleboard!!!
