The Pasta Bowl is an unexpected gem in Lincoln Park. Unpretentious, welcoming, cheap and comforting food with great portions. All of the pastas I have tried have been really surprisingly good with fresh ingredients and a ton of flavor. They tend towards the heavier side (you can't go wrong with any cream sauce) but they do have tasty, healthy options. This place doesn't have a ton of space inside, as it shares the store front with an attached bar but that just gives it a cozy feel. Its a grab a drink, a bowl of pasta and your friends kind of place. The service is not always spot on but the food is. My only other compliant is that they are not open late enough!
