My husband dragged me here which is the only reason I returned, and I'll give you this-- the food was good. Great even. But the other patrons seriously made me want to stab myself in the eye.  It was mid afternoon in Wicker Park but you would have sworn it was 11:30pm at Rockit.  (shudders) Send me a take out menu.
