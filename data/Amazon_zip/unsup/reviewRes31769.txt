Been here twice- one with a friend and the second time with clients as a big group. Both times, the food was delicious, very well presented, recommendations from the servers were spot on and service was impeccable. The restaurant's ambience is very trendy, communal dining can be fun if you're a small group but they do well to accommodate bigger parties too. It's definitely one of the new places in town and very trendy indeed. Attractive staff, attentiveness to detail in service as well as the fabulous ambience make it worth the visit.
