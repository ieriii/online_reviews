Bless you, Good Yelpers; you've not yet let me down. I met a friend at Mayan Palace last night, and we were both shocked at how good it was, despite all the raving reviews we'd read beforehand. The staff is warm and friendly, even when they have to fight through a crowd of people waiting for tables at the bar. Two men greeted me at the door and told me it'd be about 20 minutes before we got a table, and within 10 minutes, we had fresh margaritas from the bar (omg BANANA) and were seated at our table. My friend and I split the queso fundido, which was dripping with healthy deliciousness and served with piping hot tortillas, followed by my chicken enchiladas suizas and her combo platter. I can't speak to hers--and it was so smothered with food from edge to edge that I couldn't even tell you what all was on it--but my enchiladas were good. And I say only good because the sauce tasted more than a little like barbecue sauce (there goes that star), which I can respect as a Kansas City native, but not in my Mexican food, please and thank-you. Charming dcor, great food and service that never suffered at the demands of a HUGE weeknight crowd earn Mayan Palace four happy stars from me!
