My girlfriend and I reserve this as a "special" dinner place for certain occasions. Tremendous neopolitan pizza, great insalata mista, and easily the best limoncello anywhere. It's tough to get a table at prime time on a weekend - go there on a weeknight. One of the fun things about going here for is how relaxed and happy all the patrons seem. The owner is very nice, too, and will visit your table if things aren't too busy.
