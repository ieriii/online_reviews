I came here with my girl for Sunday brunch with no reservations. We were seated immediately with an option of seats at the communal table or the bar. We decided to sit at the bar. I started this blessed day with a Publican Mimosa. I could've drank these all day. I ordered the duck-confit hash and their maple syrup-braised Publican bacon. She ordered the quiche and hash browns. For the record, the Publican bacon is one of the best strips of bacon I've ever had. It's comparable to the bacon at Peter Luger's in BK. I cannot stress this enough...no matter what you order...make sure you get the Publican bacon. The duck-confit hash really hit the spot. The yolks on my fried eggs were the perfect amount of runny. After seeing them make dozens of Bloody Mary's behind the bar I decided to order one. It came with a sidecar of my choice of beer (among 3). The bloody mary was on-point. I now knew why they were being dished out like hotcakes. I tried the quiche...it tasted very fresh. The hash browns were very crispy.  As I neared my last bites, I slowed down...not because I was full...but because I didn't want it to end. Am I the only one who plans what is going to be on their spoon for the "last bite" of their meal? Runny yolk, hash brown, publican bacon....heaven. OK I LIED...my last bites were out of their amazing PECAN STICKY BUNS. Holy S#!Tb@ll$ ! So soft...so sweet...these sticky buns were OUTTA CONTROL! The service was great. The ambiance was classy-cool. Two songs I vividly remember hearing on blast while gnoshing were BelBivDevoe's Poison, and Huey Lewis & The News' Power of Love. What else could you possibly want to hear during Sunday brunch?! Get over to Publican's brunch...ASAP.
