Um...they forgot to deliver my wedding cake. I picked out a delicious cupcake tier and groom's cake and they completely forgot to bring them to my wedding venue. My father had to call the bakery during dinner and thankfully he got a hold of someone who rushed them over. This is all very bad but I really do like cake and was a pretty laid back bride so if the post-debacle follow through had been better I might still find it within me to acknowledge that mistakes do happen and the cupcakes are, after all, pretty god damn tasty. But the personal touch and apology just was not there. Sure, my contact at the bakery apologized but only because we dragged it out of him and I just don't feel like they really cared or felt that bad their mistake. In the end, I still love the cupcakes but am hesitant to recommend this bakery to anyone who is looking to cater a special event. Great food but the customer care is definitely suspect.
