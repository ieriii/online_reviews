Over the top and amazing. When I saw that this place was ranked higher than French Laundry on the Gourmet Magazine list of top 50 restaurants, I knew that I had to go. We had the "tour" menu which was 23 courses and the wine pairing. At 9:30pm on a Thursday night, we started our "tour" and we left the restuarant a little before 2am having experienced an explosive array of flavors and combinations. I have to admit, I was tired and sleep deprived from the flight that day so I slept through course 21(even though Paul tried to wake me up) and somehow woke up with chocolate on my face, but it definately wasn't due to the lack of innovative and delicious flavors. Ok, not bad I managed to have 22/23 courses. :)
