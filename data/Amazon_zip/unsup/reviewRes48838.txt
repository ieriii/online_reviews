After hearing and reading SO MUCH about this place, I finally tried it out on a Monday night with a few friends. I was not impressed at all. Food - We tried our best to order a varity (which was hard on a menu showcasing 10 different pig body parts). We ended up ordering the heirloom apple salad, aioli, scallops, farm chicken, 3 hams, and a vegetarian entree...all were ok..but nothing special. Surprisingly, my veggies turned out to be the best dish. Overall, the flavors were too rustic and not interesting in any way. Our waiter made it a point to emphasize the use of "local" fresh ingredients. Thanks, but I don't really need to know proximity of their slaughterhouse...what century is this...meat is supposed to be a mysterious yummy phenomenon...I find the details a little too disturbing . I was expecting better from the Avec/Blackbird team. I mean...seriously...at least get the food right. Ambiance/Decor- I commend the effort to create something unique...but the ideas were not executed tastefully. I felt like I was at a farm house. It all seemed a little too tacky and lacked any sophistication whatsoever. I got the impression that they were trying too hard and allowed their creativity to override practicality and good sense. Also, I'm thinking communal dining isn't as cool as they think. Dimmer lighting could have made a huge difference. Service - Friendly...but a bit juvenille. p.s. the butcher get ups are not hip. Bottom line, this place did NOT live up to all the hype (i give three stars because i've never given anyting lower...what can i say...i'm too nice).
