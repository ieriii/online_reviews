We've heard enough about this place, so we finally came here for brunch. It's surprising that Bridgeport would have such a nice brunch place. First off, the service was great. Everyone was friendly and polite, which is more than what you can ask for on any busy Sunday brunch morning. But the food...oh, the food is what makes this place great. Check out their website for a more detailed menu, but these guys should definitely be given some props for presentation. All of the dishes we saw looked beautiful. My wife ordered the stuffed french toast with poached pear and raspberries. I got the roasted apple and gingerbreak pancakes. Both were nicely presented and tasted great. Their lunch / dinner entrees caught our eyes, so we may be back in the future to try to their grilled laughing bird shrimp and fried oyster po'boy.
