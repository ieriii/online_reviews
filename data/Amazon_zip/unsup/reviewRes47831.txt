This is one of those gimmicky places where you go to have a "unique" dining experience. You start out with the harvest table, which is a glorified buffet with about 50 different dishes on it. They all look great, and the little description cards make them sound great, but the flavors just aren't there. Maybe because they've been sitting on a table all night. Another problem with the concept is that it's hard to remember which dishes you liked, like the one piece of cheese that I had. And you eat way too much. Next, they bring out the huge skewers of meat; the Wagyu beef was the only one that really stood out. The place has an ultra-chic, contemporary vibe, which surely goes over well with the River North/Lincoln Park lamestreamers who hang here, but to me it felt cliched. Save your money for a real dining experience.
