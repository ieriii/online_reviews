Great BYOB. We've been many times and are never disappointed. I take friends when they are in town when we want byob and a good value and they are always thoroughly satisfied. The Lemongrass chicken rocks!! And the spring rolls are so fun because you roll your own at the table. They have an avocado smoothy which sounds weird but is sooo tasty! Went with my girlfriend recently and they had a special 3 course menu. It was a great price so we went for it and ended up trying things we wouldn't have ordered. Lets just say the papaya salad knocked our socks off. So fresh tasting with shrimp and crisp veggies in a delicious sauce. Happy we branched out. The service is always great and the older man (pretty sure he is the owner) is so friendly and welcoming. Give it a try if you want great Vietnamese in Lincoln park. Or if you want a new BYOB place. Or if you have a large group and want something casual and fun.
