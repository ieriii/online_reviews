day-after-Thanksgiving-dinner Table for 6, around 9pm on a Friday night. We had a reservation and were seated almost immediately. Service was good, although it took him a while to take our drink orders. We ordered our food first and asked for another minute to review the drink list, but ended up waiting for close to 15 minutes. I also felt like the food came out too fast and in quick succession. We were constantly eating with barely any down time in between plates, so it wasn't as leisurely as I would have liked it to be. But can't complain too much about fast service, I suppose... acorn squash - with maple butter, pumpkin seeds, and crispy sage. Tasty, but small. The seeds elevated this dish which was dangerously close to being plain. scallops - parsnip puree, pomegranate, and truffled peach olives. tuscan fish stew - mussels, clams, shrimp, kale, tomatoes and garlic bread. Hearty, flavorful. The soggy bread almost outdid the fish (...or maybe it did) dover sole - sweet potatoes, caperberries, fried shallots, and brown butter. Most interesting fish preparation I've had in a while. Normally a whole fish is simply prepared with lemon and herbs (which I adore), so it was a nice change to have less ordinary garnishes and strong flavors supporting the sole. Fantastic dish. potee - pork tenderloin, toulouse sausage, turkey leg, horseradish aioli. pork belly - black beans, celery root, cucumbers, and queso fresco. Loved the preparation of the pork belly with extra crispy skin. Another dish with interesting supporting flavors. Overall I found everything to be delicious. The seasoning was on the verge of being too salty, but didn't cross over the line. The space was great for a group of our size, but the plates were often difficult to split because portions were oftentimes small. I found myself wanting more than my share at times BUT this type of setup allowed for the opportunity to sample many different dishes.... so it comes with the territory.
