I love Cubans! This place is pretty good. The coconut shrimp was a hit and so was the salmon and the steaks and the pork. And you can't go wrong with alcohol. No one really had a bad meal and I would recommend going again. If you want to hang out all night I would recommend going after 7pm. If you are starving and want a meal served fast go before 7pm.
