I dined here w/ friends on a recent Saturday evening. We had superb service and an excellent meal. I would recommend having reservations and dining early in the evening. We had a reservation for 5:45 but arrived at 5:30 and were seated immediately although by the time we left at around 7, the place was bustling and there were people in the lobby and outside the main entrance waiting to be seated. The Calamari Fritti is to die for. All of our appetizers and entrees were served piping hot and presented beautifully. For an entree I ordered the Gnocchi Asiago which was a variation for me because I normally go for one of the other two varieties of Gnocchi offered at Calo. These Gnocchi were the most melt-in-your-mouth delicious potato pasta "pillows' I have ever tasted. Not in the least bit doughy as some Gnocchi I have sampled elsewhere. Try the Tartufo for desert (the chocolate one) and you will think you've died and gone to heaven. The only thing lacking was that they did not have the necessary Pomegranate juice needed to make my friend's favorite cocktail, a Nantucket Fire-crotch.
