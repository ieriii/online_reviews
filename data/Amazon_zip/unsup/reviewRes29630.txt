This shit is bananas. (I know you just sang b-a-n-a-n-a-s in your head. Don't even act like you didn't.) That said, it's very good bananas indeed (just to clarify). As our house is essentially missing a rather large chunk (oh, renovations! You're so silly!), my husband and kids decided to take me out for an early birthday celebration so I didn't have to gaze around my insanely messy house in a semi-catatonic state. One of the stops included an early lunch at The Chicago Diner (my favorite restaurant). The sweet potato fries are ridiculously delicious. Never soggy, always sweet potato-y...just perfection. You can never go wrong with a "milkshake", either. But the most amazing part of today's meal: the pesto "chicken" sandwich. While I'm not normally a huge "fake meat" fan, this could change my ways entirely. It's quite possibly the most amazing mock meat experience I've ever had. Ever. And I'm picky as hell. So this really says a lot. The only thing I would do next time is skip the cheese because I think it took away from the beautiful blend of flavors. But I will probably never order another dish off the menu. You *have* to try it. I'd still pass on things like the macaroni and cheeze & the BBQ "bacon" cheezeburger as neither of those things really lit my fire, so to speak. But this beauty of a sandwich more than makes up for it. Chock up another solid meal to the Chicago Diner. Win, win, win.
