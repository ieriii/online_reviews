I really wanted to like this place, so much so that I've been back multiple times to try and change my opinion. The menu and concept seemed like a hit, combine that with the chef/proprietor's experience at French Laundry, I thought this was an automatic 5 yelpstar. First impression walking in is this place seems very dark and cluttered, I don't love the interior. There are a few cool aspects (the lighting fixtures for instance), but I guess the interior design theme which is shabby chique crossed with a rummage sale isn't up my alley. Occasional there is a strobe light or flashing imagery on the wall as well, not really something I'm looking for while enjoying a meal. Also for a somewhat wide open space, the tables do seemed cramped together. I found myself unintentionally ease dropping on neighboring conversations. The food was a major disappointment. I found the pasta dishes to be very oily/buttery, the veggie dishes were decent and the only standout out of the half dozen dishes we had was the pot roast. 1 for 6 might be good for baseball, well not really unless you are a pitcher at the plate...either way it doesn't cut it for an alumni of French Laundry. Service here is subpar as well, which I believe is a function of being understaffed. Even the bartenders/mixologists were underwhelming to say the least. For a place that has received quite the buzz for their cocktails (think Violet Hour), I was almost insulted when I went to the bar. Me - So what do you recommend for a drink, I'm a vodka guy..... Bartender - How about a vodka tonic? Me - Really, that's it? I was hoping for something a little more exotic, after all I have heard you guys make unique cocktails Bartender - Oh yea....guess you're right, sorry just feeling lazy I guess the silver lining was at least he was being honest, either way I still left with a vodka tonic that I could have ordered from Duffys and not known the difference.
