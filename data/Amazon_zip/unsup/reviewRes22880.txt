We asked the waiter what was good for dinner (steak options) and he recommended the first three dishes Casado, Bistec tico (what I had), and the Onioned steak which all range from $11-$13. I would also add the fourth item - the grilled steak. All of the seven or eight girls I was with had one of those four dishes and once the food came - we were all silent (mouths were nice-n-full of steak)!! Everything was delicious and the portions were huge!!  Me and one of the girls I came here with tried to come here on a Sunday night to satisfy our craving for a steak with a latin flare BUT IT WAS C-L-O-S-E-D. We ended up at Cafe 28 which was okay, but you get waaaay more bang for your buck at Irazu!!! :) The place is small and cozy, but as a party of eight we had a picnic style table with long benches - so we had to squish in and keep our posture (no back support), but it worked out. The other tables are smaller and have normal chairs.  The waiter was attentive and patient especially considering our large party. Made lots of reccomendations for us. Warning - they claim to have the best rice pudding but I would disagree (Standard Indian Restaurant does - hands down!). The rice was hard and hard to chew. Oh and they are BYOB! I will be returning VERY soon to make up for the Sunday they were closed.
