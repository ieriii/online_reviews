Great food, poor service. I go to Yolk in the early weekday mornings to avoid the weekend rush. Lately I feel like I'm continually touching the hot stove with the service.  Usually there are no more than 8 patrons there when I go so you'd think service would be exceptional! Wrong. You're lucky to get a coffee refill. The wait staff tends to be more engaged with their personal conversations at the bar rather than occasionally checking on the customers. I went my entire meal, read the paper, and sat at my booth for 10 minutes waiting for the check without seeing the waitress again. This isn't an isolated inncident either. It's usually not that bad but still way below par. The wait staff is the face of your restaurant. The food is great but service like that has me leaving annoyed enough to write a poor review on Yelp.
