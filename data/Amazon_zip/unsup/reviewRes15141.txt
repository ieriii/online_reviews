Superb. I'm a big brewpub fan and this one has never disappointed. The menu is seasonal and has changed by the next time I return. Have yet to try the pizza but every other entree I've had has been excellent. Prices are a bit higher than the competition, but Revolution makes it a point to note the quality of their ingredients which more than justifies the price. The beer is lovely, more experimental and seasonal than Piece in my opinion. I'm rarely out in Logan Square but this is a worthy of "destination spot" classification for sure.
