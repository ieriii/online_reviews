Just finished BREAKFAST there. Wow! Screw the generic, mass-produced, baked goods at Starbucks...the Lime/Ginger and Maple/Pecan muffins here are awesome. More chewy than fluffy, I could eat them all day. The scrambled-egg empanadas and ham/poblano bread pudding were egg-ceptional. Both were light & fluffy with just a little heat. Rick was behind the counter, chopping cilantro. We'll be back.
