The little I know about Catalan is that Catalan likes differentiating themselves from rest of Spain... though I don't know enough about either to be able to tell the difference between one tapas vs another. Cafe amb llet anyone? First story bar is very dark and cozy (kind of W-esque), but when you go upstairs, the ceilings are high, huge mirrored walls and the place just seems huge. They have this weird parenthases shaped seating right by the stairs that they filled with couples -- my friends and i sat in the regular area (cute chairs btw).   All the drinks look really enticing -- tried two (spiced sangria and muddled fruit/vodka concoction) and they were yum.  The food reminds me of the American Express commercial where the service was great, the food was ... small (elf food). Definitely smaller daintier portions than any of the other tapas places I've been. The batatas bravas came out tiny and in a little row. All the food was very good though. The 4 chocolate dessert hit the spot too - white hot chocolate real sweet, a chocolate mousse that was less sweet, a chocolate cake with a tart sour powder on top, and a walnut milk ice cream which was surprisingly good. I plan to go back :)
