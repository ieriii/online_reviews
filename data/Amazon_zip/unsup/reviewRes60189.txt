I LOVE this place!! It's not just because of the convience, the super pleasant staff, or the fact that they have a nice flat screen for me to watch the games while I wait for my pizza. Their pizza is amazing...the ingredients are fresh, the dough light but tasty, and they have so much variety that my biggest issue is chosing a favorite. Ok...that's a lie...my favs are the brocolli and the margherita. Oh, and this is so much more than just pizza joint. Their grilled chicken, rice, beans and other sides tastes like something I would eat at a home. So whether I want something fast and carb-loaded or just a big salad with a side of chicken...this place ALWAYS satisfies and exceeds my expectations! I'm so glad I stopped in...keep up the quality and you'll have me as a customer for life. By the way, try the "cochina"...it's like a chicken fille, potato ball of goodness....
