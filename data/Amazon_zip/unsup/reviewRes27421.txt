Nuevo Leon is always bustling. It's a very casual restaurant that resembles a busy high school cafeteria. There are tons of people everywhere and you can't quite tell what line to wait in. It's extremely noisy. Very diverse crowd - families, hipsters, grandmas, yups, you name it, they go here. The menu is pretty standard fare and competitively priced. The food resembles that of what you would think a home cooked meal would be like. The food is good but not great. I find that it is a little bland for my taste (I like really spicy food and marinated meat and such). The service is a hit or miss, especially when busy. Most of the time you will be waiting for your check. I find this to be a good place to bring groups who aren't necessarily foodies and want a casual meal that's not in in yuppietown Chicago. Make sure to bring cash as this is a cash only joint. Street parking is available - pay box.
