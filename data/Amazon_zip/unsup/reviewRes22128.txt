Oatmeal shake was DELICIOUS: basically a liquid oatmeal cookie. Service was super friendly and all of the food was homemade and delicious. The chips are made in-house and were thick and crunchy with a hint of lime. This was my first trip to a Costa Rican restaurant and I thoroughly enjoyed it, I'll definitely be back again to sample their other dishes.
