Woot woot - L&E is now on my list of fav restaurants in Chicago!! Hubby and me were here for dinner last night. When we got there it was packed and the hostess said there was a wait of around 45 mins. We decided to stick it out and while we were browsing their enormous drinks menu, she said our table was ready. We waited probably a total of 15 mins. When I think of a Michelin - star restaurant, this is not what comes to mind. It is a totally unassuming, hipster gastropub with a sense of humor. Loved the ambiance and the vibe of people. It is loud, but not so loud that you have to yell to have a conversation. This place is a haven for whiskey lovers - the selection and variety is overwhelming!! On to the food - PHENOMENAL and SEXY. Loved the food. Firstly, they have a separate vegetarian menu :). That itself is worth a celebration. We ordered: Apps: Warm Cheese Gougere, Dunbarton Blue Mornay Sauce : Good, great start to the meal. Small Plates: English Pea Agnolotti, Roasted Trumpet Royal Mushrooms, Grana Padano, Black Truffle Vinaigrette and the Ricotta Gnudi (I dont remember the rest) - both the dishes were phenomenal. These were the highlight of the meal. Really amazing and absolutely refined. After seeing the place, tbh I was not expecting to get this kind of food. The portions were not that small for a small plate.  Entree: Slow Roasted Cauliflower, Beluga Lentils, Caramelized Onion, Golden Raisins, Mango, Cucumber Raita Cauliflower is one of my fav veggies, and I am glad that many restaurants have started to discover this veggie and making use of it. We loved this dish too. It was perfectly roasted cauliflower and the raisins and raita were a terrific touch. We were too full to try any dessert. I so badly want to go and try their salads, I am definitely going back here. The service was very friendly and on point.
