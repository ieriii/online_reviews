I want so badly to give this place 5 stars because the hot dogs are incredible. But at the end of the day, I just can't do it. I cannot give 5 stars to a business that hates work. That is just honesty. I really like Doug, but his work ethic makes me wanna jump out a window. They are never open, and when they are, they go at such a slow pace that the line is unacceptable long. I actually think he is doing it on purpose. Like when Playstation comes out and only releases a small amount of machines to generate buzz. No one can be that lazy. They are closed on Sundays and Mondays and they do not stay open after 4.
