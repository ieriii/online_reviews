Some of the previous reviewers need to relax. This is one of the best restaurants I've been to in Chicago. Great food (the cheese fondue and the dessert fondue were the best) and great ambiance. The entrees served with the premier dinner were good, but I've never been a fan of entrees at fondue restaurants. I'd recommend just getting the cheese and chocolate. Much better ambiance than melting pot and feels much less corporate. Very romantic!
