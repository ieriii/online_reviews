Items had: chips and salsa aztec bean to chocolate in a cup Ahodaga Barbacoa All items had were very yummy. The tomato broth with the Ahogada was nice and spicy... excellent carnitas. The chips kind of tasted a bit like fancy lovely Fritos with really really tasty salsas. The hot chocolate is rich and spicy and delicious. Everything was excellent and exactly what I expected. The prices don't really bother me... it is a) Rick Bayless' restaurant, and b) ingredients are almost entirely obtained from local farms using sustainable techniques. You just have to accept the line and the prices, realize where you are, and move on... you are not getting street food you are getting fancy street food. There's a difference. I can't wait to go back after 3 and try the soup... mmmmm.
