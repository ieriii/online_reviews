Great breakfast place!! I do not know about weekday morning but on weekends this place is really busy. a long line inside and outside of the restaurant. I went twice and we had to wait for like 40-50 mins both times. Their food is delicious and its portion is huge. HEY RICKY!! and MEDITERRANEAN OMELETTE were good. Side pancakes were good too (and BIG for side). I cannot wait to go back there:)
