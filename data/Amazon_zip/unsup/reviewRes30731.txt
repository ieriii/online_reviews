As a vegetarian, it can be challenging finding restaurants that have delicious vegetarian options. I have gone to The Chicago Diner on several occasions and must write a review about their divine and delectable delights. My carnivourous friend was excited about dining here yesterday for the first time. We dined on the country fried "steak", insanity 5 pepper chili, sesame kale salad and sweet potato fries.  Elliott, our server was the best. He was friendly, informative, patient and had good vibes. As usual, the food was scrumptious. My friend enjoyed her meal so much, she wanted to return the following day for breakfast. What makes the Chicago Diner wonderful is their delicious, no-frills cuisine. There are many restaurants that focus on their decor and marketing, but not the cuisine. This is hearty food for vegetarians, vegans and carnivores. Hence, their existence for almost 30 years. Created with tofu, seitan or tempeh, the food is so exquisitely prepared, one could easily fool a carnivore into believing they are actually eating meat.
