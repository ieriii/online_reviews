We went here for brunch on a Saturday and only waited about 30 minutes for a spot at the bar. I had an extremely hard time deciding what to order, because the everything looked and sounded delicious. I had the rock shrimp benedict and it was honestly one of the best meals of my life. My boyfriend didn't enjoy his chicken/spinach/eggs as much. Coffee and lattes are great and I would definitely go back.
