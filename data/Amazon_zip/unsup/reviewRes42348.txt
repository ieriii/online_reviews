This is not the same as it used to be. Ordered the seafood noodle bowl with soup. It cost $9.95. It came with one shrimp. ONE SHRIMP. That's all the "seafood" you are getting. When I asked the waiter, "Is that all?" and he replied that it is the manager's decision to cut the portions. Furthermore, he said it would cost a dollar more per shrimp.
