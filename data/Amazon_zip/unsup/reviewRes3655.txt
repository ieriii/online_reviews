The fact that I've remembered to review Crisp 8 months after my first visit is either a testament to my fantastic memory, or it's just good enough to imprint itself on my gray matter. I'm voting for the latter. The chicken was good and messy, just like BBQ should be. And the sides complemented the chicken well. I got my drink out of a refrigerated case, which, given the get-in-get-out-with-food setting, works just fine. It was clean, the service was fast and friendly, and the prices were good. The drawback Crisp suffers is the portions are way too massive for anyone to eat there regularly and NOT get fat. It's because the food is too damn delicious to stop. And there's so much of it. It's a vicious cycle, and the only way out is to EAT EVERYTHING!
