10 things I love about Irazu: 1. Aptly named Vegetarian Delights section on the menu. 2. Super welcoming and attentive staff. 3. BYOB. Red and White conveniently located next door. 4. Didn't bat an eye at us sitting there for 2 and a half hours. 5. Huge portions. One entree equals two meals. Unless you're me. 6. 'I Want To Know What Love Is' played. Multiple patrons swayed. 7. Ultra reasonable prices. 8. Oatmeal shake. Try it. 9. Oatmeal shake. You'll like it. 10. Oatmeal shake. I promise. 3 things to note about Irazu: 1. Hot peppers. Name doesn't lie. Rock them on the side and with caution. 2. Cash only. 3. No reservations. Expect a wait on the weekends. Bottomline, I like Irazu. A lot.  But I'm going to have to try a couple more menu options to see if it can earn that fifth star.
