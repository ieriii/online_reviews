This place used to be Ricebox. I used to love Ricebox. :( I finally got to try Crisp this weekend. I went for the Seoul Sassy. It reminded me of the Korean wings that I've had before. The sauce was really tasty. I thought it was a bit expensive though. It would be nice if the chicken came with some small sides. The whole chicken is definitely a better deal than the half though.
