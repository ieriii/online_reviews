What a disappointment! Great design, great location, decent service but horrible food. TO THE OWNER: Fire your chef. Just don't even think about it, fire him or her. Buddy, I'm a small business owner, too. You will not make it with the current chef, period.There's been only a few restaurants in my life - I am 38 by the way - that I really hated the food. This is one of them. Man, at least one dish (or even the salad) should taste at least average, right? Not at ZED451. Will go there only for drinks at the terrace. Would rather fast over night instead of eating an apple there.
