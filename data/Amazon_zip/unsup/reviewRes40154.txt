I just ate at this place today, and loved it. First, I stepped in and loved how they have the place set up, so it feels like you have your own private area for you and your friends. So, it's very ideal for a group setting or an intimate conversation. Everyone takes off their shoes in traditional Asian style as if you went into someone's home for dinner. You sit down where it looks like there's a table in the ground, but your feet hang down and there's a seat that you can lean up against on.  The menu is pretty big, and if you like OB beer they've got it! Beer and Korean BBQ is a great combination. After we ordered our food, the waitress brought tons of the tiny little appetizer plates that come with - there were at least 10 of them! I was so impressed. They even have potato salad that they make with their own Korean style. It's been claimed to be the best potato salad that a friend of mine has ever had. Another friend says that he brings his parents there and they all agree it's pretty authentic cuisine and they like coming to this place. I've been to a few other Korean BBQ restaurants, and you just can't beat the quality and quantity of food you get here. A lot of people like to go to the buffets, but you are better off getting what you pay for at a place like this.  I overate because the food was so good.  As in any Korean restaurant, you are going to walk away smelling like what you ate.
