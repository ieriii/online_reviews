This place definitely lives up to the hype!! We waited half an hr on a sunday morning for brunch. The wait wasn't too terrible. I would have went else where in wicker park, but i felt i needed to experience the food. In the past i been disappointed with hyped restaurants, but this place is definitely worth the wait. I had the blueberry pancakes with vanilla creme. it wasn't overly sweet and had the right balance of tart and sweet, delicious. From the savory menu, the vegetarian croissant sandwich was absolutely delicious. The egg was perfect and all the veggie pairing with the house mayo was sooo good. I would go back for seconds and thats coming from someone whose very meticulous about taste. The service could have been better. The server seemed a little unpleasant, maybe a bad day but the food made up for the wait and her mood.
