I had the steak Super Burrito that was filled with cheese, sour cream, lettuce, tomato, guacamole, onions, rice and beans. It reminded me of of a burrito you can get a Chipotle (which is not a good reminder to have), but it actually tasted much better. It had plenty of filling of the ingredients, and wrapped in a thin tortilla. With the hot salsa, it tasted even better. It was a considerable sized burrito, and it will leave you stuffed. I asked for no cilantro, and they honored that. It was cooked after ordering, and I appreciated that. I also ordered the horchata, and that was pretty good - had a hint of cinnamon and a delicious thick rice consistency. The food items itself were a little pricey, and I am not sure if it's worth hunting this place down. There are plenty of street parking off of Ashland, so that's not a problem. The place is clean, and is packed with locals and those who know about this place in the Chicagoland area. It has an authentic feel as well.
