This is a brunch review. I had a hard time giving this one a star value - I was happy with my meal but my partner was a bit unsatisfied with his sandwich. I'll get to that. Starting out: beignets = delicious. I only wish we had dipping sauce of some kind. Fruity, chocolatey, something. We ordered the cheddar biscuits and I loved every bite. I like biscuits and I love cheese, so the combination worked great for me. I got the bacon & swiss omelet sans scallions. I'm not an onion person. I loved the potatoes O'brien. And the omelet was definitely tasty. It was a little oogy though, like it maybe could have used one more minute on the stove. I also had the Italian Mimosa which was really more like less sharp champagne. I'm a lightweight and it made me tipsy, so it may be heavy on the alcohol. We had two people at the table love their meals: Eggs New Orleans and Benedict. So, those are recommended. The french toast was a bit herby for another diner. And the ham & cheese sandwich my partner had - the ham was cut up pieces and so he thought the distribution was uneven. He also said the sandwich was a "bit much". So there you have it. An A-OK meal. I'd be OK going back, especially since we didn't have to wait to sit.
