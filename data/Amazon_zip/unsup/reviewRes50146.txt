Raising the bar on bar food. I think this is what my friend called "fancy American." It's like catsup vs fancy ketchup. Typical burgers, fries and sandwiches but prepared really well. I mean, I feel kind of grown up and not like I just unwrapped my burger and peeling off the cheese that got stuck on the wrapper. My friends ordered burgers waffled cheese fries and a nacho to share- I opted for the grilled cheese and creamy tomato soup combo. The nachos were awesome. I think we licked that plate clean. My grilled cheese and creamy tomato soup hit the spot. On a cold windy night, it was just what I needed to be able to face the harsh weather outside. The service was good. I liked the attentive water guy. I do have to take off points for the dirty dirty restroom. Apparently when we were there, a drunk guy came in and peed all over women's restroom floor. I was contemplating doing the same to avoid the dirty stalls. Maybe next time, I will just pop a squat over the sink.
