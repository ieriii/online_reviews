My favorite Ethiopian joint in the city! A spot where I like to take friends and family from out of town to (and go to Green Mill afterward). Do not think about ordering your own dish, it's a place where you share food and eat from same plate... best way to eat in my opinion. Try tilapia dish, berbere beef and their awesome coffee :)
