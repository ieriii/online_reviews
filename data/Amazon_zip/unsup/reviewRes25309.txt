I LOVE this little cafe. It's kind of everything you could want in a Euro-cafe. Bakery with breads/cookies/cakes, take-out counter with gourmet sandwiches, pizzas and greek delights, wine shop, coffee bar & also a full-service restaurant. Their breakfast menu is short & sweet, but very very good. Their greek potatoes are amazing & served with almost everything from breakfast to lunch to dinner! In the Summer they open up the front windows that face the street for a great indoor/outdoor true cafe' feeling. LOVE THAT! Don't forget to take an order of fresh, hot lukoumades (greek donuts) with you when you go! Theirs are unbelievablely sweet, syrup-y and honey-y good!
