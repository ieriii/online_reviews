I came here with friends, so we ordered the Taste of Cuba appetizer plate, and to be honest, I could have done the whole thing again by myself and been happy. Everything was delicious, including the mojito, which tastes the way I always thought mint juleps should taste. Then I had the Cuban sandwich because I'd seen it made once, and was so intrigued by the mix of ham, roast pork, cheese and pickles that I knew I'd have to taste it some time in my life. I was not disappointed. It's absolutely wonderful, and when I go back there -- which I will -- it's going to be hard not to order it again. But I want to try the ropa vieja, the black beans with plantains, the tortilla cobb salad, baked goat cheese, and just about all the other appetizers. And more mojitos.
