What's a dickfour? Burn! Didn't that used to be a joke? Not really sure I nailed the punchline, but I'm going with four stars while being a dick. I've only been to Lockjaw twice, which is odd, considering I can walk there. I'm pretty good at walking see. Both times my burgers were good, but slightly undercooked. The first time was a turkey burger (I emerged salmonella free, w00t!). Last night was boeuf, which I ordered medium, but I think they only brought it up to 135 or so, so a couple bites were much rarer than I like them. I think the idea is that they play concert DVDs here, but last night, they had the main menu for a live Foo Fighters show flashing on all the TVs while playing completely different music. This was good, as watching and listening to a Foo Fighters concert would have made me cry into my burger. Instead, there was Edward Sharpe & The Magnetic Heros - Janglin, PB&J - Up Against The Wall, a couple other songs, and then I heard it... the offbeat unfriendly synths that can only be described as the musical incarnation of a frown: Rusko's classic remix of Kid Sister - Pro Nails. Very Chicago-oriented dubstep. Then they played Caspa's remix of Cockney Thug. Very Cockney-oriented dubstep. Then I went home and tried to watch the oscars, but it was too boring, so I flipped around. At some point I watched Walking Dead and felt a lot better about eating rare meat.
