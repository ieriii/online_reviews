We had heard about this place and decided to try it out. They have bar service but you can BYOB so I brought a couple of chilled bottles of Sav Blanc only to find that my friends seemed too burnt-out from the weekend to drink anything other that their nice strong tea, so I ordered a Kirin which came chilled in the Asian equivalent to a "40" which by-the-way pairs nicely with Duck.....and what a Duck!!!! Its not on the menu, but its their specialty. You call a couple hours in advance and reserve your Beijing (Peking) Duck, and they do it up right - full service with the buns, plum sauce, soup course AND the fried rice or noodle side. The duck was the best I've had. Crispy on the outside - tender and juicy on the inside. We ordered some egg rolls and pot stickers to start, both were fine but the Duck is soooooo fantastic you really forget about everything else. Highly, highly recommend this place!!!
