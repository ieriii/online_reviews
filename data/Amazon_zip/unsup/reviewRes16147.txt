This is a great choice for Italian dining on the north side of the city. Selection includes a variety of fresh pastas, buttery thick crust pizzas and other dishes. The best part of the service is the hot entrees come out piping hot- fresh off the stove/out of the oven and the salad is crisp cold. The prices are reasonable and worth the the generous portions.  Its a great place to go to any night of the week with a big appetite. Oh and there's a free parking lot for the restaurant, just across the street, if you cant find street parking.
