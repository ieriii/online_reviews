Came here for brunch this past weekend instead of waiting it out in front of M. Henry, and I'm glad we decided to stop in here instead. Awesome breakfast / brunch place with a southern feel. The food is a little pricier than usual and it's a subtle decor, which is conducive for breakfast but I'm not sure if it would really work for dinner. I had the Smothered Crawfish Omelet, it was very good. The only qualm I had with my dish was that all of the crawfish was concentrated in the middle of the omelet, but that's a minor issue. My girlfriend had the Eggs New Orleans, consisting of two crab cakes on top of two fresh biscuits. Both meals were very very good and I'm hoping to come back to this place for brunch again soon.
