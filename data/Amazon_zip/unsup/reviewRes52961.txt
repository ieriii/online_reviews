Casual, unique, fun - and de.lic.ious. I've had takeout from here once, and dined here once (in the winter/enclosed patio). Both experiences were great, reasonably priced large portions, and Mmm Mmm Goood. Delivery - came reasonably fast, and I was surprised by the amount of food. The chicken entree came with rice, a huge flattened chicken breast, lots of grilled onions, a few pieces of plantains, and a sep. container of black beans. That sounds like a lot of food. It was, and I ate it all, happily and quickly. Dining in - I really liked the vibe here. It was laid back and fun and something different. Waitstaff was quick and attentive, and again, the food was simple, quick and darn good. Ordered the same entree, and loved it just as much! We also got an appetizer of fried plantains in addition to what already comes with their entrees, because they are just that good.  This seems like the perfect spot for leisurely summer dinners in their back patio space, will def. be back when the warmer weather is here! It is BYOB, fyi...
