We went here for dinner tonight and brought our own Grey Goose. We knew it was BYOB but we didn't know that its either wine or beer. Lucky for us though our server said it was okay!!! *YEY!! How nice of them right?!!* On with the food! We ordered: Tiger Cry: really good! The (charbroiled) beef was so tasty and tender. The sauce that came with it has a kick to it. We loved it so much so we ordered another one =P Peanut Lover--- We ordered chicken with it. hmm.. I dont think that's the right name-but it has cashews in it. This entree is really good =) We ordered chicken with it. The only thing is their entree plate is so small!! lol (i guess I'm so used to big servings. ) Overall though- service is great, food is great! I have to try the other location according to Michael S. =P
