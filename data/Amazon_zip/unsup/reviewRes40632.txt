I've had about every combination of burrito and love them all. The only thing that sucks is if your burrito splits due to a bad wrap job or too much stuffing, you're pretty much screwed. Forget trying to eat it with the cheapo plastic forks and knives they provide. Salsa is also great - and HOT. Please don't come here if your idea of an excellent burrito comes from a chain owned by Jack in the Box or (until 2006) McDonald's (Qdoba/Chipotle) , you probably won't appreciate it.
