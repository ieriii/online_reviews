Service: 5; even though the place was packed, we were well taken care off Food: 5; Bone marrow spread was interesting and rich, BLT was super tasty with a fried egg on top, and the braised pork shoulder was melt in your mouth delicious. Drink: 5; Fantastic wines to choose from, though the bar can get crammed while you wait Location: Great if you are taking CTA... otherwise you need to valet I will be back next summer for sure.
