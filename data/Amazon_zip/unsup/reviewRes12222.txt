We came here on a Thursday night to use up the soon to be expired Groupon. Holy croquetas this place was hopping! We started with the Taste of Cuba appetizer. I really enjoyed the chicken and ham croquetas, especially dipped in the saffron sauce that comes with the order.  Cafe 28 has by far, one of my favorite chicken dishes in the city; pistacio crusted chicken. Now, when one thinks of Cuban food, pistacio crusted chicken is probably the last thing to come to mind. They do it very well here. The portion size is great for the price, the chicken is very tender and juicy, and I love the garlic white potato puree that is served with it. For drinks, I highly recommend their Mojitotini. It's like enjoying a mojito without the floating salad.  The service was friendly and efficient. Almost too efficient as we were in and out of there in about an hour.
