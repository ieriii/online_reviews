I have never been disappointed at the diner. As a vegan surrounded by mostly omnivores, I always had the problem of trying to find the one option for me at most restaurants (and it was rarely pleasant). I love that I can choose anything on the menu and be satisfied. There are also many gluten free options (beer included). There are so many things that I haven't had in probably about 10 years before coming to the diner. The MASHED POTATOES AND GRAVY are better than anything I have ever had as an omnivore. The "mac and cheese" is the most authentic I've tasted. Every entree I have had has been delicious, and leaves me full. At least once, get there before 3:30 for brunch. The desserts will make you cream your jeans. Try a milkshake- they beat any dairy one I have ever had. The lucky leprechaun shake fills in and then some for missing out on Shamrock Shakes. But better. You can taste the fresh ingredients in everything. Vegan cheesecake tastes authentic. I could go on and on! The staff here is wonderful as well. The food is always prepared promptly, and there is always enough staff. They are always friendly and enthusiastic, and will always give recommendations. Plus, you get a free dessert on your birthday! This restaurant alone has won my boyfriend over to the veggie side. No matter what you eat, go here. You will not be disappointed.
