Some friends recently enjoyed dinner here and recently invited us out so they could check out the brunch menu. It was mostly full but no wait on a Sunday at noon, and I couldn't decide if that was a good or bad sign. The menu had a good mix of egg-type breakfast dishes and sandwich-type lunch items to choose from depending on how late you slept in. I went for the most expensive item - the honey jalapeno pork chop (about $12). I was assured it wasn't too spicy - I like some kick, but don't understand people who enjoying sweating through their meal. Turned out I had nothing to fear. It was more sweet than spicy and the reason the place gets 4 stars. One large, thick chop, moist, with a side of scrambled eggs and potatoes that tasted really good in the sauce that had spilled over. The breakfast burrito looked great and my wife enjoyed her crab cake benedict. Casual and nice atmosphere, but minus one star for the service. Too much time between visits and drink refills, and leaving empty glasses when the refills did show up. Worth checking out.
