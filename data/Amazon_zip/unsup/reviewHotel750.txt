Like the previous reviewer, I too was here for a one day conference. I am giving it a 3 only because I did not stay in a room. It seemed like a nice hotel with a good location. We were on floor 16 in a conference room all day. It was a bright room, with decent views. The room had a lot of very nice things set up for us, including soda, coffee, and tee service, mints, pens, and paper. The chairs were comfortable, which is important for all day meetings like this. They also served lunch, which I thought was great. Caesar and caprese salad, sandwiches, and soup. The server was friendly, and they kept everything clean.
