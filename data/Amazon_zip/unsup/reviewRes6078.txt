It's hard for me to pick the number of stars as I really think this is a 31/2. Closer to four then three though. I preface this by saying I am not a huge meat eater...my date however was and I think he really enjoyed this venue.  I've been to wildfire twice. Once on the weekend and once during the week. It is a decent date spot but I would have enjoyed it more with a crowd. Seems like a good place to take my siblings for a holiday meal. It's not quiet and cozy and romantic. It is busy with a contemporary feel to it...great bar....decent food. I would suggest making reservations. We waited for over an hour the first time I went (no reservations) and were seated within 10 minutes of arriving with the reservations. We had crab cakes and shrimp stuffed mushrooms for appetizers. The crab was ok...not steller the mushrooms were ok as well. I had the beef short ribs and my date had the medialions with the different crusts...he seemed to enjoy it but I must admit that my short ribs were a bit fatty. All in all a good experience. Maybe not a romantic venue...but it would be a great place to go with friends who would like to share good drinks and eat hearty peices of meat. lol
