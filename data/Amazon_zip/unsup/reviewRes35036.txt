One of the best sushi places I've been to in Chicago. It's a small restaurant with contemporary decor. The waitress there was nice and responded kindly when we asked questions. There was a small party going on in the adjacent "area" that was partitioned with a fabric curtain, they were a little loud but it was a pretty large bday party and you could see they were drinking with all those liquor bottles they brought with them. Also, lots of customers get carry-out as well. We ordered the wasabi mashed potatoes that other yelpers recommended and they were pretty good, similar to regular mashed potatoes but with a hint of wasabi. We ordered a honey roll, a double stack mega roll, and the dragon fly roll. The honey roll was sweet and very tasty. The dragon fly roll had eel and mango in it, and that was REALLY tasty, the mango was really ripe. I'd strongly recommend those 2 rolls.
