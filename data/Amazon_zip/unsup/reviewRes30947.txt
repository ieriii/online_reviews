Big fan! Great cocktails, great food, and great people watching!! Our server was very attentive and recommended some rolls and dessert that were delish! I had the dragon roll, corn fritters, garlic noodles, and the ridiculous dessert. All acceptable! (Although the garlic butter noodles had a whole lotta garlic! I had to keep my distance the rest of the night). My friends all ordered meat dishes ( I was trying to be a good catholic during lent and not eat meat on Fridays) and they all loved their food. Enjoyed the ambiance, has a trendy chic vibe. It is really loud which wasn't a problem for our group and prices are a bit steep but it was well worth it. Can't wait to come back!!
