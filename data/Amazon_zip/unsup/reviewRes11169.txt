Thoroughly underwhelmed. I have been here four times, and I keep thinking that maybe of I order something different I will understand what all the fuss is about. Needless to say, I still don't understand what all the fuss is about. Don't get me wrong, the food is fine. However, it's not worth a 30 minute wait. Not hardly.
