I still love this place, though I don't live in Uptown anymore. The decor is way cool, the live jazz is generally good, and it's just a step above the rest in class. the crowd is usually pretty chill, I've never seen anyone get out of hand here. The only downside is that it's a little pricey for the neighborhood, but not downtown pricey. The history alone is worth 5 stars.
