Here is what we ate at 830PM on Thursday night. Please don't judge. Oyster sampler - 6 oysters Crab meal for two: lobster bisque soup clam chowder soup alaskan king crab dungeoness crab crab cakes creamed spinach au gratin potatoes cole slaw clarified butter key lime pie chocolate cake Yeah, we had to be rolled out on a cart afterwards. Our server was really accommodating, and let me substitute the soup and dessert so that we weren't both eating the same thing. I love variety. I also loved the cheese bread - it was yummy and soft.  Overall, a very solid restaurant. You know what you're going to get. We also had wine and coffee (intelligentia), and the bill with tip was right at $240.
