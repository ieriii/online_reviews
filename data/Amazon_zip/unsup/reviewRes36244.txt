Have only had the Thai here and it is awesome. Good crab rangoon, and if there's one thing I know it's good crab rangoon. The drunken noodle is quite good too. I live a few blocks away and have gotten carry out and eaten there, but most times I get take out it's nowhere near as good as eating there. Either way definitely recommended.
