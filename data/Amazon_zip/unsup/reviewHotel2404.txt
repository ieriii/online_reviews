First off, I reserved my room and accidentally reserved the room for 2 nights - Friday and Saturday. The bad thing was my flight came in Saturday so I called the hotel and explained they could give my room to someone else on Friday and I would just eat the cost and still stay Saturday. When my boyfriend and I arrive at the hotel the front desk told me that they cancelled my reservation because I didn't show up on Friday. I told them that I spoke with someone about the mixup and after about 15 minutes of standing at the desk the manager comes out. They said it was their fault and gave us a room. I was almost in tears from frustration but they finally set us up with a room so I was happy - for a little while. After exploring the hotel we went back to our room and tried to turn the heat up but it wasn't working so we had to call up maintenance to fix the heater. It probably took them an hour to figure out the problem and fix it. My boyfriend and I stepped out for 10 minutes to pick up some alcohol and when we came back the room smelled like burnt hair. Gross! It was getting late so we just decided to spray a bunch of my perfume to cover the smell. I was so stressed out that we decided to leave the Hilton and find another hotel. The overall look and feel of the hotel is great, but unfortunately my experience was not so 'hot'.
