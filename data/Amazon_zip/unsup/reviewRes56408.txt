I live in the neighborhood and have been a regular customer ever since Simply It opened...I've been there twice already this week! I'm addicted to the Lemongrass Chicken dish, but also love the Basil and Jalapeno Beef entree, so delicious. The Owner is always there and up front to greet you when you walk in, and the service is fantastic. The lunch special is an awesome deal - around $9 for soup, salad, egg roll, entree, and fruit (which is included after every meal there for free). I also love that it is BYOB. I cannot recommend this restaurant to enough people, you have to try it to understand how great it is!
