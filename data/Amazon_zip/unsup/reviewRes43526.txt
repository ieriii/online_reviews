Pros: Affordable and plenty of food. Not too many options on the menu, so not overwhelming. Easy to find street parking Orange Brioche French Toast + Huevos Rancheros---I Die. Don't have to wait for more than 30 mins for a table on the weekends... Cons: Line of people waiting makes everyone very aware that this is not the place to stew over your breakfast. Not good for groups.
