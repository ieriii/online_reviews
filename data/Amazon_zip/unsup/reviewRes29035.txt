I have always been a fan of Rick Bayless from his PBS shows and rooted for him on Top Chef Masters. I called on a Friday night for the following Tuesday lunch reservation at Frontera. They gave us an option of 11:30a or 1pm. When we arrived, there was not a wait and plenty of open tables. We started with Guacamole which came with two salsas and was good. We ordered Enchiladas de Mole Poblano, Enchiladas de Chivo and the Tuesday special with pork. The Enchiladas de Mole Poblano made with chicken was the best and very good. I'm not a black mole fan and really enjoyed this since it was not too sweet or smokey. Afterwards, we went to Xoco for churros and thick hot chocolate. For some reason the churros had a masa taste to them. Perhaps it's from the chips that are fried in the same oil or maybe it's one of the ingredients. Again, no wait.
