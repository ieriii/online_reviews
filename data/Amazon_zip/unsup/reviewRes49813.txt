Las Tablas I so wanted to love you. Maybe you were having an off night? Maybe I just needed to drink more? The Good: Atmosphere: Very cozy, could see this as a good date place. Drinks: Some of the best I've had in the area (maybe this is why all of the great reviews? The Not So Pretty: Food: Sum it up in 1 word. DRY. We tried both the empanada and dinner for 2 combination plates so we basically tried a good portion of the menu. They brought out some oil based sauces for the empanadas which made them a lot more tolerable but by the end of the meal my date and i decided maybe we were suppose to be putting it on everything. The Yucca, potato, fried plantains, bread, etc all were very dry and pretty much tasted the same (meaning like nothing). Except maybe the skirt steak which was ok (not the best i every had) even the meats were kind of blah. The chorizo was probably some of the mildest I've ever had. Service: Not sure where to start but it wasnt good. Walked in a on a weekend night to an almost empty restaurant. Wanted to sit outside, 3 empty tables but all needed some sort of clearing. Was told it would be ten minutes to clear the two glasses off. Huh? Ok waited and then was sat outside. 20 minutes goes by, no one stops by. The one waiter who was outside just kept looking over and then avoiding eye contact (not sure who else he was expecting to help us). After 25 minutes and watching the waiter stand around idle I go in for help. Waiter comes over asks if anyone has helped us to which we answer no. He says ok will be back in a minute and disappears for another 5 minutes before taking our drink order. This is how the whole night went. Unless I was in the mood just to drink and had plenty of time don't think I would be back.
