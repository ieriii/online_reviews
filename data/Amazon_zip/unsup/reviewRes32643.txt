Ever since I went there a few weeks ago, I have been craving to go back. The food was great. This was my first experience with Ethiopian food, and if you are a fan of either spicy or Indian food this is definitely a place to try! Injera which is a spongy, pancake like bread was amazing, it had a hint of lemon in it which definitely gave it a different flavor. The staff was friendly and helpful in answering any questions that our party had. The honey beer and the honey wine were also a must try if you are a fan of a sweeter drinks. One of the things that I really like about this place was that they had a pretty big vegetarian selection, I do eat meat but being that it is lent, at times I have to improvise. The prices are pretty reasonable also, and there was also a jazz type band playing light music throughout the dinner.
