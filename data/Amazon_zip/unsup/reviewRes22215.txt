Love this place. Speedy and friendly service, and able to accommodate large parties readily. I enjoyed every dish we ordered (I can't remember all of them, considering we were a party of 12 and my cousin had ordered everything before I sat down). Standout dishes include Boiled Beef In Spicy Szechuan Sauce, Sweet & Sour Chicken, and House Special Spicy Sole Fish Fillet.
