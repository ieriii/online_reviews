OK - I have gone back to Uncommon Ground a couple of times. They revamped the music room and added some doors to block sound from the restaurant and bar. So, now musicians can perform and their audience can actually hear the music! I still wish they would pay the musicians and charge a cover rather than pass a hat for tips though! The food continues to be good and unlike some other reviews, I have good service my last two visits! I also like that they are making an effort to buy ingredients from local sources and during the summer grow items on their own roof! So, I have changed my rating from one to three stars. Parking can be a challenge if the lot is full as the adjoining street is zoned parking.
