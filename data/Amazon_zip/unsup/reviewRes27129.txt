I have been to GE twice, once in early September with my husband, and once last night with a group of girls for a birthday dinner. I was happy with the experience in September, although I am ashamed of myself for spending $13 on an appetizer with Cheez-Its in it. My husband had short rib stroganoff and I had a salmon "BLT," both of which were very good. However, the experience last night was not good, at all. We waited nearly an hour past our 8:45 reservation. No one offered to take our coats or to get us drinks (the bar was full and there was nowhere to sit). When we were finally seated, it took FOREVER for the food to come out. We shared the potato bisque and the sweetbreads for a first course. The sweetbreads were great, but I agree with the prior review that said the potato soup tasted like it was from a can (I've actually had better from a can!) I tasted almost everyone's entrees, the monkfish was good, the skate wing was good. The beef tenderloin was so overly smoky I couldn't finish the small bite my friend shared with me.  For dessert, we shared the green apple fritters and the deconstructed Snickers bar. I've had better apple fritters at apple orchards and farmer's markets. The others LOVED the Snickers dessert, but I'm not much of a peanut fan, so I didn't much care for it.  Drinks and popcorn were fabulous - I highly recommend the Indian Summer. Yum! Beyond the strange service and how long it took for the food to come out, I had a major issue with the bathrooms. THEY ARE DISGUSTING. GE is not a bar, therefore, when I am spending upwards of $80 on dinner, I fully expect not to have to "hover."  The garbage was overflowing, there were no paper towels or toilet paper, and there was pee all over the place. Sick. I probably won't be back - I've been there twice, it's pretty good but not outstanding, it's pricey, and there isn't the attention to detail that I expect from an upscale place.
