This place is such a gem! Cozy and romantic, the food is divine, the atmosphere is perfect for a date or even anniversary. The cheese fondue will blow your effin mind! You get a lot of food and you have to force yourself to eat dessert which is an absolute must! Chocolate fondue to dip your strawberries, pound cake, grapes. So ummy yummy good! I can't wait to go back as I have a $20 off certificate to use! It can get a little pricey... :-)
