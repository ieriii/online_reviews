It took me forever to try this place, because I for sure thought it was a quick serve outpost of Fogo de Chao. But thanks to some Yelping, I realized it's a pizza place! And despite the bad name, the pizza is quite good. It's Brazillian pizza, which is basically just American pizza with cool toppings. We ordered delivery and got the BBQ Chicken. The chicken was very good, high quality. The only weird part was the HUGE slices slices of Gouda. I thought they were overwhelming and had to pull a few off, but the bf loved them, so personal preference. The crust is very good. I will order from them again for sure, they have lots to choose from on the menu.
