Clearly 680 reviews aren't enough for this place, so here's my input: I am thoroughly convinced that this is the best breakfast in the country. I can't imagine it getting any better than this. The standard fare (omelettes, breakfast burritos, etc.) are phenominally tasty, using fresh & properly seasononed meats & veggies. However, what really stole the show for me were the more dessert-like breakfasts. Chocolate stuffed french toast - Oh my. This was ridiculously good. The flavor was so rich and the presentation so, well presented? I took a picture of it and e-mailed it to all of my friends back west to make them jealous. I spent six days in Chicago, a land of many awesome restaurants, and had to go back a second time by myself: It was that good. I had white chocolate and caramel covered pretzel pancakes. WTF? This guy is the made scientist equivalent of the culinary arts. On top of all that, it's reasonably priced and the staff is extremely friendly. It is worth the wait. Always wait. Never don't wait. There are shops all around this place and a neat coffee place if you can't wait that long before you get your fix.
