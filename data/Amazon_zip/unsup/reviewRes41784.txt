One of my go-to neighborhood spots. Food is always outstanding. Perfect for a date or group. Definitely recommend ordering as much as your paycheck and stomach will allow as dishes are ideal for sharing. Beside the food, the ambiance and vibe is excellent. If you're going on a weekend, check with the downstairs lounge - Curio - and put your name on the list for a table. Enjoying a cocktail there is the perfect way to end your meal.
