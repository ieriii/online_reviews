Three stars, docked for shitty service from Wesley and team. With 160+ reviews that are all around four stars, you should definitely visit Carnivale. Yes you should get the raspberry mojito, Yes you should get the ceviche. No you should not go at 10:00 on Wednesday. Each staff member will re-inforce the time that they plan to go home, and how they're going to do everything quicker to move you along. Which includes taking plates from your table and then asking, "Are you finished." This is also not limited to brushing crumbs into your lap in efforts to wipe the table clean and not limited to grouping 10 feet from your table and watching you eat. I'm not going to go back, just because I can find other places in the city that are just as disrespectful with a tab cheaper than $180 for six.
