This restaurant gives you what you deserve when you expect high class. From the moment I called to see if we needed a reservation until we left with full tummies I felt like the people here actually enjoyed working there and were happy to serve us. We did not have reservations and there were no seats at the bar so we were led to a standing table to enjoy wine and starters, if we ordered them. Almost finished with our wine we had decided to leave when a hostess informed us that we could be seated at a communal table. Yay! We took it. The seating was not as strange as it sounds. I expect to see more of this as our city becomes more and more crowded. If you call and reserve you could be seated in a really cool booth that is designed to make you feel like livestock in a pen. The plates are shared, we had the Bollito misto (sausage, smoked ham and pork shoulder) and Cauliflower gratin. You know the food is good when Dora and I are a table and we're both quiet. We kept looking at each other and saying, "oh my God!" Our server, who looked a bit like Xhibit, helped us decide on the sticky toffee pudding. More moments of us staring at each other and muttering only, "oh my God!" Before leaving I had to check out the bathrooms. They are caruoseled around a circular trough style sink supplied with soap and lotion. It was at this lovely sink that I experienced my only negative moment...and not at the fault of the restaurant. I watched two men leave their bathrooms and PASS BY THE SINK without washing their hands!!! Dudes!! I see you! EWWWWWW!!!! I guess you do not have to be classy to be served like you are.
