I love the ambience of this place. The dramatic velvet curtains, the soft candle-light, the slight hum of chatter...it's all so fantastic. It's a bar you can go to and actually talk to your friends. I love to sit at the bar and pick the bartender's brain. They always love to show off their creativity by concocting off-the-menu cocktails for you. Every custom drink they have ever made me was always better than anything I would have picked of the menu. If you haven't tried their food, it just happens to be quite amazing as well. Well worth the wait and by far one of my favorites in the city.
