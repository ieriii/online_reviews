While I wouldn't say this was the most amazing breakfast I have ever had. It was certainly solid choice. One of my favorite aspects was that they have a deal with the bar down the street to allow people to wait inside and enjoy coffee and morning cocktails until their table is ready. So much better than having to stand in a lump at the doorway and get pushed around by new people trying to get on the list. The juice bar was also delicious and took it up a notch putting a bit of flair on the drinks we ordered. The food was okay. My husband had the Cristo Melt, which he thought was very solid though maybe a touch more cheese was needed but the bread was fabulous. My friend an asparagus omelet which came red potatoes. The potatoes were good, especially if you aren't looked for the char that many restaurants have. I tried the Portabella Crepes. The mushrooms had great flavor, but the crepe seemed like it had too much egg in the batter as I sometimes felt like I was eating a really thin omelet. But it definitely tasted yummy. The other great thing was the people watching. This was our first time and maybe it was a fluke, but both parties seated next to us during our brunch were quite entertaining to eavesdrop on. The last thing I will say is that many of the reviews are right that the tables are a bit close together. I don't think I would hit this spot with a stroller or wheelchair in tow -- or at least not during the busy times.
