Why did I like Garcia's so much? Namely, because I didn't expect to like it at all. "It's so loud!" I bleated. Repeatedly. And loud it was - newly-remodeled, there's no real separation between the "bar" part (with TVs blazing) and the "restaurant" part. This crabbiness dissipated as soon as the salsa arrived on our table. This stuff was good! So fresh! So tasty! I shoveled it down like with no shame. Seriously. There were salsa splatters all over my side of the table. Boyfriend - aware of my fondness for avocados - suggested I get the avocado burrito. Done! He got the two taco dinner. However, we were both kind of curious about the fish taco, so we got one to share.  Our meals were quite large. I was able to cut my burrito in half and take part home for lunch the following day. For only $5, that is quite a deal! Boyfriend's meal was similarly proportioned.  The food was delicious. Everything was so fresh - from the avocado in my burrito to the tomatoes on the fish taco. I enjoyed every bite I was able to take. mmmmm, and what's that? Not seeming so loud anymore. Apparently good food trumps my auditory senses. The only real negative? Service was slooooooooooow. (Now, in case you're thinking I lack a basic grasp of phonetics, rest assured - those extra o's are there to show my general annoyance at the speed of said service). I wasn't in a rush, but a refill on my Diet Coke would be kinda nice, ya know?
