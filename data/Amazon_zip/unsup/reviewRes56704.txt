The outdoor patio is lovely and the service was relatively attentive, if a bit slow. As Sapori has so many glowing reviews on here, and is often very busy, I was surprised at how disappointed I was by the food. The homemade pasta in the seafood spaghetti tasted and looked like Ramen noodles. It was about 5 minutes past al-dente, which is simply unacceptable for a $22 plate of pasta. Then there was the sauce: appalling! Tasted exactly like Chef Boyardee; if it wasn't from a can it sure tasted like it was. The seafood was ok, but overcooked as much as the pasta was.My date had lasagna--same nasty sauce, but had beef in it, so tasted like the beef version of Chef Boyardee. Also $20.Ladies and gentlemen, I ask you: what's with all the glowing reviews? This place stinks for the price point. Many other Italian places in LP--that was the first and last time I will eat at Sapori Trattoria.. Oh, the bread was good (that's what the stars are for).
