This is probably one of the best Chinese restaurants in the city. There is usually a wait, but never long enough that I've been tempted to go somewhere else. I've been here several times and always try something new. My favorites: Hot & Sour Rice Noodle Soup, Chinese Eggplant in Garlic Sauce, Stir-Fried Chinese Okra. The food is cheap, especially in terms of how much you get. I've never not been satisfied when coming here.
