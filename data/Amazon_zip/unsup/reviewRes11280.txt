Red velvet pancakes - yummmmm! Apple tarte tatin pancakes - yummmmm! Only complaint was that the restaurant was pretty empty and we were still seated by the front door and had to experience the draft every time someone walked in or out. Portions are humongous - i devoured my meal over the course of the day ....
