We choose this hotel based on price/location. Now with that the hotel is smaller and not as glamorous as other Chicago hotels but better then other Best Westerns I have been too. The rooms are small which is perfectly fine if all you are doing is sleeping and relaxing in between all the wonderful activities Chicago has to offer. The bed was comfortable and I felt like most of the room was updated nicely. The location is the best you are right across from Grant Park, down the street from the Aquarium, and the Art Museum. For people that do not want to walk down to where all the shopping is on the Magnificent Mile then this is not your hotel. It was a decent walk but it was perfectly fine for my husband and me. Parking is valet but we did not use our car once we were in Chicago we simply walked or took pubic transit.
