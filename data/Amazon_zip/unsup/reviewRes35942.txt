This use to be the place we constantly dropped by if we wanted our fix of barbeque pork and other goodies. In fact , 15+ years. Not anymore. The quality of the carry out barbeque foods has dropped, for some unknow reason. Wonder if the dad/owner is aware of this. They better fix the problem, otherwise they'll continue to lose customers like myself and other people I know.
