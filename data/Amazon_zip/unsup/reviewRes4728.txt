One of my favorite places in the city! Love the cozy atmosphere. It's a great place to go with a couple friends and catch up. They have an amazing Sauvigon Blanc wine, great monthly cheese selection, and I am obsessed with the beet and goat cheese appetizer. I'd love to try everything on their menu, but the few things I've tried have been so good that I can't seem to order anything else! I know..so boring..but why mess with perfection?!  Definitely check this place out, highly recommended!
