I ate at PS for a client dinner. It was a group of 8 and overall the feedback was quite good. Everyone enjoyed their food. The grilled calamari app was delish - light and smoky. My meal, the SPAGHETTI NERI "FRUTTI DI MARE" (String cut black spaghetti, mussels, clams, shrimp, calamari, San Marzano tomatoes, red pepper flakes) was the recommendation from the waiter based on the couple of dishes I had narrowed it down to. It was fabulous and I wish I had leftovers to go home to today! Service was friendly and knowledgeable, but a bit slow. I would have liked to have seen wine, apps and meals all ordered at once, but after ordering he did stop by regularly to check in on the table.  The ambiance is classy and warm. Literally warm - the guys were complaining of being too warm temperature wise. The decor is elegant and there are beautiful glass chandeliers over the bar that you see as you enter the restaurant. The acoustics were well planned and the ceiling has attractive suspended wood panels that absorb sound in the cavernous space and enable easy dinner conversation. Oh, and $6 valet parking. Great experience and I HAVE to return in the summer to check out the enormous and beautifully landscaped patio that they have out back.
