I'm sure I could say a million things that have already been said, but I won't. My boyfriend and I are here every Saturday (no, we don't weigh 5,000 pounds collectively), and Doug knows the boyfriend by name. The specials are always killer (I do the chicken sausages) and the fries are to die for. But I have two things to say to all future visitors of Doug's: 1) This place is NOT good for groups. The biggest tables sit six people, max. Not to mention that groups larger than this eat up the space. If you can split yourselves up, more power to you. Otherwise, don't bring your entire extended family from the suburbs. 2) This place is NOT good for people with strollers. Strap that baby holder on and leave the stroller in the car. There was a couple with TWO strollers (for three kids) in line today. When they got to the door they finally said out loud, "Maybe we shouldn't take the strollers inside." Really? No kidding? Hot Doug's is a SMALL, small little joint. There's roughly 10 tables. No strollers, darn't! The lines are always unbelievably long, and there isn't any space for your strollers! Oh, and my final gripe to visitors of Doug's (and especially the suburbanites who see Doug's as a tourist attraction)? When you're done, LEAVE. GET UP AND LEAVE. Don't dawdle. Don't read the sports page. Don't examine the meaning of life or consider all the silly jokes you could stay to the people waiting in line ("Sorry guys! They're out of sausages! -- which someone says every, flippin', week ...). JUST GET UP, CLEAR YOUR TABLE, AND LEAVE. LEAVE! Why? Because on any given day, the flow of people is constant. Especially on Saturdays. And that, folks, is a quick tidbit of Hot Doug's advice. The food? Well, it speaks for itself. And Doug? He does the same. Respect the man. Respect the restaurant. Respect the signs he posts. Respect the space. Or go home!
