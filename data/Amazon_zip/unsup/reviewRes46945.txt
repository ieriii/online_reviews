A delectable little morsel of a restaurant. The coffee was organic and lovely and sweet and dark. My cave-aged cheddar, caramelized onion, spinach and broccoli omelette was unreal. All complex and sharp and bright without being too much. The breakfast potatoes were patatas bravas-esque, i.e. perfect. Sort of wish there had been splenda for the coffee. Otherwise, perfection.
