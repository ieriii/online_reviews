I normally just come here for happy hours.I find the staff to be very nice and cordial. The servers have a personality...something you don't really see elsewhere.I like their outdoor patio as well, though it can loud from the train. Food is just fine. Not the best I've ever had, but that's not a concern. Overall, I really dig this place!
