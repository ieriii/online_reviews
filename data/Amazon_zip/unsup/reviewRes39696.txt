I love this place. The menu has such great choices and many unique items and combinations. My wife and I went there for brunch. After much hand-wringing and agonizing over what to order. I ordered the wild boar sloppy joe. It was sublime. It was also very rich and filling. My wife ordered the fried chicken and waffles with come with a pork belly hash. She loved the waffle, thought the chicken was good and liked the hash. We both had Bloody Mary's and they were absolutely wonderful. Nice and spicy and garnished with a tiny pickle and a block of sharp cheese. There are so many interesting items on the menu I have got to go back and soon. In addition, the service was fantastic.
