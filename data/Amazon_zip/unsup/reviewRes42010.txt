Great place for a late night dinner and to feel like you had a night out when you only had a couple of cocktails and a wonderful meal. The ambiance is really nice, it dark but still warm. We started with the blue cheese fondue, caramelized onions & spinach and it was super tasty (albeit a little salty). The beat salad was amazing and it complimented the toasts very well. Each of us tried a different pasta and the best of them was definitely the truffle pasta with hand cut noodles. The brussel sprouts were also really well prepared. I thought the orecchiette with spicy pork sausage & the bolognese with pappardelle were okay. It didn't matter at that point though because we were pretty full from our appetizers. The cocktails were delicious! We had Pimm's Cups, Dark & Stormies, and several others. Pick one, any one. They were great. All in all - a great night out!
