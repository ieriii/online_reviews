This review is specifically for the fifth floor banquet hall.. If you know you will be attending a meeting or symposium here, I highly suggest you swing by Starbucks beforehand to get your favorite drink in a Venti cup and a big yummy pastry to get you through the morning, because I'm sorry, Marriott - dry apple strudels and a choice between house blend or decaf is not my idea of a quality breakfast. When you're competing with places like the Union League Club, which serves three-course meals to its conference attendees, that's just embarrassing. Also, bring a sweater - the banquet hall is cold!
