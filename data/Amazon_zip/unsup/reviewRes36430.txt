My GF and I are always looking for good Thai and this place has it. Close to the house and some of the best Crab Rangoon in the city. The other night I had the Indie Curry with beef. The beef was spectacular. Perfectly cooked. I was able to cut it with my fork/chopsticks. Highly recommended.  It can be a little pricey if you decide to make it a sushi night. The sushi is pretty good, but I've had better at a more reasonable price. If you make a thai night then it is a very affordable meal. Plus it's BYOB which is always nice. If you live in the neighborhood and you haven't tried Indie yet then you're missing out. Make the trip. It's worth it.
