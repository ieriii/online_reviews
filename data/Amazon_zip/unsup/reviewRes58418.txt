We love this place! So let me breakdown the main course part of the menu... there are two sections De Cuba and Estilo Nuevo. I'm not gonna pretend to know what they mean (though I'm venturing something from Cuba and something new...hehe). The impression we got was the De Cuba list offered more authentic, home-cooked type dishes. If you're in the mood for something a bit upscale and unique, order from Estilo Nuevo...and you won't be disappointed.The Honey Jalapeno pork chops are fantastic and generous portions would be an understatement. They give you two HUGE pork chops where one of them would be enough (leftovers!!).The Blackened Duck is probably my favorite dish. Though, not quite as large as the pork chops, it is simply delicious. Tenderly cooked meat packed with tons of flavor.They have some fish dishes as well, but we've only ever ordered the Almond Crusted Halibut.As others have said, the mojito's are great. The only time we had something we didn't like was when they had a ceviche as an appetizer special. It was only ok, but I can't say I'm a ceviche expert...so don't let me stop you.Great restaurant, great service, and great food!
