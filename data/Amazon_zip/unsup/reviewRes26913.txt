Pequod's is simply undeserving of the 4-star average rating. I have eaten here maybe 10 times in 15 years. Just recently I ordered a large sausage deep dish. This thing took an hour and a half to be delivered two blocks north and 5 blocks east. Once it arrived it was more expensive than I thought- they didn't give me a total, just an oversight, but had I known I would have ordered baccino's or amato's- anything. The pie arrives. We open the box. Eyes open wide, mouths salivate, and we each take a slice. After one bite- Garbo. Simply shitty pizza. Now this is the deep dish that I'm talking about. And this is Chicago mind you. You can get away with this kind of schwag in Colorado, but not in the land of pizza and hot dogs. No No No. This thing is 95% bread. Little Sauce and even less cheese. The sausage itself was fine. The "crust", as people call it, is a gimick- silly chewy not chrunchy, greasy and it was an effin miracle I even made it that far. Verdict: slow. pricey. gross. and yes Doug S., two stars is being too nice.
