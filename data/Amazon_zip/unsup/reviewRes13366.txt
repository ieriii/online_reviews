I'm the 800th reviewer for this place so I'm definitely late to the party, but I will have to chime in with everyone else and applaud Revolution for its beer, food, and ambiance. Things I loved about Revolution: --the music --the cozy, casual library-like atmosphere upstairs --the bacon fat popcorn --fish and chips --the AWESOME beer selection (I had an oatmeal stout and a Delirium Tremens) --the good service Things that were just alright: --the buffalo wings --the cauliflower soup --autumn harvest pizza (kind of soggy) I'm glad we went on a weird weekend (Halloween) when there was no wait, we were seated upstairs right away. Our waitress was dressed up as a bumble bee (I had to try really hard to take her seriously--but appreciated the attentive service she gave us). The downstairs and upstairs seem like two different restaurants--two different looks, but same warm feel. Now this is a revolution I can support.
