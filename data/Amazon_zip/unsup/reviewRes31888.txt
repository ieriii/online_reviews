A great find! I came here looking for ambiance to celebrate a birthday dinner and loved the look and feel of the place. My husband and I chose a selection of small plates to share rather than a main entree. The pan fried rice with spicy tuna was really good as was the crab cake crusted tuna (would definitely order again)! Thought our specialty sushi roll tasted fine but wish it wasn't cut so big as it made it a little hard to eat all in one bite. The place was loud which I didn't mind but there was a lot of shouting going on to hear each other and the waitress. The drinks were a little off....I've never seen a foamy manhattan before. Overall had a good time and enjoyed the food. A plus that it's right off the Grand red line stop so you don't have to worry about driving or grabbing a taxi.
