Just celebrated our 5 year anniversary here on Friday. Amazing combinations without relying on all the fancy tricks of molecular gastronomy. We've been to Alinea, Moto, WD-50, and Tru and Bonsoiree fits right in. Opened my eyes up to some new flavor combinations and introduced me to the strangest mouth feel I've ever had -- I believe it was the sancho blossom from the szechuan pepper plant. Well done. We will be back!
