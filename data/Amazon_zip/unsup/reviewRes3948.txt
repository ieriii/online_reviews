I recently tried out Crisp and found it to be pretty good. The Seoul sassy is essentially kkang poong gi, though could use a little more spice to it. It was good though. The buffalo sauce is decent, though I prefer not having specks of chili in my sauce. The BBQ wasn't that great. I would stick with either the sassy or the buffalo myself The bibim bap was solid though not much different from any other bibim bap I have had (and not as good as mom's ;) ). Perhaps the biggest draw back is the limited eating space. They only have 3 tables and you just have to wait for one to free up....so it's much more convenient to get delivery or take out.
