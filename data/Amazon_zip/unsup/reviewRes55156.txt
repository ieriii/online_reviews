I can't believe how good this food was! I am not a huge fan of BBQ but this place was very good. All the food we had was fantastic. The hush puppies are to die for. We had the competition ribs and they were out of this world! Homemade key lime pie OMG!Chicago is full of BBQ joints but this stands above all the rest. It's so hard to find a BBQ place that doesn't just slather their meat with tons of sauce. Here all the BBQ is dry rubbed with the sauce on the side. You can actually taste the superb quality of the meat and you don't even need the sauce. My date on the other hand did add sauce, but it was very little.The service was great. Not too pushy and gave us time to enjoy the food and convo and our cocktails were always full. Our waiter Brian was so helpful and knowlegeble about the menu. You could see that he enjoys his job. He was attentive but didn't hover. He was friendly, fast and gave excellent service through the whole meal. I was interested in the idea of upscale BBQ was new to me but now a huge fan and can't wait to come back!
