It's so cozy in here, but in a very classy way! Seriously, where else can you go drink a beer in an old-fashioned, dignified looking library??? The prices are a bit on the higher end relative to other places nearby, but it's also much nicer on the inside, so I don't mind. Their food is *really* good!
