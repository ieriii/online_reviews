I went here on Halloween after reading many reviews and only waited about 15 minutes. There were five of us and we ordered five different tortas. i had the suckling pig and it was like a pulled pork. Not bad but not great. I was expecting crispy skin, chunks of pork, lots of juice. My fault for expecting the hype and genius of Rick Bayless to match. i love his other places and his food. The best I tasted was the chicken milanesa. But it's hard to mess up a grilled sandwich/ paninni. The churros were good but I've had them in Spain with the chocolate on the street and not impressed.  I'll be back for the soup. Reasonably priced.
