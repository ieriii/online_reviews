Really good and SUPER CHEAP eat in Wicker Park. Some friends of ours who are vegetarians go regularly and introduced it to us. I've tried their hummus (yum), baba ganoush (decent), and falafel sandwich (super). All of it was unbelievably CHEAP! I got so full I couldn't even finish my tasty falafel sandwich. If you're looking for a good, quick, and CHEAP eat in Wicker Park (perhaps before spending a little more cash on cocktails elsewhere :) check out Sultan's Market. Oh and did I mention it was CHEAP!
