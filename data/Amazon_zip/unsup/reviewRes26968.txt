THE PEACH DESERT. OMG THE PEACH DESERT. This is the sort of thing I dream of. It was beautiful. heavenly. The sort of thing where you have to close your eyes and moan a little after each bite. and the pork belly. and the watermelon amuse-bouche. and the soup wasn't bad either. everything else was kinda meh...the strawberry basil desert was interesting, but the rest of the deserts were a let down after the peach.  I would give more stars if our server didn't suck...for a place that costs this much, I expect the servers to be on top of things. he... -forgot to bring us menus and then tried to take our order -said we had two more deserts left to go and asked if we wanted any coffee...in the middle of our meal. I don't think we were even half way through yet. -brought us the wrong check. The first check he gave us was for $55...it was just the drinks. We thought maybe they do it weird and you pay the bar tab separate or that we were gonna get lucky and get a free meal...but nope. He just messed up. Oh, and he spilled the drink of the couple sitting next to us. They got up and left shortly after that.
