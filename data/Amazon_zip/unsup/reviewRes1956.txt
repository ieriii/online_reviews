If you like sausage and you haven't been to Hot Doug's yet, what the heck are you waiting for? True the lines could be long, and sure the prices for a bit steep for the specialty sausages. But I think they have a name for a Hot Doug's with no line and cheap prices, which is Heaven. At that point, you may want to check if you're still alive... There's not much I can say that hasn't already been said. Oh, I know. Celery Soda. Yes, indeed! I figured that while I was being somewhat adventurous with my meats, I might as well try a beverage out of the cold case made out of my vegetable enemy (or "vegenemy" if you will). It was surprisingly good! It reminded me of ginger ale, but you get that distinctive taste of celery instead of that gingery spiciness that comes with a quality ginger ale. God bless you, Mr. Doug, for the work that you do!
