Wow, I think this is the best vegan restaurant I have been to - it's nice to be able to eat everything on a menu during brunch/lunch time! I was visiting town and the place we all attempted to go to on Sunday afternoon was closed (sad face) but I did massive research at 8am and found this place online. O.M.G. It's a little out of the way if you are staying in the main part of Chicago. However, a cab ride is worth the sacrifice to savor this delicious veggie/vegan/BYOB goodness. The atmosphere does look like a diner, and there are hot sauce options (can we add a 6th bonus star somehow?). We ordered a couple things: SPECIAL RECIPE "WINGS" - tasty! but... NACHOS -Seitan chorizo, spiced black beans, tomato, onion, jalapeos, guacamole, sour cream, cheeze & salsa.  As you can see, we liked the nachos a lot more Seitan Gyro - BEST THING EVER. The flavors were oozing Greekness, the moistness was perfect - and the quantity was overflowing. Yum. Even one of my friends who eats meat was in love with this and was tempted to go vegetarian if things tasted this amazing. The sweet potato fries that came with it were quite yummy as well. THE SOUL BOWL - Seasoned quinoa, spicy grilled tofu with chimichurri sauce, flashed greens, mashed sweet potatoes & fat free black beans (added avocado) We left some of this behind, it sounded good on the menu but it was kind of dry and flavorless. But, uber healthy so we ate a good amount of it.  Chocolate Cake - YUM YUM Carrot Cake - My favorite of the two desserts. It was so nice to be able to order dessert at a restaurant :)
