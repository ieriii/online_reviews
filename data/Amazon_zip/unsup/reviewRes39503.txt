Um totally delicious, all the times. This place can get a little busy and sometimes the wait is long, but I don't think it's been over hyped like some other restaurants. Everything here is A++, every dish I've had, or I've tasted as been in short, amazing. The patio sitting outside is really nice, and the new little bar in the back also outside is a great too since the wait can be a little while. I've been 3 times and had a range of stuff off the menu, which I'm pretty sure changes from time to time. And the drink menu is also a delight, don't hesitate to ask the waiters and bartenders what to get, they know what's delicious. Definitely a impressive place to take someone.
