Graham Elliot was a decent restaurant that left something to be desired. Some dishes were delicious, others were odd and unsatisfying. It really varied greatly based on the dish. Our waiter was very nice, but not entirely helpful - I asked him to make a recommendation and he responded that everything is good and I couldn't go wrong. Uh, thanks? Their beef tartare - served italian beef style - was the best dish of the night. It was very flavorful and all the tastes fit well together. The scallops were also cooked very well. Tonight was the last night of the fall/winter menu, so whoever goes after this will get to experience a new menu. The London Calling pimm's cocktail with cucumber soda was tasty. Presentation is impressive, but in the end falls short of amazing. We probably won't be back...
