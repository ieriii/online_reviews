This is the best place ever! So mad that I didn't think of it first! There is a better Chicago Style hot dog in Portage Indiana at Depot Dog, but the encased meats here, my god! true frittes fried in duck fat!?!? Brilliant!! (Fri and Sat only) If you live in chicago and have not been here yet, please back up and move out of the city, you don't deserve Chicago!
