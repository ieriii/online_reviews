"No self respectin' Southerner uses instant grits."  - Mr. Tipton, "My Cousin Vinny." And I'm guessing it's a safe bet they aren't used at Big Jones. Their cheddar cheesy grits were downright tasty. They were even better slathered over the buttery biscuit that came with them.  Seriously, I just want to slather myself with those grits. I went a bit savory overboard and ordered the Eggs New Orleans with a side of potatoes O'Brien. This rich dish consisted of two poached eggs, nestled on top of crabcakes, which were comfortably placed in popovers, and adequately covered in bearnaise sauce. How god how I love bearnaise sauce.  The potatoes O'Brien were about as perfect as potatoes O'Brien can be. Thinly shaved potatoes that weren't too greasy. They had the right amount of crunch to them. There was also little bits of onion and what I can assume green bell pepper. I want more. Now. The coffee is served in an over-sized mug for only $2.50, with free refills. Our server asked if I wanted cream and sugar. She arrived with a little pitcher of cream and a tall bottle with a spout. At first I thought, "Why did she bring me olive oil?" I soon realized it was simple syrup which I was to add to my coffee instead of granulated sugar. Ok, I'll play along.  I really adore the decor of this place. It's classy Southern and while being here, I felt like I should be bit more proper than normal, and speak with a Southern accent.
