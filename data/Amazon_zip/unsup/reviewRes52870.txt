This place is all about the atmosphere. The decor is ethnic, the lighting is to perfection and the Cuban music is the icing on the cake. Having said that, we were too distracted to enjoy our surroundings. My husband and I made reservations for a Saturday evening. As we entered the venue, I thought it was going to be a tiny little place, but to my surprise this place is quite spacious. We were escorted to the back room where the liveliness occurs. I was impressed immediately. I even whispered to my husband that I would love to come back for my birthday. NOW, we were unfortunately sat right by the door all the way in the back. We didn't think this was going to be too bad, but it was a cold night. I believe there is a waiting room nearby and large groups and servers kept going in and out and we were freezing. It was quite annoying having people constantly walk by our table. We did ask if we could be moved -- even one of the servers said "yea, it sucks being by the door".. but because it was a busy night they could not accommodate our request. The manager, however, did tell us that our appetizers would be on the house. (That didn't happen-- don't make promises you can't keep!). The food was ok, I've had other Cuban food that has knocked me out of my chair, but this food wouldn't necessarily be the most memorable.  The service was great, we had a very attentive waitress. Overall, I would come back and perhaps our experience will be better if we sit elsewhere. This is definitely a cute spot for a date or for a large group. I can see myself coming back with a large group and a few bottles of wine.
