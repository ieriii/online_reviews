This is an incredibly mediocre restaurant.  The food is okay, but there's nothing new here and it's all a bit too greasy and plain. The pita isn't stale, but it's not fresh. The seating area is filthy, but the cook stations were clean enough. It's cheap, but it's cash only. If you really crave middle-eastern McDonalds, I guess this is your place. Don't expect anything from the employees but the sullen gaze of a fry cook. If you actually enjoy food and want something fresh and delicious, head down Damen to Chickpea.
