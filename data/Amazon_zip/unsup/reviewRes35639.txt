I like the new space they've moved too. Much more spacious and cleaner, although who really knows sometimes? The food was just okay though, and I've had way better in various "Chinatown" communities like this all over the country.  I tried their BBQ pork, which I'll admit, I don't eat a lot of pork anymore, so I was really hoping it would be as good as the kind I remember eating at First Chinese BBQ in Dallas. It wasn't bad at all, just unremarkable. I got a side of veggie fried rice, and that was borderline bad (I should have re-read my previous review). It always amazes me how these really authentic places can't seem to make a killer fried rice, you know, fluffy, savory, etc. This version was brown and bland and I had to douse it with chili oil and soy sauce just to stomach it. If you've ever had the light, fluffy, savory kind of Chinese fried rice before, you know what I mean about how the kind here sucks. Finally, as much as I realize this place is kind of a chop shop, the service was a disaster. Basically once my order was taken, my waitress never came back to help me again. I needed new napkins, tried to catch her attention, but it was like she didn't want to look in my direction. So I used some kleenex I had in my pocket. Then I wanted another beer, and she never came back over to see if I wanted another, so I never ended up getting it. They weren't even busy either, it was 4pm. Oh well, I'm not mad about it, it was just a little weird and bad business since they lost some more money I was willing to spend. Supposedly the whole duck is amazing, but that's usually not my thing. Maybe one day when I need to satisfy some friend's craving for roast duck, I'll be back to try it.
