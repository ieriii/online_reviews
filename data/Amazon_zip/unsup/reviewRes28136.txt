2 1/2 stars. I went around 2pm Thursday . I wanted to order the quesidillas with chille sauce on flour tortillas insted of corn. They practically laughed at me and said no. There was no justifiable reason not to honor my request. I chose the combo; Bean Tostada, Cheese Enchilada, Tamale and Beef Taco. While I was in the bathroom they left a complimentary corn tortilla with some ground beef in a soupy sauce. They should have waited until I was there because it was tepid ( and not very good) The food was served quickly. The tamale was quite good for a restaurants. I was pissed that the enchillada was automatically served with Mole' sauce since it wasn't mentioned on the menu ( This is partly my fault for not asking I guess) The second she served it I told her Mole wasn't listed on the menu, could she please change it. She said since it was already made they wouldn't change it. That's another strike for customer service. The Tostada was average, the Ground Beef Taco was well below average, no flavor! I couldn't wait to get out of there. When I went to pay the bill, she over charged me on top of everything. I told the cashier/manager and he didn't even apologize! I will give it another try in the future but ONLY because of the good reviews listed, otherwise I'd never go back there.
