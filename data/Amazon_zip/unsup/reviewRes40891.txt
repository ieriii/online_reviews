This is one of the best Mexican restaurants in Chicago. End of story! Their Carne Asada is simply delicious, and so is their chicken. Great salsa, but beware: it's pretty spicy!! Remember to ask for some pico de gallo if they don't bring it right away...it's incredible! The food is prepared quickly, and it is very affordable. Been going to this place for years, and it never ceases to amaze me. It's also open very late! I can't recommend La Pasadita highly enough.
