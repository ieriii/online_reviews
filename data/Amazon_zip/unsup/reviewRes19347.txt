I had dinner at the Gage this past Thursday night. Went with some friends from work. The service was really knowledgeable and helpful. Our server had a really good balance between knowing her stuff and no being uptight. Honestly, some of the best I've encountered in Chicago. During dinner the Manager stopped by to check on us and asked how everything was going. Nice touch! The food was good. Definitely a meat eater kind of menu. I did notice one or two vegetarian items on the menu. I had an apple/ice cream desert thing that I'll just skip next time. BTW, try the Old Fashioned. Seriously the best drink I've had in a long time.
