How have I never been here? Try the white pizza with pepperoni and banana peppers...oh my lord. So good! Piece automatically gets two stars because they serve their thin crust cut into triangles, no squares....I'm a California girl, we don't do square pizza in California. The rest of the stars go for the pure deliciousity that the pizza is! garlicky chewy crust with a generous amount of cheese and toppings....man, if I wasn't on a date, I would have eaten the whole thing...but I had to act "civilized" ...that and I didn't bring my elastic, eatin' jeans.
