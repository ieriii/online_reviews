There are some things that Calo does very well, for example most of their Italian foods and Pizza, but they certainly left me wanting when I ordered their Ribs. Last time I ordered them was a few years back, moved away..yada yada...came back...looking forward to a delicious slab of ribs...yum...yum...ordered and received the driest and tiniest slab I've ever seen (more lake a slabette!) at a full slab price! Needless to say, bummer. Sometimes you just can't go back.
