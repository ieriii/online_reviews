Sorry but this place is over rated. Every one raves, but the food is served cafeteria style. Everything looks yellow like some old folks buffet. Taste was bland. I mean, at least give ti some kick, you're supposed to be middle eastern food. And it is not dirt cheap like you might expect from the decor and presentation. Slop me some rice and chicken. Again, i am sorry. I had high hopes. I try it again but the myth is over.
