Complete A$$Holes...Litterally the worst customer service of any place in Chicago. They called and claimed they had a big SEWER LEAK and they had to cancel my reservation. THIS WAS 2 HRS before we were supposed to arrive. They said the place was closed for the night. The guy on the phone, SETH, claimed to be the manager when I asked to speak with one. What MANAGER takes reservation calls? To add insult to injury, they were NOT closed as he claimed, we went there and the place was packed. SHWA? GO F yourself.
