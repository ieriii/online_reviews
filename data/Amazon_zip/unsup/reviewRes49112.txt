I love the Publican. I love the Publican because it has amazing food: the potted rillettes, the whole chicken, the fries with egg, and the dover sole are some of my favorites. I love the Publican because it has amazing beer ... *and* it has a beer sommelier ... *and* it seems like everyone on the staff knows beer better than anyone anywhere. (But don't take my word for it--go in, tell them what you like in a beer, and they *will* find something that's the best beer you ever had.) I love the Publican because the staff is over-the-top helpful. Besides those amazing beer powers I mentioned, they know the dishes better than I know my own refrigerator, they are never-ending cheerful, and they make me feel welcome every freakin' time I come in. I love the Publican!
