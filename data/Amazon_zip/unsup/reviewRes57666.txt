Not too shab for cheap mexican food in the neighborhood.The service - fast and abundant.The food - mostly delicious, although some items (tamales) taste as though they've been sitting under a heat lamp all day.Overal - I do not believe they are as AMAZING as everyone rants and raves, but they are decent. Love their free small appetizer with the meal.Good dishes - mole!
