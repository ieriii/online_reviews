Simply It is simply it! I had to break out the pun for this review because as far as Vietnamese food in Chicago goes, Simply It is my favorite restaurant. It's BYOB with a cozy atmosphere with nice ambience. Great for a date, a bite to eat, or take out. Since leaving San Francisco I have found great pho hard to come by, but Simply it has amazing Beef pho and their Chicken pho is wonderful when you are feeling under the pho. Their pho is authentic and made from scratch so the broth is fantastic! I also enjoy their lunch combos and they have tremendous serving/portion sizes. The service is extremely efficient, friendly and on top of their jobs. Definitely one of my favorite restaurants to eat in Chicago!
