Now, I know why the line is always soooo damn long to eat here!! This is probably one of the best breakfast spots Ive ever been too. If I could, I would eat here everyday! They're menu is a lil overwhelming.. good overwhelming. It just means they have so many options. And let me tell you - they are all YUMMY (not that Ive had everything, but I have sampled quite a few dishes). Its soooo hard to decide sometimes. But whatever you pick- ya cant go wrong. You can get something sweet, savory, rich, light, anything and everything. Down right "make your tummy happy" food! The service is awesome, the decor its really cool too. And its a lot bigger than you would think. Added plus is there are lots of booths - so that's a good thing for booth lovers , like me.
