Hopleaf has probably become my favorite bar in Chicago. A friend brought me here after a Cubs game this summer and I fell in love with the great Belgian beer selection and steamed mussels. A little over a week ago, I hosted a graduation party for my wife in their private event room and we had a fantastic experience. The price was very reasonable, the food was great, and the bartender was superb. The big pot of mussels was perfect. They served some of the best sandwiches I've had--the duck reuben was simply incredible. I highly recommend Hopleaf for hanging out or for a private event.
