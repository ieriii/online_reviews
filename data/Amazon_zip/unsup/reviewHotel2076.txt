I had my wedding here two weeks ago and absolutely everything about the whole weekend was perfect. Barbara Martin is the wedding coordinator and was just amazing. She is organized, makes your feel very comfortable and confident, attentive and responsive. Everything a bride needs leading up to her wedding! Although my husband and I live in Chicago - almost all of our family friends do not, so almost all of our 115 guests were staying at the hotel. It was very easy to get a room block that could accommodate and everyone we spoke to since the wedding has nothing but amazing things to say about their experience, the rooms, service and of course - the views!! Mart Plaza starts on the 15th floor of the Chicago Suntimes building and looks out over the river and the Chicago skyline. They also give the bride/groom and the bride/groom's parents their room free the night of the wedding. This is on top of their VERY reasonably priced rooms for wedding blocks. In addition, my husband's parents are divorced and they gave both sets of parents the free night. The ceremony, cocktail reception, and move into the reception was swift and flawless. The food was delicious. I really feel this venue provides a huge amount of value for your money. I highly, highly recommend the Holiday Inn Mart Plaza for your wedding!!
