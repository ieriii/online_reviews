Checked it out on a Sat and got a seat right away on the balcony. Great cocktails(I recommend the Logan Palmer). And had a 3 Floyds Devil's Handshake. We split a bunch of the plates. Meatballs were fantastic and could have eaten 3 orders of them. The gnuddi was really tasty too. Foie gras with funnel cake was good but a little pricey for the portion.
