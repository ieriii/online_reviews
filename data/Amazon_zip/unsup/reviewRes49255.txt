My favorite thing about this place is that I used to live a block away. Oh, how I dream of those better days (let's give a round of applause to building foreclosure!) ANYWAY. This place is seriously amazing. Great mug of coffee and I'm very keen on their almond croissant/cheese croissant/any croissant...basically i gained 10 lbs from eating these things and I'm OK with it. Their cookies are so-so. Cupcakes are usually good, especially the red velvet and carrot, unless you get a stinky old one that tastes like dry, crumbly garbage. Cakes displayed in the window automatically pull you in (it's like some creepy gravitational pull they must have). What's really awesome is that you can be extremely productive (for real) next door in the wi-fi lounge. Every chair is pretty much filled and if you even THINK about talking gossip in there with your friends, you will automatically feel ashamed and lazy in comparison to the surrounding people on their laptops. Yep, this place is pretty dang cool. My recommendation combo: coffee. croissant. that paper you put off writing.
