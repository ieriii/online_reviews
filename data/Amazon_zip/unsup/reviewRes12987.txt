Loved this place! We had a party of seven, which is the minimum to make a reservation. So fortunately we were able to get a table right away at 7pm on a Friday night. The atmosphere is great...dimmed lighting, exposed brick....very cozy. We had an attentive waiter who was also quite good looking ;) He kept the mojitos coming, which were the best I had ever had. I've had a lot of mojitos in my day...even in miami and these were still the best. We got a round of three or four appetizers. Everything was very good but the shrimp quesadillas were my favorite. I ordered the honey jalapeno pork chops as an entree. I got TWO huge pork chops that came with mashed sweet potatoes. Wow! Sooo good and not super spicy as you might think. Loved it! The price was in line with the amount of food I got, which provided plenty of leftovers for the next day. If you have the chance to go to Cafe 28, do it! YUM.
