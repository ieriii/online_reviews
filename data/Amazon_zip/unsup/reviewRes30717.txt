Came here for my bday. Reservations at 5. Got really busy around 6. Strawberry Delight - yum I LOVE strawberry drinks. not very strong though Blushing Geisha - good stronger than strawberry drink. Beef lollipops - comes with 5 lollipops. good not the most amazing thing ever. Rock shrimp tempura - basically honey walnut shrimp. very good i love this dish but i wish the shrimp was bigger. i've had bigger for cheaper. Sisig - best dish i had here. not on the menu but ask for it you won't be sorry. basically pork belly with fried egg in the middle. soo good but a bit tiny! Garlic Rice - $5 but SO good. nice and garlicy! perfect with the sisig Ridiculous dessert - good but mostly ice cream covered not much carrot cake. i would get it again though Good birthday dinner overall. I do want to come back but I don't have cravings to come anytime soon.
