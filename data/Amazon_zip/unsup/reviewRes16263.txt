I'd enjoyed martinis here before but came last night for dinner for the first time. Yum. Yum. Yum. We got here at maybe 7:30 on a Friday night and waited 20 minutes or so. The great thing is they have those pagers so you can go window shop in the neighborhood as you wait. We were seated by the front windows which I enjoyed for the view, but had to keep my coat on all dinner because of the draft. But the food. Good Lord. The man and I both ordered pasta dishes-- his was tortlaci (sp?), sort of like ravioli, a recipe his grandmother used to make. He loved it, though the noodles were larger and thicker than he was used to. Mine was called something that started with a p and was basically wide linguini noodles with three or four different kinds of mushrooms, a creamy wine sauce, and the biggest, plumpest grilled shrimp you've ever seen. Hey guys. All the pasta here is made in-house and you can tell. It's amazing. AND DESSERT!!! We got cannolli and tiramisu. I think they were the best Italian desserts I've had in this city. The texture of the crispy cannolli with the sweet creamy cheese and the pistachios... Derek thought the chocolate sauce upstaged everything else, but, well... I'm never one to criticize the presence of chocolate. The tiramisu. Wow. Not too alcoholic or thick or soft or even too cold or too warm. Just perfect. I can't wait to come back here in the spring and really enjoy one of those front window seats!
