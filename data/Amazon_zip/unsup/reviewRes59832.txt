The entrees are deeeeeeeelish. The staff is about as wonderful and accommodating as staff could be. Deserts were a little mediocre but above all I had a wonderful first experience. I am also glad someone else paid because from what I could tell it was pretttttty expensive. If someone offers to take me, I'd definitely return!
