Give Italy the boot & Go Brazilian! Yes, the perfect food has found a fertile field among the people known for their perfect bodies: The People of Brazil. Perhaps. Or perhaps I'm just late to the party. But I'm coming in hungry as hell off the Red Line. Can you help a brother? "Sim! Sim!" Living in Chicago God knows I've grown up eating my share of craptastic thick and thin messes of old red paste supposedly grown from tomatoes(?), shredded cheddar & dead bread that someone sold to me as "pizza". (I don't want to think about the pounds of Italian beef probably clogging me up for years to come.) Not with Fogo 2 Go. The food is relatively light yet filling. It's a nice experience. I'd definitely go back again & again.
