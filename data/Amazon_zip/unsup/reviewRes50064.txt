To be fair I have only been to this restaurant once. On my usual travels to the Windy City, I met up with my boyfriend and some of his family members. They wanted to treat us to their favorite restaurant, ie. Las Tablas. My first experience with chimichurri was good... even with all that fresh garlic and coriander I did not get heartburn (wheew!) I ordered grilled baby octopus and was not impressed.  The seafood was rubbery and hard to break up in my mouth- Indicative of either poor quality products or an inexperienced grilled master. The rest of the crew ordered steak.. though heavy it was very flavorful. The highlight of my meal was the yucca side dish that came with my platter. The unique flavor and texture was perfected! However, a couple of stars were docked because of service and ambience. The service was poor. Even on a night with few covers, the waiter came by the table once after ordering and my water glass and dropped utensil suffered. In my opinion, if owners are going to remodel and expand, then please spend some money to train or rather retrain the waitstaff. Secondly, the ambience was very drafty and austere for a Latin restaurant. I was hoping for live music or at least some music to add to the experience. However I just heard the rumbling murmur of other conversations... how boring for a culture that embraces a colorful livelihood.
