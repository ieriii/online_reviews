There's one thing that I've enjoyed at Alliance Bakery - their lemon bars. Have been coming back at least once a week since November to try something new, never to be impressed. Will not be stopping by anymore. Was attempting to put on a bakesale for a charity organization and got in touch with four bakeries on Division. Alliance, and especially Michael Nitschky, the retail manager, was the least accessible and professional of them all. To get just a *response* - what ensued: I stopped in, told to email; emailed, never got a response; stopped in again a few days later, was told Michael would get the letters/brochures I printed out by 9AM; received no call, even though they were aware that the sale was happening in the afternoon; finally called again past 11AM when I received no word; he answered the phone with "this is Michael" and I had to brief him about everything as if he hadn't really gotten any messages. It's not a big deal if you can't help -- the least you can do is respond when the decision is so clear-cut on your end and keep us from waiting around with our hopes up. It was easier to get a hold of (and positive response from) more corporate Sprinkles Cupcakes.
