We were unsure at first - our 8:30 reservation on Friday was not in their book and there was quite a line, but the host was quick to make sure we were seated at a nice table in the back room. The two pasta dishes we tried were quite tasty, and the portion sizes were good for the price. Along with a bottle of Pinot and we came out to $85 for the evening. All in all, we liked the atmosphere - intimate yet lively with an attentive wait staff.
