now im not all in love with meat like my kids are, i came here only because i knew they would like it. i have been to fogo so i had a good idea of what to expect. well i had a drink but cant remember the name it was the one with strawberries it was good. salad bar was full of stuff that i dont like, like salad. the lobster bisque had a nice flavor but there was no lobster in it which kinda ruined it for me. i had a few pieces of cheese. um so i dont like plantains so i didnt eat those but the mashed potatoes were good. i dont like pink meat and idont wanna hear how cooking it all the way takes the flavor away so they were kinda getting pissed cause it seems like no pink is a special order. for a sunday afternoon we were seated quickly the place is pretty inside my sons loved looking at her spin around and they loved the place, they just ate and ate and ate so like i said this was not a dinner for me, they loved it and thats really all that matter to me, but they are young men so all they tell me is everything was good
