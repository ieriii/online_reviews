I stopped in here with my Mom for dinner one night on a whim. Not knowing anything about the place beforehand, we immediately picked up on that it had to be owned/operated by the same people as the Cheesecake Factory (which is more or less across the street at the John Hancock Building). The food was good, what you'd expect from a Cheesecake factory type place, and the portions were huge and the menu extensive (something for everyone, of course!). We took a chance and ordered the beignets in advance (didn't like that you had to order dessert bf you were ready, though), but we weren't dissappointed. Those beignets were great! The high point of the meal. Needless to say, we left satisfied and really enjoyed the dessert. For the area, its probably one of the more reasonably priced places and we didn't have to wait at all, which was a plus.
