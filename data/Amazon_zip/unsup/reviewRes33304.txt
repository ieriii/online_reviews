I Love Yolk. They have healthy alternatives for people like me that workout daily and I'm a personal trainer here in Chicago. I have been eating breakfast 2-3 a week (Wells location) since they have be open. I moved to the South Loop and I eat at that location at least once a week. But the customer services, wait staff and food is just not up to par as the Wells Location is. Last week I stopped in for breakfast at the Wells location and its is still the BEST. Everything was good...service, wait staff and food. I MISS IT!! I wish they could do as good as job over at the South Loop location as they do at the River North Yolk. I would be there everyday. By the way I get the scrambler: egg whites turkey sausage green peppers Salsa on the side Multi-grain toast Fruit instead of potatoes Soooo good!!
