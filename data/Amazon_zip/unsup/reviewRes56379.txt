Recently my friend's birthday was thrown here. I came in from the suburbs and was a bit late, as luck made it. I came in when they were still waiting on their table because the place was packed at the time.It wasn't too bad, we waited only twenty minutes, but I was really impressed that we got tons of little finger food appetizers while we waited. It made me feel like the owner really cared and did the best he could possibly do while we were waiting. The wait wasn't too bad either, we were talking, making up for lost times and before the party knew it. Our table was ready!By then, we had all sat down got all our orders in. The service is so great here! they were able to get us in and out for our movie, the food came out quickly everything being delicious- of course!they made sure we had everything we needed, all waters were filled, everyone had their wine glass, and that everyone's food was tasting good for themselves. I personally had the coconut mango beef! one of the best choices on the menu, I wouldn't mind ordering it again the next time, and another time and maybe the next next time I come in again.
