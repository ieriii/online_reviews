My family and I wanted to eat something other than Christmas dinner leftovers on 12.26 so we went in search of an open restaurant. We just happened to be driving down Milwaukee when all of a sudden I saw the sign and yelled "Stop! We're gonna try Revolution tonight!" We were doing an earlier dinner (6 pm) and it's the day after Christmas so we were super lucky to have no wait but there was definitely a wait within 5 minutes of us sitting down. Had a good vibe - neighborhood people just enjoying general holiday merriment with friends and family - and felt super cozy right when you walk in (prolly because of the fireplace) We tried the Cross of Gold (prolly their most middle of the road beer), Bottoms Up (wheat beer) and the Fistmas Ale (the seasonal ale). All had its own distinct and fabulous taste and even my mom, who does not drink more than a sip of any alcohol at a sitting, was definitely asking for "another tasting" of all of them. The food was actually what was more impressive. Since we'd been eating and laying around all weekend (the way to really do the holidays) we weren't starving so we shared the steamed mussel appetizer (the white ale, celery, shallot kind - super fresh mussels and amazing broth), charcuterie platter ( when we went it was all house made kielbasa, jalapeno sausage, super thinly sliced pork tenderloin, and pork rillet with a strawberry and blueberry compote, all served with a few slices of dark rye bread - all of it was soooo good and we were even raving about the mustard on the side!), the apple pork pizza (not awesome but not bad either - a bit bland and could use some color - maybe throw an arugula salad on top of it?), and the forest burger (my sister is a super picky eater so this was her dish but of course I had to have a bite - delicious meat, she requested medium and it was cooked perfectly to specification, and fabulously creamy mashed potato as a side). Making mom, dad, and sister happy is always tough but this place left all of us super happy and full.
