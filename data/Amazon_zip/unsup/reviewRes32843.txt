Most recently ate there two weeks ago. The vegan raw burger is the best thing I've eaten at Chicago Diner, available for a limited time as I understand it. I found the sheppards pie, ravioli, and another dish that I ate but can't remember all to be rather bland. I've had way more flavorful vegan dishes at other vegan restaurants in the city. This was my second attempt at trying to like Chicago Diner, and I still don't see what the fervor is all about.
