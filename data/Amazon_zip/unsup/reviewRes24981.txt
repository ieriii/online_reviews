Five Stars on level of service and Atmosphere Gejas is amazing Four Stars on Level of food everything was very good and huge quantities, price was pretty high Three Stars on fondue in general....its hard work, and you multitasking when your in a mood to relax. Cooking, drinking and conversating all at the same time...we left tired, but it really is Fundue hahahah.....awwwww! so a four star overall
