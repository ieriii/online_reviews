Came back here on a date for what else but Tiger Cry, Crab Rangoon, and Chicken Pad Thai....aka TRIPLE THREAT. Yo yo yo listen up...this Thai food is LEGIT. They changed the game with the Tiger Cry appetizer. It's probably called Tiger Cry because tigers weep over how effin' good this beef appetizer is. The Crab Rangoon dough is the best crispy yet chewy dough I've ever had on crab rangoon...and they don't skimp on the filling either. Dip it in the sauce and enjoy. Lastly the Chicken Pad Thai is perfect. PERFECT. If you look up perfect in the dictionary you will see a picture of Opart's pad thai...with soft noodles freshly sauced off the wok, this Thai staple packs FLAVOR. Service was quick. Kitchen was even quicker. AND ITS BYOB, no corkage fee! I picked up a bottle of Riesling at the liquor store NEXT DOOR. Well decorated, traditional decor with a modern feel. Right off the Brown Line "L" stop @ Western Avenue! GET SOME!
