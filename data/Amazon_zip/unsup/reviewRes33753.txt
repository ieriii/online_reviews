You can't go f*cking wrong with this place. Cheap as hell, and f*cking good. There are endless reasons why you should go here for dinner, lunch, or for a falafel fix, which is why this is as loquacious as I'm going to get with THIS review. Run, don't walk here. You honestly can't beat the quality, the amount of food, OR the price.
