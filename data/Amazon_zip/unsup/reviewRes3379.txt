After months of talking about going to Crisp, I finally wound up in it's delicious embrace. After embarking on one of the most incredible, flavorful food journeys to date, I knew I had to immediately write a review to praise the Crisp Masters. So, here I am. Thanks to the hundreds of reviews recommending the Seoul Sassy, I decided to try it.. My boyfriend and I tried the Seoul Sassy half chicken and the Suicide Buffalo wings. Both meals were exquisite, each bite an explosion of mouthwatering flavors and spices. Everything about the chicken was prepared perfectly. The chicken was so moist and tender, as chicken should be. As a result, the Seoul Sassy brought out my animal instincts, for I felt like a wild beast eating that meal. I hastily devoured my Seoul Sassy, slapping my boyfriends greasy hands away and snarling when he would come near. After all the chicken was gone, I went back and ate scraps of skin. As gross as this may sound, that skin is to die for, so crispy and savory. I am officially addicted to Crisp. I regret not visiting months ago. Definitely one of my new go-to spots in Chicago.
