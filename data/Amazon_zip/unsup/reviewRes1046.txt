Worth the hype. One of the best eating experiences I've had in the city. Yeah, you gotta wait outside for about 20 minutes (we arrived right at noon), but it's part of the charm and well worth it. Doug himself takes your order once you get up there. He's funny and friendly and really wants you to enjoy his place. And you will. While they have hot dogs, Polish, and other standard hot dog stand fare, I suggest the specialty sausages. I got the Thai sausage and a spicy cheesy thing, and both blew me away. I wanted to actually try all of them, and will eventually go back to do so. Maybe not the best hot dog place in the city--the hot dogs are good but not special--but the specialty sausages are worth making the trip, waiting in line, and plucking the money down for. I wish I was there right now.
