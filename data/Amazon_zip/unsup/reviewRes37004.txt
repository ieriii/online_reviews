I used to live in Chicago about four years ago and loved Hopleaf. The beer selection was great and the mussels were always good. We were back in Chicago for Memorial Day and the first place we went was Hopleaf to grab a couple drinks and mussels around 4:30p. The front bar area was packed so we asked for a table in the restaurant and were seated upstairs, after arguing with the hostess about whether mussels and drinks constituted "full service dining". We waited for almost 20 minutes for the server to take our drink and food order. I thought about leaving, but for old time's sake we wanted to stay. The place was not busy in the restaurant. There were many empty tables, but it still took forever. We finally placed our order and that was the last time we saw our server until she dropped of the check. Thankfully, the bus boy was never too far away to fill up our water and then also bring us more bread for the mussel broth. This place used to be great, but the service sucks and they staff (other than the bus boy) is less than helpful. I definitely won't be back next time I'm in Chicago. It's really gone downhill.
