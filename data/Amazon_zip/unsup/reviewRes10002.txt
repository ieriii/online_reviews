After living in the area for a long time, I finally had the opportunity to check out Piece. It has a great atmosphere and they make a darn good wheel (albeit dilapidated from the 16"x24" sheets they serve the pie). It is definitely a younger crowd and had a college feel to it, but everyone was very pleasant. The beer is good and our server was very attentive. If I had to pick one negative, it would be that the air conditioning was not powerful enough to cool the entire space. They'll need to get that fixed. I'm sure we'll be back soon. It's really a lot of fun.
