Came here for my cousins birthday. They were very nice, I believe the Schaumburg location serves lunch at a very reasonable price, less than $30 if i remember correct;y. Huge salad bar with hot and cold side dish options as well. If you're a meat lover, you have to come try it out for lunch. -1 star because they didn't have some of the cuts I was looking for when we came inf or lunch.
