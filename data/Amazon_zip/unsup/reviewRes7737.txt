Fantastic. It starts when you gorge yourself on smoked salmon and artichoke hearts. It continues when you start eating the first bite of the 7 cuts of meat from the dudes walking around with them. You take a bite, and before you can finish there's another dude there with more meat! After this happens a few times, you begin to expect it and get angry when they're replenishing their meat-poles. "MORE MEAT!", you yell while your compatriots try to flip your little meat-man-signaling card to RED (which means, "Dear lord, I cannot possibly eat more meat, oh, ok, one more serving, just for you, you adorable skirt-wearing meat-man").  It continues when your friend decides he will eat 5 different animals in one bite and you think it's hilarious because you are delerious on meat. The delerium lasts for about 20 minutes and when you come down, you are amazed that you just got high on meat. You decide to try again. It ends when you laugh at the meat-man when he asks if you want dessert (and burp up a bit of delicious meat). You can't see the bill because you're so full of meat your eyes are watering as they fall -- you just want to take a nap. They open the double doors and roll you through the loop. You sleep like a bear, dreaming of more meat-bearing skirt-men.
