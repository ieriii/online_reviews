Yum! Great southern food right in Andersonville. I had the pulled pork sandwich, which was delicious. I also had the Hibiscus Margarita--you should have one. The best part was that our server heard my friend mention that she was going to order something for her husband and brought out cornbread on the house for my friend to take home!
