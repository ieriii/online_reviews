Yeah it's a chain. I don't usually do chains. But, this place is pretty rad. They have beaucoup options for all types of persnickety eaters--gluten free, low carb, vegetarian, etc. The creme brulee and freshed baked cookies are fantastic. The southwest style salad is huge, but delish. I've eaten here several times and the service has always been great--the waiters are very friendly and the hosts seat quickly. It's right on Michigan Ave, so in the summer, it gets especially busy. If you're 21+ and with just one or two people, go to the bar--there's rarely a wait to sit there.
