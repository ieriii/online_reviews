Hands down the best Cuban/ Ethnic food in town.This is a great place for a date night or even just a great place for Sunday brunch.The Caribbean flavors are are wonderfully put together to make it one of my top five restaurants in Chicago.Cafe 28's Sunday brunch was rated by Rachel Ray as one of the best Sunday brunches in the country so we had to see for ourselves and I must say that it was absolutely wonderfully delicious and full of fun live Latin Jazz music.We loved it!!!
