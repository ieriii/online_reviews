I have been going to the one in Scottsdale for over 10 years and I've always considered that one of the best places I've eaten and this one is better. Bottom line is the lay-out and decor was just grand and awesome and if you're looking to entertain clients or have a big night out I think there is no better place in Chicago. Yes its a chain but like Capital Grille its a damn good one and if you didn't know it was a chain you'd never even think to ask. We were fortunate to get in for the pre+pening on Wednesday which I heard was the much better night to go and the spread was outrageous. The seafood spread alone was worth going!
