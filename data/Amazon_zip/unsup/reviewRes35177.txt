duck made 3 ways-slice roasted duck with buns, duck wintermelon soup, and duck fried rice. no waste of the duck..woot! totally fed 6 people.  roasted duck, in particular, wasnt the best ive had, skin couldve been crispier. concept was tempting! also shared salt/pepper tofu and chinese broccoli. service was much better than expected in a chinese restaurant, although slower as well...
