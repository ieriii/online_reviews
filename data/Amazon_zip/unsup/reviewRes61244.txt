I'll never forget my first Gino's East Pizza, not just because it happened to be our main course at a huge swinging Bachelor party. Wow, what a night, but the pizza is my clearest memory. That deep, delicious crust, topped with loads of cheese, sauce, onion, mushroom, and more cheese. The ultimate topping was a complete solid layer of sausage. It was the infamous patty topped deep dish cheese sausage mushroom onion. Even with the myriad of tantalizing treats around - all I could think of was that pizza. So began a marriage of man and pizza. Like many things in life, Gino's East must be experienced.
