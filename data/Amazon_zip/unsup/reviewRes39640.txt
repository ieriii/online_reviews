I am very particular about Korean food, especially since I hail from LA! I am fond of hole-in-the-wall kind of joints, and this place was very reminiscent of local hangouts in LA. The seating is great for groups of people. The ambience isn't much, really. But the food makes up for it. You can get meat to grill; I would recommend the bulgogi and kalbi for first-timers. Also, their stews are absolutely delicious. I like their kimchi stew! Word to the wise: wear plain clothes because once you step out, you're going to smell like your meal. The one thing that bothered me is that they charge for rice. This is the first time I've ever had to pay for rice separately at a Korean restaurant, especially for meager portions. Service can be kinda finnicky too. But otherwise, this is an awesome place to eat late at night with friends while drinking soju!
