Everything from ambience to food is great. Excellent customer service, nice dim lighting and the food- yummy. Had goi bo, snapper( ca chien saigon) , tom xao sate (suted jumbo shrimp, asparagus, onions & scallions, in a light sauce of sate spice, chili, & garlic)-- all fabulous. would go back again and again.
