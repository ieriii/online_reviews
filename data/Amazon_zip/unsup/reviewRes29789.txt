I have yet to have a bad experience at an Italian-ish eatery, but I was very happy here. I had the angel hair pasta with meatballs, and shared the Waldorf salad (with walnuts). Both were very good. Meatballs were very soft (a little more than I like, I like some texture), and no complaints on the salad. Nice and tangy. Our waiter was very nice and patient with my giant and loud group. We had the moscato, which was very sweet and delicious. Prices were not bad at all. I expected it to be more. The ambiance is dim and romantic.
