Again Chicago food scene, you disappoint. I love small dishes and went here late night a couple weeks ago. Love that the kitchen stays open late in a town where you can't seem to have dinner past 10p.m. So was super excited to try this place. The restaurant was tiny but cute and seemed young and had great energy. They also have a great wine list, we had a reasonably priced Rose. That's where the positives end. This is what me and a friend ordered-- the octopus, the fried prosciutto balls, the shaved brussel sprouts and the porchetta sandwich. To be fair, we both thought 1/4 of the meal was outstanding (the octopus and the brussel sprouts). Here's my issue-- how can a place screw up pork?? It's delicious and hard to go wrong. I can't say what happened with the prosciutto balls but the porchetta had Rosemary in it, giving it an odd flavor. So they kind of fail in my book if they can't make pork taste good--it's like making a gross cupcake, you think, how can this be possible. I mean, really, it may have been the first time I've had a bad porchetta sandwich. Sorry for the tangent but that's unacceptable to me. So I'm giving the place two stars because we did like two dishes and because I would recommend it-- for drinks only.
