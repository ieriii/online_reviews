You can't beat the bang for your buck factor. Sizzling crepe #12 was just pretty good. The sauce was delicious but it was too oily. The phos are all spectacular. Although there's nothing out there that's not enhanced by srirachacha (rooster sauce to some people) and hoisin sauce. The spring rolls are fine too but nothing extraordinary. I used to frequent Dong Ky which is further south of Tank on Broadway in a shopping mall. However the pho broth there is usually way too salty because it gets reduced so much. That's why I'm glad my friend took me to Tank. It's a good medium between overly reduced and under reduced broth.
