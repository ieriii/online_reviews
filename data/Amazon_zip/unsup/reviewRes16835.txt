This is the best Indian Buffet I think I'll have in Chicago. I could probably have been ridiculously happy just eating the unlimited naan and the free tandoori chicken they provided (seriously, that naan is to die for). The other items on the buffet were equally as delicious, especially the lamb (I have a thing for lamb). After 2 very large, full plates of all the buffet had to offer, I definitely didn't have room for dessert- but did it anyway and was happy I did. The mango ice cream was slightly on the melted side but a nice change from the flavor intensive buffet.
