I had heard about this place while researching my trip to Chicago. I had to wait an hour in the cold but it was well worth it. I ordered the Enchiladas de Mole Poblano and the tamales de carnitas. The enchiladas had chicken and black beans inside and it was awesome!!! The tamales was filled with pork and some kind of flavored sauce. It was great and better that the tamales that I have eaten in Texas. Overall it was a great meal and now I know why this place is so popular.
