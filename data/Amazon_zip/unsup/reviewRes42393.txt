Drinks = fun (I agree with fellow yelper Stephen W., the Dark & Stormy is the way to go, Pim's cup is a close second)! Atmosphere = trendy Food = menu looked creative and yummy (we didn't eat, but would love to go back) Decor = cozy I will def come back for food....reminded me a bit of Stanton Social Club in NYC. Loved it!
