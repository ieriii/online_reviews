I went here on a Wednesday night, at 9:30pm- it was slow at first yet picked up around 10pm, the atmosphere was laid back and relaxed. Low lighting and great friendly faces. The server was knowledgeable and friendly, we had an appetizer as well as the sunrise, service (these two were bad!!! no sauce or flavoring) and the dragon and the volcano roll, those two were amazing!!! Dessert was fruit- ice cream with chocolate sauce very delicious- this sushi restaurant uses a lot of mango which is unique and great!! Overall a great choice! I would go back!!
