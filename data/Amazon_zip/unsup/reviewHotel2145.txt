Instead of falling victim to an overpriced and underwhelming New Year's Eve "Bar Party" my boyfriend and I decided we would do it up nice and stay d-town in a hoighty-toighty hotel. After much research, we settled on the Intercontinental because the price wasn't TOO outrageous and location was well, perfect.  First the bad. Upon check-in at 3PM, my bf was presented with a "contract" promising he would not bring booze into our room. Um, OK. Hopefully that was just a NYE thing because it was totally LAME (and I may have snucky some booze in anyway. Or not. Shhh).  Also valet parking was 40 bones. After the room price, that is a little steep but fair I guess for downtown 24-hour parking. As for the good, our room was very nice. The bed was heavenly and I think I could live in it (I found refuge in those pillows as we painfully watched the Bears blow it. Awesome we had planned our evening around that). I also found the room to be really clean (but who really knows these days, especially after watching Dateline when they show those microscopic bugs - ew). Highlights included the bar - great people watching, especially that night because there was a wedding. Drinks were pricey as expected but the staff was nice. I did find a SHARD of glass in my martini before I was, oh about to swallow it (wouldn't that have been a Happy New Year?) but the bartender apologetically gave me a new one at no charge.  Shards aside, I had a good experience at the Intercontinental. It's pretty solid and RIGHT on Michigan across from Nordstrom. I would recommend that an out-of-towner shacks up here for a visit.
