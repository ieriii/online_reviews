This place does a great job of keeping the traditional chinese flavors in dishes that are quite westernized. The walnut shrimp is one of the best I've had since it's not overwhelmed with mayo (like Joy Yee's walnut shrimp) and it's light and crispy even when tossed in the cream sauce. The spicy shrimp is excellent - crispy and super spicy. Tony's chicken was sweet and fried to perfection, the governer's chicken was average. The service is not great but like I've said of other asian restaurants, this is to be expected.
