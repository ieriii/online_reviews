100th review!! :) I thought that this was going to be okay. Turns out I LOVE it. I cant wait to go back with out of towners. Definitely not a neighborhood place but much better than I anticipated. The server was great! It wasnt as expensive as I thought it was going to be. We were there on a wednesday and they had great live music and salsa dancing in the bar. Really fun and the food was so good!!!!! 5 stars for sure, if I could I would give it more.
