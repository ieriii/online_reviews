Ever since I've become a "gourmet chef" I have a whole new appreciation for Fox & Obel. And by gourmet chef I mean I can now make a salmon dish, a tilapia dish, and some delicious turkey tacos. You're impressed- aren't ya? I used to stop by Fox & Obel for their sushi (very good in comparison to other grocery stores) and other prepared foods, but today I found myself admiring their meat departments and all different spices. Wow, I think I may have been domesticated... It's definitely expensive, but I don't find the prices anymore than at Whole Foods. So grab your checkbook and head on over...and be sure to make a stop in their impressive candy section as well!
