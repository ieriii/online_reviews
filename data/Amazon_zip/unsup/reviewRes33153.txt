My girlfriend and I paid a visit to Little Bucharest this past Friday to see a friend of hers sing with the Jazz ensemble that was performing there that night. I wasn't sure what to expect given the location but I'll try anything when it comes to restaurants. When we got there, we were one of two tables but by the end of the evening, there were a decent amount of parties to make for a pleasant atmosphere, especially with the great music. The lighting, as the night wore on, created an intimate ambiance for our dinner which quickly turned into one of the most fantastic evenings we've shared out. Both of our meals looked amazing and, when I remembered to eat it (don't ask me to explain this to you), the stuffed cabbage was excellent. This was also the first time I've had Saganaki and now I'm thinking about trying that in my kitchen. However, I'm pretty sure my landlord wouldn't appreciate me burning a hole in the ceiling. We spent our evening drinking dirty martinis, enjoying flaming cheese, and getting lost in the candlelight which, at least to me, had already made for a perfect night out. Eventually the restaurant ran out of olive juice and that's when the owner (we LOVED this man) (at least I'm assuming he's the owner) went out and purchased more for us. How can you resist this level of service? This place really knows how to take care of their patrons. The free shots we were treated to while we waited were also a nice welcome. We're definitely going back to Little Bucharest and we may even take advantage of the limo service next time.
