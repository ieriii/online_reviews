HMMMM, well I've been here twice, and pretty much the second time warranted the current rating. I've been to hella korean wing spots all over the place and it was one of the few things I was looking for in my new home....Chicago First time I came here a few months back, the seoul sassy chicken wings were pretty decent....small, sweet and garlicy ^_~...I thought I found myself a new wing spot....2nd time around dude, the wings were MASSIVE....could barely taste the batter and there was so much DRY chicken, not to mention grease yo.... On a good note, I did try the Seoul Steak bowl, which was pretty tasty, and the Bulgogi was fairly tender -2 stars for the chicken -3 for the bulgogi -0 stars for no alcohol....this is a wing place right???...where's the beer....i don't want a vitamin water or a pellagrino duuu At least this place is not as bad as Toyose in San Francisco, Ca....I would write a review for them, but you can't give negative stars. My opinion: 1. OB Bear (Los Angeles, Ca) 2. KyoChon (NYC or LA) 3. Bon Chon (but just the one in Midtown - hella good dranks too with a loungy atmosphere) 4. SO (San Francisco, Ca) 5. Prince Cafe (Los Angeles, Ca)
