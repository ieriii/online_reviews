This place is a great buy for those folks looking to feast on giant turkey-esque wings and a can a pop. You shall not pass --- this place up! The bowls are kind of standard; rice with pretty toppings and some spectacular sauces. Once mixed in, the powers combine like Voltron in your mouth and kick your ass. Pretty nice for $9 bucks, or so. Now the stars of this parade of bad-ass are the monstro-wings in the signature sauces and bits of sauted green onion end bits. OMFG, from tip to joint, the best wings I've had here in the City. Beats Duff's like it was its prison bitch. Read my review on that disappointment, ok? Anyway, huge mutant chicken in my basket, in my mouth, with a side of crispy fries and the vanilla cream soda in less than 10 minutes? I just came a little thinking about it again. There was also this cute brunette with a nice butt sitting at the next table. I should totally Craigslist her on Missed Connections; "Hey, I came at the dinner table. Call me!!!" Overall, the service was great and convenient. The seating area could be more ample. But hey, it's winter and coats take up space, dammit. Sure I'll give them that. Take friends and convert them to the saucinator monstro wings that Crisp offers up for about the same price as the other overpriced 'gourmet' crap offered up and down the same street.
