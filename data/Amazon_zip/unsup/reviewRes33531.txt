So 2 stars not for the food, since it was 4 star quality, but for the service. This was my first time here so of course, when I went to pay, I took out my wallet and offered a credit card. Instead of saying "sorry, we don't accept credit cards" or even "cash only," the cashier rudely pointed and tapped loudly on the sign on the register that said cash only. Do you know how to speak? Do words come out of your mouth? RUDE! And what's the deal with not offering tahini sauce on the side? I've been to multiple Middle Eastern restaurants, all which offered tahini sauce, especially if they serve falafels. That really ruined my falafel experience - yes, they were huge and crispy but not complete without my fave sesame sauce. At least my meal wasn't too pricey.
