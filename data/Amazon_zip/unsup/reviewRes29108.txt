The pizza's fine, I guess, although we hardly got to enjoy it because it arrived 40 minutes after we ordered it and had to stuff it down our throats to avoid missing "Inception." The waitress almost acted shocked that we needed our food faster than 40 minutes after we ordered it to make a movie. Uh, you're right across the street from a movie theater!!! Shouldn't the first question be to anyone showing up, "Are you going to see a movie?" It's literally the closest restaurant to Webster movie theater. I can get delivery pizza to me in less than 40 minutes and yet I couldn't get pizza in a restaurant in 40 minutes. I certainly would never go there prior to a movie unless the movie started past 9pm and I was there for lunch.
