I loved the Violet Hour. We went on a Monday night, so it was pretty uncrowded. All the staff was friendly and very patient with us. It took us a while to decide what we wanted. All the drinks were great and the hummus appetizer was fantastic. The menu and vibe reminded me a lot of the Patterson House in Nashville.
