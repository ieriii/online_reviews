Hello, fall. Welcome back after me being all sticky from sweat in my non-AC unit apartment. However, with cold weather, what do I crave? Southern food! Big Jones...definitely bordered on 3-4 stars. I'd give it 3.5 stars if we could have a half system. Basic break down - Long wait, so we were sat at the bar. For 2 entrees, an order of the doughnuts (What are those called again??? They were amazing!!), fried green tomatoes with shrimp, a coffee, an orange juice, a Campari soda, and a 20+% tip...all for $50. Ambiance wasn't so homey and the guy behind the bar was a bit forgetful but was so sweet so it was easy to forgive him. You could tell the servers were a bit overwhelmed bc they were slammed. So after yoga, I just wanted to eat fried food. My fried catfish over grits was absolutely lovely...and the cornbread was fantastic as well. I didn't clean my plate...I could hear my arteries screaming at me. My dish was served with a poached egg on top...not really fan since the yolk broke all over the grits...however, that was my fault since I couldn't decide how to get the egg, so I had the bartender surprise me. Note to self...next time, the fat kid in me wants a fried egg on a separate plate so it doesn't mix with my fried catfish. :) The doughnuts...whatever fancy name they go by...I'm not a foodie, can you tell?...were amazing. No more Dunkin Donuts for me. The fried green tomatoes were great as well...and I couldn't help but think of the movie as I ate. Yes, I am a dork. All in all, everything was fairly good and I felt like everything was worth the price. I will definitely be back. I have been here for dinner before...and I find I definitely prefer their brunch.
