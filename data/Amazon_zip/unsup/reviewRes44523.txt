We came here after having sushi at the horrible place across the street in the hopes that a nicely pulled double espresso would clear our palate. We were absolutely delighted with the offerings. We chose a macaroon each, "raspberry rose" and "coconut lime." The espresso was pulled by hand, and as a former barrista at a hoity-toity espresso house, I could tell the barrista there knew how to steam milk properly, so I'll be back to sample the lattes! The pastries were pure art. My husband and I made a vow to come back and try everything once.  There is an annex to the bakery that you have to go outside to get inside of, which-- even in 6 degree weather, added charm. There was music playing in the background and well-worn eclectic furniture spread over a large, open, high-ceilinged, single room. Photos of their artistic pastries covered the walls.  Clearly a place committed to quality, but without the haughty atmosphere it had the potential to sport. On the eve of the infamous battle between the Bears and the Packers for the Superbowl berth, they had little cookies that had a swiss-cheese pastry cutout pattern with a red "X" through it that said, "Packers stink." So cute!
