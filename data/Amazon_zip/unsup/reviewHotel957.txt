young, modern, centrally located - those three words describe amalfi the best. The staff is quite young and ambitious, spending a comfortable atmosphere. The hotel has bewn built in 2004 and stays modern. The rooms are spacious, the beds, gosh, i wish i never have to leave it - extremly comfortable! And it is very well located. You are in everything's walking distance, north as much as south. Around the corner you fis a couple of nice steak houses, pubs n bars. The breakfast you got on the corridor with more than just the standard continental one. Further, you got free drinks in the late afternoon! I do recommend to stay here (will be #1 choice when i come back to chicago...)
