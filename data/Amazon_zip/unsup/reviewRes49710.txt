While playing tour guide for my Vancouver friends' first visit to Chicago, my friend Sarah requested a girls' night at Bin 36. We enjoyed our wine flight and the cheese flight was great too. Service was excellent, and it was a great place to people watch. So many women had fabulous heels that I felt like we were on the Sex and the City set. I definitely will go back to buy one of the wines I tasted.
