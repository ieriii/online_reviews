I've been to Francesca restaurants a lot, but I'd actually never been to this particular location. I knew I was probably in for something good, but everything was even better that I remembered. The bread is warm and served with basil infused olive oil, so good. We had the calamari to start--and let me say, easily the best calamari that I have ever had. It wasn't heavily breaded and it was full of flavor. It was delcious. I noticed that every table around us was ordering it as well so it must be a favorite there. Although the menu changes from day to day, they always have calamari so I really recommend trying it if you go there. It's the best I've ever had. I got scallops and linguini in a light tomato sauce and it was excellent. I was almost full by the time I got my meal but the scallops were prepared perfectly and I ate what I could. The portions here are HUGE though. I brought home what I had left and it's easily another 2 meals. Everything was delicious though and reasonably priced. I really love this place, it's fantastic.
