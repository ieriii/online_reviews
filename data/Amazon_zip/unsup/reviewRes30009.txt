We have tried the Opart Thai House a couple of times and the last time is truly the Last Time!! In our opinion, the food is not authentic Thai and is very pricey for what you get. There are a few better Thai Restaurants in the neighborhood so save your money and try one of those. One that comes to mind is Spoon Thai. It has a very nice atmosphere and is priced more reasonable and it is just a block away from Opart. However, our favorite is Thai Pastry on Broadway one block south of Argyle Street. Wonderful Thai food and very inexpensive. And it is a BYOB.
