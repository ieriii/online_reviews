Go there for sushi. Go there for a real meal. Go there for service. It's ALL good. Definitely lives up to the hype. The only reason why I didn't give Sunda a four star review is that although the "entrees" were delicious and served in generous portions which I appreciate (there's nothing like going to a fancy restaurant with tiny pretentious portions)... but there was nothing that made them STAND OUT. There was nothing that different about the pad thai which was a little disappointing because this is SUNDA!! All of my friends and I shared sushi and tried each other's dishes... I can verify that everyone had delicious entrees but the sushi rolls were the best part of our meal. Try the Crunchy Pig, Hidden Lobster roll and the Firecracker roll. Uh-mazing. We also had the "Ridiculous" for dessert which was essentially a giant ball of ice cream covered in a caramel shell of some kind. Get it. It was awesome. Expensive meal but totally worth it. If only I had spotted a celebrity... would've given it a 5th star. :)
