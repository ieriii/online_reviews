My favorite pizza in Chicago. I'm a thin crust guy and when I get it from Calo topped with prosciutto and mushrooms it's the closest I've found in Chicago to the outstanding pizzas we had in Rome & Sardinia. I've also had their fried chicken which is delicious and comes at a great price --- $8.95 includes 4 pieces of fried chicken, choice of soup, salad or slaw (great slaw) and pasta or potato. Most of all the fried chicken isn't soggy when it arrives. I've never been disappointed with a delivery order form Calo. Desserts are definite standouts as is the blue cheese gnocchi.
