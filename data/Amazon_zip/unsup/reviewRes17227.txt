I love this place!! I think it's one of the best deocrated restaurants and the food is delicious. My Dad doesn't even like guacamole usually, but he loves the guacomole at Carnivale. They need to work out some kinks with the reservation system. Because somehow, even with a reservation-they make you wait 30 minutes for a table. The food is worth the wait though. Get the pernil!
