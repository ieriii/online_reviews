This place never fails to satisfy. Always good, always plentiful and we always walk out of there stuffed!! Food and service are both excellent. In fact, we were just talking without any server in sight.. I mentioned it would be nice to have a little bbq sauce to try it with the ribs. No sooner did I finish that statement and a server appears at our table and asks if he can bring some bbq sauce. This guy must have just picked up a key word while passing by and was there to grant my wish (I guess I should have said it would be cool to have a Ferrari!!).
