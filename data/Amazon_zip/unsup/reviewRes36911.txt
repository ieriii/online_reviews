boo, disappointed!  doughy/under-cooked pancakes, incorrect orders, and an undercooked $16 omelet. not worth the wait or overpriced hype. even after sending the incorrect omelet back and expressing an unsatisfactory experience, was charged in-full....poor customer service. Will be heading back to Wishbone for their cheese grits! YUM! :)
