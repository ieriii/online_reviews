This place just gets crazier and crazier.  At least they've expanded and now have double the amount of seating than they used to have about 5 years ago. Too bad the parking lot is still the same size - luckily there's residential parking nearby where there are usually plenty of spots. It's probably a better idea to park there anyway, the parking lot is tight and there are some cars that are parked poorly in that lot :) Went on a Saturday night and was able to get a table pretty quickly, but then we were told that the food would take anywhere from 45 minutes to an hour. Fine, we'll just drink until the food comes out! The service here is pretty good considering the ladies are busy running back and forth changing the grills for people who got the barbecue and helping you cook your meat and constantly bringing you more alcohol. They're all business though, so don't expect them to hold your hand while you try to decide what you want. Everything here is pretty good, my personal favorites: - boo dae jun-gol. huge spicy soup meant for at least 2 people that has all sorts of junk: sausage, spam, bacon, meat, ramen noodles and some veggies. Delicious when you're drinking or already drunk. - naeng myun - clear noodles in a cold broth that is great for the summer time. They don't always have this available though. Not entirely sure why? - sam gyub sal with kimchi bokkeum. spicy pork/kimchi stir fry with some plain tofu. YUM.  It's not killer spicy but it's definitely got a kick to it. you will pay for this dish the next day, if you know what I mean.
