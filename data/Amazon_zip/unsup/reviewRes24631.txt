Think of the most romantical place with rich food and you're almost there. I felt like I was on the set of romance novel cover shoot. And not cause my bodice was ripped. But the dim lights, random grape vines strung up, exotic art, guitar player, and curtains around the boothes. It was like Arabian Nights or a Moroccan fantasy...let's rock the Casbah! They focus on the three food groups: cheese, meat, and chocolate. Here's where it gets dicey, guys...you have to cook it yourself. It's more complicated than it looks or you'd think because you have to time it and pay attention and stuff when cooking the raw meat and fish in oil. But if you do it well you can impress your date. Here's another tip, there's a fondue game that if a piece of food falls off your fork into the urn you have to kiss someone. I learned that from a The Babysitters Club Book. The Cheese tasted best with the fruit. The cheese is kinda sharp but very good. The Meat and Seafood was super. The dips really made this course phenomenal. The Chocolate was just ok. I was hoping to end the evening with a bang but it was kinda dark and bitter. They serve wine that pairs well with the food and decent cocktails. I got a hot spiked coffee drink. If you like romance, atmosphere, a different dining experience then this is the place for you. Yup, Geja, heck ya!
