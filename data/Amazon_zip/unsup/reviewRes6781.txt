Sapori Trattoria Sapori Trattoria is located on busy north Halsted St. in the Lincoln Park area and as its name indicates, the cuisine is Italian. The front door opens to a large bar area that leads to two dining rooms, one large and one small, on the first floor. Another large dining room is located on the second floor that includes a service bar. It is nicely decorated and comfortable. On a recent Sunday evening my wife and another couple dined there and arrived shortly before our 6:00 p.m. reservation. The two dining rooms on the first floor were almost filled to capacity. Nevertheless, we were seated in minutes and were lucky to get a table next to a window. A variety of unique cocktails was offered. We all tried one and they were all deemed very good. We started our meal by sharing antipasti consisting of the crostini de avocado and the grilled calamari. Both were fresh and nicely prepared although one of us didn't care for the calamari sauce. Two of us also split the Asparagi salad (asparagus, lemon, olive oil, tomatoes, and Italian goat cheese) that was fresh and very tasty. For our entres we ordered Vitello Portafoglio (rolled veal scaloppini stuffed with cheeses and basil sauted in a veal reduction sauce), Vitello Paesana (veal scaloppini sauted with artichokes and tomatoes in a wine sauce), Fresh Chilean Sea Bass (pan seared in light tomato sauced with oysters and mushrooms), and Risotto Pescatore (sauted arborio rice with mussels, clams, calamari, shrimp, and scallops). Everyone commented that their entres were fresh, well prepared with quality ingredients, and flavorful. For dessert we split one order each of the tiramisu and the panna cotta. Both were unremarkable. Service was professional and fairly attentive.  Sapori Trattoria serves good food using a variety of unique recipes at reasonable prices in an energetic atmosphere. Our overall dining experience was very enjoyable and it is recommended.
