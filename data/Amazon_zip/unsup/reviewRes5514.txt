Beet salad with whipped goat cheese and pistachios? Feta and cucumbers smeared on bread? Octopus grilled to perfection? You can have all these wonderful things and more if you squeeze yourself into Purple Pig and pay too much for super small servings of wine. If those two things did not exist, this place would be four stars, hands down. I have to say a super positive thing about the service: super friendly - not what you would expect from an always jam-packed place.
