Superb...need I say more? For those who have not tried this restaurant, do yourself and your pallet a favor and go here immediately. Don't even save it for a special occasion, just go, have fun and don't worry about the bill at the end of the meal because it'll all be worth it. The flavors go so well together and melt in your mouth. Scallops are phenomenal and the appetizers are unique and tasty. We had the lobster corn dog (how cool is that) and the white tuna sashimi that came w/a passion fruit sauce..ohhh so yummy. I'd go here again in a heartbeat if I had the chance. We were celebrating our anniversary so Graham Elliot signed a menu for us. Great personal touch. We even saw him roaming around the restaurant w/the Operational Manager (his right man). Our waitress told us all about the structure of the place and how Graham Elliot is opening up a sandwich (Grahamwich) place in downtown soon. We'll check that out too once it's here.
