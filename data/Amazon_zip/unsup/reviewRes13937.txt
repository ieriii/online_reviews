Mmmmmmmmm. I am a beer lover and this place totally hits the spot. I'd been forewarned about difficulty finding open seating after a certain point, so I headed on down here mid-afternoon ish on a Friday. After doing a once-over of the room and walking around, i found that every chair and barstool in the place was occupied. No big deal; I figured I could drink my beer at the counter behind the bar and that would be fine, if only slightly awkward since I'd come alone. As I stood at the bar waiting to be helped, the couple next to me (a woman, seated, and her significant other, standing at her side) stood up and turned to me, informing me they were leaving and I could have their seat. Awesome! As for the beer, I don't remember exactly what I ordered, but I told someone working what kinds of beers I like and was brought a pint which I then enjoyed while reading a book. And because (good) beer begs to be paired with food, I ordered the bruschetta appetizer, which is uniquely made and totally delicious. I was going to order a second glass of the beer, when I saw they had Lagunitas Chicago-Style Ale. WHAT?! Here I am, a California native living just down the road from Lagunitas Brewery, a place with which I am incredibly familiar, and I'd never even heard of the beer. Turns out, it's a Chicago specialty, offered only at select bars for a limited time. Obviously, I couldn't resist. Of course, that beer was fantastic as well... Revolution is all about good beer - whether it's their own or good beer made by other microbreweries. Regarding the atmosphere: the patrons didn't strike me as particularly obnoxious or annoying folks, which bar and restaurant combinations have the tendency to attract. There was even a customer who ran after me as I was leaving because I'd left my phone at the bar! The service was on point and the place is done well. Definitely stop here if you're ever visiting!
