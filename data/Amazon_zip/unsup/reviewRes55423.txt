We've been here twice. Once right after they opened and once more first week of January. I really want this place to do well, because this area of Lincoln Park (we live a block away) is not so hot for good restaurants. The Good:The food is imaginative and delicious. I love the limited menu, and minimalist descriptions. The prix-fixe option is my favorite way to eat. Few decisions, and it makes the evening an event. My favorite dish is the octopus, but you will be suprised and pleased with any of the choices. Desserts need a little more thought, but the menu is basically there.The Not-So-Good:$60 without drinks is too high to make this a regular destination. I understand the quality of the food dictates it, but compared with Sweets and Savories' prix-fixe of $29, Sprout will be saved for special occasions. We are also disappointed with the wine selections. The list needs to be fleshed out, especially in the whites. (The coupon we got in the mail for half-off bottles of wine was certainly welcome, and brought us back, so thanks Sprout.)  Service is inconsistent. Our first visit we had a great server, our second we had a stuck-up over-actor. Front of house staff is generally good. I like the classy interior, but as someone else mentioned, the sign on the gate is tacky, and the lighted sign is too far back, hidden behind the neighboring building. And try not to be seated in the back alcove.Overall right now Sprout is a good restaurant, but I think in 6 months or so it will be a great one. And no more excuses, get on OpenTable!Best of luck, Sprout. We're glad you're in the neighborhood.
