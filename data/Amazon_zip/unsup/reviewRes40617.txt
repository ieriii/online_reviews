PHO ME! I'll beg you to. Especially if you Pho me here! The staff is always kind and helpful and the community style table set ups make for an entertaining and pleasant dining experience. The Pho is one of the most delicious things I have ever put in my mouth. Once I start eating, I just can't stop. This Pho seriously has a crack-like addictiveness to it! I high recommend ordering the beef raw and on the side. The broth does a lovely job cooking the meet to a tender perfection this way. Also, don't be shy. Try all of the sauces and delicious toppings. You're in for a grand experience!
