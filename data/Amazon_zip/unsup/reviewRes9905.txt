It's really hard to go against the grain on this one. I want to say I was blown away by Piccolo Sogno and the reality is that if I want to spend that kind of money on Italian food, there are several other options in Chicago that won't disappoint. The menu itself lacks a little pizzazz for me. Of course, I read other people's Yelp reviews before joining my friends for dinner here as I wanted some guidance prior to ordering. There were a number of "special" items that people commented on in their reviews and just my luck, none of them were being featured the night I was there. The wine list is overwhelming and the little direction I received from the server steared me towards one of the more expensive varieties; which if I wasn't sure where to begin that certainly wouldn't have been my starting point but I took the advice I was given and was underwhelmed by the choice. It was rather bland and not very spicy and did not pair well with my bland ravioli with pine nuts in a brown butter sauce. That's right, bland was the word of the night. Portions left me hungry. How's that possible at an Italian restaurant in Chicago?!?! I pretty much devoured half of my friend's margharetia pizza which wasn't at all special. To break it down for you. There were four of us. We each had two glasses of wine, two pizzas, one ravioli, and one spaghetti bolognese. The bill came out to $45 per person. Service was great and the ambiance is delightful. The outside patio looks amazing and in the summer I would maybe go for an app just to check out the patio, but that's about it.
