i love this place. i'm generally not a breakfast person, so i usually get the smoked salmon sandwich with a salad. it's delicious! if you're looking for a nice quiet place, on the weekdays this is your spot. if you're looking for a typical chicago breakfast place that's completely packed and noisy, this is your spot on the weekends. (i avoid 3rd coast on the weekends.)
