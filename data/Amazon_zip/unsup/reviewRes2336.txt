If I was a Death Row Inmate and had a choice of where to eat my last meal, this would be the place. Can happiness be had in tubular meat? Oh yes, it can. You usually have to stand in line for a while, because there are many people who come here to eat their way to hot dog nirvana. But you know what? These are happy people standing in line. And Doug? You are the man. Long may you and your fried in duck fat fries live in infamy.
