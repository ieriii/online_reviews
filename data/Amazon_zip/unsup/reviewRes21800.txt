Recently headed to Chicago and before I left on my trip a friend recommended Superdawg... Not anywhere near where I was headed, we made a pilgrimage of sorts to this Hotdawg Haven. Driving up the block we saw the unique roof ornaments and pulled into the drive-in lot. It was full. An employee came and asked if we wanted to eat in our car or in the dining room and directed to an available parking spot. Arrived prime lunch hour, the place had constant activity and a constant line the entire time I was there, but it moved. First round ordered Superdawg and Strawberry shake (which a local recommended). When my number came up, I was slightly unimpressed the food came in a little takeout box that didn't look like much of anything. Apparently better than good things can come in small packages. Filled with fries, pickle, and Superdawg with hot peppers on top, I dug in. I was back in line for another one before the people in my group were halfway done. A testament to how good it was and that I enjoy eating. The second was as good as the first. I left a very happy and satisfied customer. I would definitely recommend, I will be back. Apparently, there is also a Superdawg in Midway airport as well which I found out about as I my gate was right across from it. Sadly my flight was in the AM and it wasn't open yet. Not a fun morning, 5:40 wake up, then Superdawg taunting me from across the terminal.
