Great place to try beers and high quality food. It can get crowded so have patience on the weekends. Bartenders do not hover over you and they will take time explaining the beers if you ask. Also they have an upstairs that is open most night of the week. We have always had great experiences at Revolution and we hope it becomes a Logan Square institution. Weekend brunch off the menu is good as well.
