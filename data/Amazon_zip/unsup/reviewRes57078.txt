We came on a Sunday afternoon. Not too crowded, we sat at the bar ordered apps and the home brews. Food was good, fresh, well above average. The beers were fantastic. We each had 2 pints, and then brought home a growler of Eugene Porter to share with friends.Service- top notch. All of the gals that worked behind the bar were on top of it, and friendly.This was a perfect afternoon treat. We will be back.
