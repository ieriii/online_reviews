I never write reviews but my horrible experience at this place brought me here. To start off the over eager waiter literally read the entire menu to us, which took over 15 minutes. I'm pretty sure last time I checked we were all very capable of reading on our own. Specials would have been just fine. Then when we needed a minute to look at the menu and actually read it for ourselves he came back 20 seconds later twice to ask if we needed a minute. If he hadn't read the menu to us we would have been ordered and had our food already. Then when it came to get the check and get out of there so we could make the show we were going to see he was no where in site. To make things worse my girlfriend became extremely sick not long after eating there. At first we didn't think there was anyway that it was related to the food there because we had shared the empanada sampler and calamari since we weren't extremely hungry. We figured out later that she had ate beef and chicken empanadas when I had ate only cheese ones. She was sick for two days after that. By the way, my empanadas were nothing more than fried mozzarella or some cheese similar. She said hers' were better though she definitely paid for it over the next two days.To be fair the other two people we were with did like their food. However, I would never recommend this place!
