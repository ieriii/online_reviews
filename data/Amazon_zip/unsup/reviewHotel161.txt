Everytime my parents come to town they stay at The Whitehall due to a friend's discount. We love it there. Its downtown in the mix but its not too touristy and its not too crowded. Great customer service and great rooms. I love going to the bar for a quick cocktail before heading out to dinner. The beds are super comfortable. The Whitehall is just fabulous!
