Great Business Trip to Avenue Hotel, ChicagoThe Avenue Hotel is a great business hotel with an unbeatable location and great amenities. The rooms were top-notch and everything about my visit went smoothly. The hotel is a short walk to the Magnificent Mile and all the shops and restaurants you could want. If not for my business trip and more personal time was available it would have been ideal. I must make a point of making it back here for a more relaxing trip in the near future.My room was clean, comfortable and had a great view.  The amenities were great and the bed was unbelieveable. I don't remember ever having such a good night's sleep in a hotel much less on a business trip. The staff at the Avenue hotel were wonderful. From the front desk staff to the bellmen, guest services and housekeeping, the entire crew went out of their way to assist with plans both inside and outside of the hotel, and the hotel bar and its wait staff are experts at serving business groups -- attentive but not overbearing.In general, my stay at the Avenue Hotel was exceptionally smooth and productive. Our business meetings went smoothly, the rooms themselves were comfortable and had all the up to date equipment for presentations. I would recommend this hotel to any business group, but also to any tourist looking for a hotel convenient to many popular downtown Chicago spots!
