This is the most upscale feeling BYOB sushi bar I've been to in the city -- a little better ambiance than your favorite neighborhood hole in the wall, but prices that don't reflect it. The menu is huge and includes an impressive sashimi list and tons of rolls, ranging from your old favorites to Coast's signatures. Highlights from our dinner included the hamachi with jalapeno, the sunrise and the white dragon. I have a weird mayo thing and there was no judgment or backlash for taking the white stuff out, which I very much appreciate. I didn't realize it at the time, but this place also has a max liters for BYOB (bottle of wine/6 beers per 2 people), however it was not enforced. Coast is busy and tables fill up fast, so if you end up staying a little long finishing up your contraband booze, be sure to make it up to your server with a healthy tip. They take reservations, but reserve half of the restaurant for walk-ins. We came in around 6:30 pm on Saturday night to beat the rush and had no problem getting a table. By 7:30, it was packed.
