Had a reservation for 8:45, they said they couldn't seat us earlier even though there were tables open (that remained open), so we sat in the Tavern, which may be the reason why our service wasn't great. However, the way the menu set up is really fun. You can select a flight of wine and a flight of cheese and you can substitute as many as you want. Which is awesome. It's super customizable to your taste.  I would go back, but only because the gimmick behind the wine and cheese is fun.
