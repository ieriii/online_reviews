This place was pretty good. They have a ton of stuff on the menu. We ate there and I had a slice of the mushroom onion and spinach deep dish which for 2.75 was pretty good. My friend had the Lasagna. It was a lot of food for 5.25! Big piece of lasagna and salad and soup and bread... Anyway, it's a good place, but I don't agree with the best deep dish in Chicago. I'd pick Gino's East for that (I love the cornmeal crust).
