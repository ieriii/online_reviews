I never write reviews on Yelp. But Lockdown deserves my review. I'm not a metal fan. I'm not a fan of super loud music in a bar either. But I am a fan of burgers, and Lockdown has the best for the area. Hands. Down. The burgers are outstanding. The fries are delicious and their aioli is a wonderful addition to the plate. Good beer, friendly staff, you can't go wrong. I've gotten into countless arguments about Kumas vs. Lockdown. Does Kumas have a half priced burger night? Of course not. Does Lockdown make you wait 2+ hours for a table? Nope. Come here. You won't be disappointed in the food.
