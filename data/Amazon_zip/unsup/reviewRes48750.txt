so... I called on a Saturday to make a reso for Sunday Brunch... unfortunately, I was too late... Booked!... we really wanted to try it anyway... we had a VERY comfortable 45 minute wait... the room was buzzing... even though the staff was incredibly busy, there was no lack of genuine smiles and eye contact... seated and greeted immediately... excellent food, even for the surprise guest who was vegetarian... I would have never brought him here had I known, but he still had a pleasant time... great energy... clever restrooms... a great experience all around...
