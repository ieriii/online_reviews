Best freaking bloody marys in town. I should really call it a shrimp cocktail with a side of bloody mary though. Excellent breakfast and lunch food. Still can't wait to come here for dinner and enjoy one of the all you can eat crab legs or shrimp deals. I've only been here twice and the host remembered me on my second visit which was a nice touch and the servers are all very friendly. By far my favorite brunch place on the north side.
