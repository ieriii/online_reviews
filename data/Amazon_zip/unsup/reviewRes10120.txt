Rating Piccolo Sogno's indoor and outdoor dining areas simultaneously is a big misunderstanding. Could they be any MORE different from one another? The outdoor dining area is too dreamy. It reminds me of home... Europe. A big, beautiful tree is the centerpiece of the spacious patio. The exposed brick wall complements the natural color palette. Little lights are placed tastefully throughout this green space. Ivy crawls on the wooden fence. A true escape from urban madness. A place to rest the senses... Oh and did I mention that the food is great? The indoor dining area on the other hand is a rude awakening. So disappointing. A complete departure from the magical, romantic, natural environment of the patio. The color selection, light fixtures, seating arrangement, modern and rather cold furniture, new bar and awkward bar dining area... why? why? why? Piccolo Sogno: You're hurting my soul! I know that this is a restaurant, and maybe it would be better for me to focus on the food (which was delicious by the way) - but after eating here 3 times... this is the thought that resonates most. ps. My family threw our post nup party here in August for a little over 100 guests, and we worked with the owners and staff here closely to make sure everything was perfect. We had food and drink stations. Chef Tony Priolo and the restaurant's manager were both there throughout the night to make sure everything went smoothly. And it did! I have to say that we were more than pleased with the customer care, input, and service - The staff was always present and attentive, but subtle enough that we felt we created a very intimate atmosphere. I highly recommend Piccolo Sogno for private events. If I had gotten married in Chicago, I would have probably chosen this outdoor venue for our small reception. Very romantic!
