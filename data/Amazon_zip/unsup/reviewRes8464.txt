Hands-down the best pizza in Chicago. Every part of their menu is delicious, except perhaps the appetizers. We've often found the appetizers (particularly the specials) to fall flat. The owner is great and gives you cannoli as you leave. Sometimes, when you're waiting, he'll also give you a complementary glass of prosecco. Must trys: Bufalina pizza and the Nutella dessert.
