This is the best place ever for pho. Plenty supportive of large groups - you'll be able to nab a big round table (and likely fill the whole thing), and that will make for an excellent evening. Be prepared to wait for a few, in a pretty crowded line area, but come hungry because the apps are just as good as the pho and the bowls are HUGE and filling. Great service. I especially love all the fixin's and condiments available for your customization. Go easy on the spice at first.. those jalapeos get hotter as they steep.
