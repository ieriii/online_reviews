I said it a few times already, and I will say it again: when you have a Yanyao in your life, life is good. And you won't ever go starving. Ms Nom-Nom had promised me a duck way back in the Spring to celebrate my birthday. She stayed true to her word. Back from her foodie marathon across the country in lovely San Francisco where she admittedly left her heart like all of us (and probably our flat stomachs and overall good figures too), she called Sun Wah, reserved a duck (poor little thing) and soon enough we were on our way in the first cool day of the summer to indulge. Tip #1: if you are not a fan of crowds and are brave enough to have dinner at 4pm - this is definitely the time to go. The place was EMPTY. We perused the huge, double-sided menu, just for fun and decided to add to our order bbq pork and water spinach (so.....kinda like broccoli rabe but thinner and the stem has a hole in the middle. Delicious). What can I add to all that has been said already?!?!? This Peking/Beijing duck is just ridiculously good. Carved table side, it is a marvel with the warm, sticky buns, the julienned carrots and green onions, the pickled daikon and the hoisin sauce. And don't skip on the crispy skin. This is the BEST PART BY FAR. So effing good. Tip #2: ask for the noodles instead of the fried rice, and stay firm about it. Served with duck meat, carrots, pea pods, mushrooms and onions it is out of this world. And dudes, don't let the service bother you. Your waiter/waitress may not speak perfect English, he/she may be slow and not overtly nice but seriously who cares?!? You are not coming for the service but the food. Eat and be happy. Tip #3: try to have a Yanyao in your life. There is nothing better. Word. Tip #4: I am now dying to feast on black bean oysters and frog legs. If you feel in a philanthropic mood, call me.
