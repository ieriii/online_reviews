Delicious southern BBQ food, southern BBQ atmosphere and southern friendly service! The atmosphere really does bring you "home" with the wooden accents on everything and the red and white plaid uniforms of the servers. It is quite large with an upstairs and downstairs. Restaurant seating is throughout but there are a couple of lounges with TVs to comfortable watch game, get appetizers and drink at. The food is definitely going to meet your craving of "Mom's southern meals!" The BBQ Appetizer flight was a perfect meal for me with a taste of each of their meats and a large cut of their cheddar corn bread! The people around me expressed their love just about everything else on the menu too! Be sure to come hungry so you can have enough of your meal and still have room for dessert. We loved their blueberry bit and the cookies! Ill be back soon Q!
