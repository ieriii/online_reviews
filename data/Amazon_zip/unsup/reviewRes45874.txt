The Grand Lux has a great location on Michigan Ave and also creates a great atmosphere inside the restaurant. Being on the second floor gives you a great view of Michigan Ave. They have very good food for being a chain, huge portions, and reasonable prices on entrees. The only thing stopping this from being five stars is: -I was told it'd be a 5-10 minute wait and it turned out being close to 30 -The lighting was a little to dark for my liking -All desserts are $8! (I really wanted to try one but asking that much from a college student for a dessert is a little much, especially with that Chicago tax rate). Back to the positive, the spicy chicken flat bread that i ordered was delicious, and honestly could have passed at 2 whole sandwiches (that's how big the portion was). I also had the buffalo bites as an appetizer and they were very good as well, kind of like mini crab cakes except with buffalo chicken instead of crab. I would definitely recommend the Grand Lux Cafe, just be cautious about when you go because you are bound to have a long wait if you go at prime dinner hours.
