I'm writing this less than 10 minutes after returning from there, while eating my baklava roll to go. This is place phenomenal, I just wish I didn't have to rush through it on my 30 minute lunch break and that I had a dining companion with whom I could have "mmmm"ed and "aaaaah"ed with. To start I had the mushroom and emmenthal cheese artopita (essentially a savory croissant filled with all sorts of flavorful rich yummy nom nom goodness) with the potato salad. Pretty sure the potato salad is not made with mayo but rather some type of yogurt (Greek?). Makes it much lighter. Then I ordered a side of pita bread, which they grilled, and a side of tzatziki sauce. The tzatziki was served in three huge balls topped with olive oil and kalamata olives. Talk about presentation! The entire thing was incredible, though the potato salad couldn't compete with the artopita and the tzatziki. As I was leaving I couldn't help but stop at the bakery case and low behold, had to buy a baklava. I went with the walnut baklava roll because (sadly) all I had left on me was $3 in change and the regular baklava would have been close to $4 with tax. At first I thought this was a little steep given the size but then I tasted this moist, sweet, honey covered little nugget of heaven and quickly forgot about my cheap Jewish ancestry. Will be back probably once a week for lunch since it's a block away. Also, their cocktail list looked amazing and at only $7 for a martini or a mojito I could see myself coming here for happy hour or dinner.
