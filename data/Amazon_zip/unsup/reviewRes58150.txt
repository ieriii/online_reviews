I had a great dinning experience here. I went here with my husband, since we couldn't decide what to order we settled on the chef's selection. Every course was absolutely delicious. I would say the place was about 50% full that night. Our server was very attentive and knowledgeable. The only downside is that it is quite pricey. I can't wait to go back!
