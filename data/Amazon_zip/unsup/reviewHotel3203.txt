My girlfriend and I stayed here over the weekend. The room was booked through priceline. While the hotel did have its high points (very comfy bed, nice TV, beautiful lobby, great views) the bad outweighed the good. First off, someone made a terrible decision when designing the bathroom. There's a wood slated window that opens from the bathroom into the rest of the room. The door of the bathroom is also wood slated and it slides open and shut. There is no over-head fan. So what happens in the bathroom is essentially public knowledge to everyone else in the room. Also, the walls are paper thin. We could hear everything (and I really do mean everything) in the neighboring room. While this is expected to a certain degree, it was a little too intimate for a four star hotel. The W really does try to squeeze every dime out of you they can. Even the cheapest of hotel chains offer free wi-fi in their rooms. Why the W charges is beyond me. Lastly, the W Lakeshore attracts a more boisterous crowd than I would have anticipated. People literally yelling in the hallways at 3am. Bottom line --- while we still had a good time, the next time we're looking for a nice place to stay in the city, we'll be avoiding the W Lakeshore.
