Brunched and watched the air show from the outdoor patio. The pat is where it's at, since the indoor area is pretty dark and uninviting. I had the shrimp bahn mi and a few Jameson Ginger Fizzes. Both were delightful. The bahn was served cold and the sauce had a nice bite to it. $13-ish, I think? The Jamies were $8. So not cheap eats but sometimes you just want to get your day drink on whilst hashing out relationship problems with your best dude friend at a hip, urban oasis. Check and mate.
