OMG Delish. the eggs benedict is fantastic, there's a few options to choose from, idk how anyone could be disappointed with that plate. All of the other dishes that came out look great too! The drinks are for the lazy or recovery mornings.  The food is what stands out, but its really kind of amazing that anything stands out. The employees seem engaged and like working there. The food came out ridiculously fast even though they had a 40 minute wait. The decor is simply elegant, unique and tasteful. There's a reason so many people go here. Go.
