I wish I had a neighborhood spot like this!  Super friendly staff, great food, comfortable location, and a great wine list and full bar! I've only been in for breakfast and drinks, and I look forward to coming back many times! Definitely so much more than a cafe - a bistro that feels like home! The breakfast sandwich is great - will fill you for the day, and you may not even need dinner. Must have this with the thick cut bacon - perfectly crisped!
