My little brother was visiting from Florida, and being the good sister I am, I took him to Fogo de Chao because he had never been to a brazilian steakhouse. I had dined here numerous times before and was never a huge fan. But, after dining here with my little brother I love Fogo de Chao! First of all, my brother loved the place and had a wonderful time. Secondly, the service was unbelievable. It all started when we ordered wine. After about 15 minutes we still had not received our bottle, so I simply mentioned to one of the servers that we had not yet received our wine. They were so apologetic...the manager kept coming to our table throughout the night, making sure we were having a good time, our waiter kept checking up on us, etc...And, when we finished eating they sent us free dessert...flan, which was actually quite tasty! All in all, they definitely made up for the 15 minute wait for a bottle of wine, which really was not that big of a deal in the first place. And, the meat was really yummy! I will definitely visit Fogo de Chao again after this experience. Out of the 3 brazilian churrascarias in the city, Fogo is definitely the best!
