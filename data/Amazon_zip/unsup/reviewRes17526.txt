When you walk up to the place, it doesn't look like much. My boyfriend and I stood in like for about 45 minutes on Valentine's Day among many other couples. But when you walk it, it's a completely different story. Everything on the menu is thoughtful with a touch of "old school". It's a little pricey ($14 for a cocktail), but worth it for a special occasion. The music isn't overpowering, and since everyone has a seat, it makes conversation so much nicer. Great place to go with a significant other or close friends to catch up.
