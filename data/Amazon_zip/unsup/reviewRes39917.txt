The food was decent, but EXTREMELY overpriced. The portions were so tiny that even after ordering 5 small dishes, a salad, and two dinner entrees for a woman not even 5' and an average gentleman, we were still ready to go out for dinner...again. We weren't the only ones because I saw other couples finishing their dates meals-probably because their date was being polite by not finishing her meager portions. The worst part of the whole night was the atrocious service by the wait staff. Three service was so bad I will never go to this restaurant ever again. The waitress said 2 sentences to us the entire evening. "Have you dinged with us before?" Reply: No. "Do you have any questions on the food items?" Reply: No. (we have never been here. Why don't you tell us something about the place!). She walks away. She does not say another word to us all night. I felt more comfortable in County Lock-up, not that I have ever been a resident there before, but I have visited. After not once being if I wanted another drink, she comes by and sets the dessert menus on the table and walks away. I loudly tell her, No dessert, just the check! I could not wait to get out if that dump. After waiting more than an hour after being told 45 minutes, the service could have at least not sucked. The crowd looked like pretentious hipsters and yuppies. Not what I was expecting from Logan Square. More caucasians giving a fellow Caucasian a bad rap. Avoid this pretentious, overpriced, trendy dump with horrible service.
