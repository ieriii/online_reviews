Sultan's definately has some of the best falafel around - made even better by the fact that it's cheap and they deliver! one sandwich (which is stuffed with hummus, jeruselem salad, and your call on the spicy sauce, all for $3!) is enough to fill you up without making you feel weighed down. my other favorites are the spinach and meat pies and zatter bread. yum!!
