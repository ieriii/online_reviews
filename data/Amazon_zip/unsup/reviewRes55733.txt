Sabatino's is hands-down one of my very favorite restaurants. Great ambience, fantastic waitstaff, very fairly-priced food that has few if any equals (quality-wise) that I know of. The soups are wonderful--the spinach stracciatella is a favorite of mine. The side dish of pasta that accompanies all entrees is a real standout--because of the delicious homemade gravy/sauce--you will savor every bite. The veal braciole is amazing and is absolutely one of my favorite things on the menu.Sabatino's is a fantastic restaurant --I have never been disappointed by ANYTHING I have ordered there; the portion sizes and courses provided for the prices they charge are a great value and well worth every penny. For great, traditional Italian food, Sabatino's is the place.
