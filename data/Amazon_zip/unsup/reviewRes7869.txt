This place is worth checking out if you have some cash to burn... Moreover, As a result of their all-you-can-east serving system, be prepared to be taken out of the place in a wheel barrow. The Meats: Very good, though some are much better than others. The sausages are quite good, tasty spice combinations matched with a nice charred outside. As far as the steaks go, I prefer the Filet Mignon since that was the only steak they could actually cook properly, i.e. something less than medium (I take my steaks medium rare). Surprisingly, the meats are not what make this place worthwhile. The Cold Bar: Now this was amazing. I have never been as impressed by a cold buffet before I came here. The array of cheeses and cold cuts are impressive and the salads (pasta, chicken, etc) were excellent. I told myself I'll come back here for that and that alone, it was that good. This place gets 4 stars only because of the cost. In my opinion it's not worth what you get, though what you get is certainly good.
