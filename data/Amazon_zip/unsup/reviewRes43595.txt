I love this place. I love the people that work here. The menu is small but everything is delicious. My favorite breakfast item is the salmon bagel its glorious. For lunch I like the avocado sandwich, if you are a pickle their pickles are just right. So here's how it works follow the signs if you want you food to go get in that line. If you're going to stay get in that line. After you order you'll grab your utensils and napkins. Also there is water and glasses towards the back of the restaurant. It gets pretty packed on the weekends and I get annoyed with people that don't know the system but I'm working on that.
