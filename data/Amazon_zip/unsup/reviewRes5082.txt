I really thought I would like this place better, honestly. The wait was long even early on a Tuesday night, but I guess with a small dining room that's to be expected. Everything was delicious and I honestly have no complaint with any of the actual food preparations or flavors. If I could make some suggestions they would be: - add 20% to the prices and give just a little more food with some dishes. The chorizo olives and prosciutto bread balls were great, but only 6 of the former and 5 of the latter is kind of a little weird for a table of 4. - make it clearer which items on the menu are suited to feed more people, like the pork shoulder blade stake, which was phenomenal, tender, and huge, well worth $14. The milk-braised pork shoulder was also lick-my-plate good but I could tell the whole table was disappointed that it was basically the size of a juice box. - make items more easily shareable. The jamon serrano with egg and mushrooms on one single toast was really a little inexcusably awkward. Two smaller toasts would have been way easier to eat. Overall I'd say it was a very delicious, but especially not knowing really what would be enough food I feel like this is only a good place if you're coming with one other person or on a date. I think it was fun to try, but I just frankly don't feel compelled to come back.
