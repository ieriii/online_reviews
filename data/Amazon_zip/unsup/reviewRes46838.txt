A brunch place must do well in all categories (eggs, French toast, etc) to get an overall good rating. Uncommon Ground did well in the French toast category but disappointed in the egg scrambler and other categories. The challah french toast (apple jam, toasted macadamia nuts, ginger and cinnamon whipped honey butter, maple syrup) was delicious. The chilaquiles (eggs, chorizo, tortilla chips, chihuahua cheese & sour cream) were a bit soggy and lacked flavor. The scrambler was also a bit disappointing. The crispy potato latkes were fantastic.    Bloody Mary was great--garnished with celery, a pickle, and an olive. Coffee was nice and strong. Service was attentive and professional. I've only been to this location and it's nice and spacious. They have a parking lot out in back.
