I love this place. I'm trying to eat a vegan diet and this place has all the best food. A Taco Salad sounds like it would be easy to make, but this diner makes it the best! The deserts are pretty good and the vegan shakes are rich and yummy. I highly recommend this place for great vegan food. The vegan cheese they use is one of the best vegan options I've ever found!
