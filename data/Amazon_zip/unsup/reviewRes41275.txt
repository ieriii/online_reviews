Their Pho is very very good and I wish I only had their Pho and I would probably give Tank Noodle 5 stars but I also had their spring rolls and let me tell you that is the most disgusting thing that was ever presented to me on a plate. The clear transparent membrane is so not appetizing to me it is like eating a growing cocoon or placenta. I was brave that day and I also tried their pennyworth shake that was good but still I can't get over that clear transparent membrane.
