We were in from out of town & staying at the Blackstone so the Mercat was the obvious place for drinks before going out on several occasions. The bartenders were the friendliest in town, literally the nicest people we met while on vacation. They have some fantastic specialty drinks and I fell in love with the sangria (AND it's less than $2 a glass on Monday nights)! Unfortunately we did not eat during our stay so I can only comment on the drinks; however, the food did smell amazing!
