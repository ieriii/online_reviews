I booked a double bed room for one night, cost me $241.19, $209.00 plus $32.19 tax. It did not look like on the picture whatsoever. Furniture looked like it was beaten many times by some angry customers. The air in the room was very hot, and there was no any thermostat in the room to change the temperature. For valet parking they charge $33.00 if you roll the car to the front, if you bring it to the garage yourself it cost $28.00, and guess what, guys, to use an Internet will cost you $9.95. We checked in at 3pm, left the room at 6pm, came back after dinner,around 9pm, no one came to check up on room and refresh it. Next time I would stay somewhere else.
