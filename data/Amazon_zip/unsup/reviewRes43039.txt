Really High End place..Definitely another "Hidden Gem" in the City located literally right next to the Merchandise Mart. Large place, very well laid out/dark/small bar in front/patio outside on corner. They make GREAT drinks- I watched these two bartenders (Jimmy/Zack) make some of the best drinks I've seen next to the Violet Hour! At least 3-5 minutes per specialty drink...Good Beer List as well as wine list with some really obscure liquors behind the bar. The food is excellent as well and so are the deserts, The Bread Pudding is a "Must Try"! Starts to fill up about 5:30 and there is a really cool little "Private Party Room" in the basement that they open up about 8PM--another "Must See"...One more finishing touch was the C.O Bigelow soap/lotion in the bathrooms! Nice Job! GTFJD
