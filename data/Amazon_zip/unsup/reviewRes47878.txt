I simply cannot imagine a better dining experience than my wife and I had tonight at ZED451! We found it by accident after having a great burger across the street the night before. Our waitress, Liz, was perfectly attentive and charming. My wife and I totally loved everything we tried. The salad bar or harvest table was imaginative and delicious. Ok, the green beans were a little spicier than I expected but the roasted pineapple more than made up for it. Imagine a huge salad bar where everything is delicious but wait, there's more. There are soups, imported cold cuts and wonderful cheeses. The main course - the meat - was wonderful. We had beef prepared several ways, Moroccan chicken which was AMAZING, lamb, duck, venison, and more, all of which was cooked to perfection. And a bottle of Malbec to add to the enjoyment. As I said before, it was a perfect evening of fantastic food and service. Truly deserving of 5 stars.
