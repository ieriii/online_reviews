Went for a delicious lunch date. We both ordered the Catalan Express: * cheese plate with two mild/nutty hard cheeses really well paired with a sweet sauce and a chutney, green apple slices, and bread * a super hearty saffron rice stew with chicken, sausage, and shrimp * diver scallops, which were super buttery and perfectly cooked * black angus hangar steak -- amazinggg, with a crunchy sear on the outside and tender and moist on the inside We also got a side order of wild mushrooms, which were drenched in garlic and butter and reminded me of escargot. Given our menu choices, we really didn't need the mushrooms -- we were stuffed! And thus, no dessert either. The ambience was wonderful: huge windows with lots of light and views out to Grant Park, an open kitchen in the back (but no unwanted aromas of cooking!), colorful, modern decor, and attentive service. I was impressed that they didn't feel the need to play up Iron Chef linkage at all; the food spoke for itself!
