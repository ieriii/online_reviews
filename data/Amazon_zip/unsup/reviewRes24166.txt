This is a 4.5 star place for me. Food is unique and delicious, also cheap. Meats, fish (tilapia), rice & beans, plantains, oatmeal shakes...all worth going back for. Service is direct and friendly. BYOB is nice b/c saves $ as long as you plan ahead. Plus the cool wine store across the street (Red & White) sells Costa Rican beer (Imperial) which is a good fit for all of the food I've tried there. Their mark-up on Imperial is pretty ridiculous, but that's not Irazu's fault. Some call this a 'burrito' joint but to me it's not - it's different and better.
