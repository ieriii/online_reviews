Kind of weird interior. Almost reminded me of a funhouse, all the uneven floors and stuff. My room was tricky to get to but huge when I got there. The light switches and some of the fixtures could be updated to be a little more useful but the bed was comfortable and the bathroom was classy. I was here for a roller derby tournament and I am not quite sure that they were ready to be invaded by that. But to their credit, they did quite well at managing both a formal wedding and a large gang of after-party attendees waiting for their party to start. Parking sucks. 30 bucks a day to park yourself, 50 to have them park it. I wish I had parked somewhere else and taken the train in, every line stops right near there since it is in the loop.
