This Korean restaurant manger doesn't know how to say Sorry when I found out the part of scoring pad in the steamed rice. It was 2inches big. I can not understand how it will happen. I don't know what's going on in the kitchen.Although they finally said sorry, what they were talking about was they will reduce the tax from the whole price of the food we ate for the apology. I never seen this kinda rude and hateful restaurant.
