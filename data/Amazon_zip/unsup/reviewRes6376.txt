Davanti Enoteca is the new buzz in Little Italy. Like other Scott Harris restaurants, this place doesn't take reservations. But I can assure you that the food is worth the wait. The vasi of ricotta and honey comb was genius. The honey comb added a delightful sweetness that enhanced the already-smooth ricotta. This was very satisfying. Polenta with pig shoulder ragu was served table-side. The polenta was a bit finer than my liking (I prefer my polenta to be more coarsely ground), but the pig shoulder ragu was superb - perfectly tender with rich flavors. The pizza della terra had great flavors from the leek and mushroom. The truffle taste was too subtle for me, and the dough of the pizza was a tad too dense (more like a New York style pizza than Italian pizza) - still good thoguh. Better was the linguine with sea urchin and crab. The pasta was cooked perfectly al dente (best I've had in the US!). The crab was executed nicely, and the sea urchin sauce that coated the linguine had a delectable well-balanced umami. What a great dish!  I will come back for this dish alone.  We got a quartino of 2009 Terredora di Paolo Falanghina. It was fruit-forward, but also had a subtle sweetness. It went perfectly with both the rich polenta and the seafood-based pasta. Very short, affordable, yet balanced wine list. Perfect for a neighborhood enoteca.  Service was friendly and efficient. Decor was rustic yet dramatic - the dining room was surrounded by exposed brick wall, which also acted as wine cellars. Transcending. Spot on.  I was afraid that I wasn't going to like this place because I wasn't a huge fan of Purple Pig. But Davanti Enoteca was just perfect. It's an excellent addition to the neighborhood - rustic, flavorful, and affordable. Bravo!
