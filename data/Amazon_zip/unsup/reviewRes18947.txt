I'd been here before a couple of times and enjoyed it enough to schedule a birthday outing for a large party of friends. There was a misunderstanding about the reservation which they attempted to work out when we arrived. However, the hostess was extremely rude when one of us pulled a chair up to the table for a friend, she walked up, grabbed the chair and in a really nasty tone said "Apparently you aren't COMPREHENDING that you can't put this chair here!". Seems like there could've been a better way to word that. Maybe if she'd have reacted differently they wouldn't have seen a 16-top walk out the door en-masse. Way to blow a nice tip for your server! If you can't handle the pressure of hosting a busy restaurant, maybe you're in the wrong business? That said, the waiter was really apologetic and we felt bad for him. He seemed like a nice dude.
