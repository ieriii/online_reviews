Duck duck and more duck, that's what you get at Sun Wah. This was my first time here since they moved it from the old place around the corner. It's so much bigger now and the interior looks like the interior of a boat complete with motor boat style fans. We did the 3 course, or was it 4 course?, duck meal where they bring you dish after dish of duck infused food then top it off with the main dish which is a whole roasted Duck that they slice up for you at the table. Out of all the courses I especially like the duck with noodles as I could not get enough of it. If you want Duck overload then Sun Wah is the place for you. I'll probably go back to try out their other non Duck food stuffs.
