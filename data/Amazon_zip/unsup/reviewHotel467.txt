Nice hotel with big comfortable rooms. Parking is really expensive (~$44 per day to self-park w/o in-and-out priv., ~$53 to valet w/in-and-out priv.), but not out of the ordinary for the area. The hotel begins on the 5th floor of the building, where the Sky Lobby is located. Rooms go up onto the higher floors from there. So, from the street, you should expect 2 elevator rides and a walk across the Sky Lobby no matter where your room is. The location is very good, near the river, Navy Pier, the Magnificent Mile, Lake Shore Drive, Tribune Tower, NBC Tower, and the Chicago Loop. They are well within walking distance to most of those places and plenty to do (plus, plenty of places to eat). I did not take advantage of the bar, the manager's reception, or the breakfast. However, the breakfast did look pretty busy, so keep that in mind as you read other reviews mentioning it. My only real complaint about the hotel is their keys. If you insert and remove the key too fast or too slow, it won't work. It's hard to gauge exactly how to do it right, consistently. I heard others complain about this, too, on the elevator. After a long day, when you're really tired, the last thing you want to have to do is fight with your room key.  Other than that, highly recommended.
