YUMMY! I love this place. My friend and I went after an emotionally exhausting day and it hit the spot. The waitress was friendly and the food was sooo good. I got the salmon cakes with mac and cheese and home fries The sides were soo good I forgot about the Salmon cakes... before I knew it all of my mac was gone. The salmon cakes were very good with just the right amount of rich cream sauce under them. Also good was the cucumber lemonade so fresh and sweet it was the perfect combo! all and all I am a huge fan of this cute healthy-like dinner.
