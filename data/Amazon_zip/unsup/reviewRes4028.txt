I have never, ever, EVER, had food that has been prepared with the care and precision that I have experienced at Schwa. While I was initially intimidated, the entire staff was nothing but warm and inviting. From beginning to end my palate was teased, tempted and ultimately satisfied with the amazing array of flavors that were presented to me.  I've never been a tremendous fan of organ meats, but if they're prepared like they were at Schwa, I'm down with the offal. Veal heart wrapped with the most delicate tagliatelle with a beautiful nugget of talleggio. OMG frickin' sweet. I could probably go on and on about all the different courses, but you must go and experience it for yourself, I can't imagine anyone being disappointed.
