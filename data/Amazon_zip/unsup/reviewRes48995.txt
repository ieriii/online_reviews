I simply could not wait to try this place. I am in love with Avec and Blackbird, and thought it would also be amazing.. First off, I am not opposed to communal seating, but this was not quite right.. Something about a 280lb man squeezed right next to me eating bone marrow sort of ruined my appetite.  The food was good. We had octopus, and a trio of hams which were both good, but not something that you would come back for. We also split the steak tartare which I really didn't like at all. I think that it is worth a try, but for me, it will probably not be a main stay. It didn't seem to have a nice balance of choices, or maybe everything was just a little too heavy.  The service left a lot to be desired. My glass of wine and water were both empty for a very long time before our waiter made it back to ask me if I would like anything else..  All in all.. worth a try, but I wouldn't race to get there..
