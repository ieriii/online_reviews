I will never be cool enough for this place. I could show up, dressed like Evel Knievel, riding a tyrannosaurus, and exchanging high-fives with Elvis, Jimmy Hoffa, AND Kurt Cobain, and I'd still be only about 1/100th as cool as is required to go here. Not that this stops me from going there and standing in line awkwardly in my non-skinny jeans and button-down shirt, the standard office geek chic of the 30-somethings. The uber-cool guys behind the counter ask for my order, and don't even scorn me for CLEARLY not being awesome enough to be here (utter lack of sarcasm actually, they're super, super nice). My usual(s) are either a kefta kebab sandwich or a lamb shawarma sandwich, both spicy. Occasionally I get a meat pie, or some zatar bread, possibly even some lentil soup. The kebab and well-spiced and tender. The shawarma is delicious with it's roasty goodness. And the lentil soup. Get it with some onions and lemon slices and it'll make you call your mother and demand to know why she served you that Campbell's crap all these years. By all means, go here, order things, enjoy them. It's a not-so-hidden gem. Oh, and put something in the tip jar. Let's not be jerks now.
