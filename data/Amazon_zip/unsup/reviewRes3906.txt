We love Korean chicken wings and decided to try this place out due to the great reviews. Our chicken was good but not as good as the authentic Korean chicken. It was definitely tasty but I think my expectations were just high because of the amazing chicken I have had at Korean restaurants such as Great Seas. I would definitely try this again if I am in the mood and don't fell like treking to albany park to get the wings from Great Seas.
