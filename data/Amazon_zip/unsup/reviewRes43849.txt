there's not much better than steamed cider on a cold rainy day. thankfully we walked into the cozy milk & honey to soothe than craving. i had ham (an absurd amount of ham) and guierre on pretzel loaf which was definitely big enough to share. it was decent, but nothing i would order again. however, the homemade chips it came with i did not especially care for...and for me to say that about chips, they couldnt have been very good. but they had a cozy fire and didnt mind us girls sitting around chatting for a couple hours. the staff was friendly and helpful and the menu was on chalkboards. a lovely touch. it was cute. i might go back. but i wont be heading west just for a milk & honey visit.
