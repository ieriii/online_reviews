Please don't take this the wrong way, but I am THE authority on hot dogs. Period. I was born in Chicago, raised in Chicago, and thus have had plenty of time to become a hot dog connoisseur. Not only that, but I moved up to Boston for college and let me tell you -- they DO NOT do hot dogs there (they try, but yuck).  Superdawg. The name itself gives me the sensation of home and pride and hunger. It's the beefiest hot dog I have ever had and worth every penny. You can go to Demon Dogs and get a much cheaper hot dog w/ fries, but it's not in the same league. I take my visitors to Superdawg because it so well represents the Chicago hot dog scene. Every single person I have brought to Superdawg has been floored.  Be sure to have a chocolate shake or malt with your order.
