I just wrote a tepid review for Avec, and couldn't help but reminisce about my great experiences at Mercat. Mercat ALSO has a beautiful open kitchen, delicious bacon wrapped dates, great atmosphere, and good service. I don't even think Mercat is more expensive, although the portions might be a bit smaller. I went to Mercat once for dinner with about a month ago, and then came back for the Restaurant Week luck recently. Both times, I had no trouble getting reservations the day of, and we were seated right away.  For dinner, we had the dates, mushrooms, Paella De Mariscos, the spanish octopus, and some buttery chocolately thing for dessert that was amazing. Also had a great wine list- lots of fun Spanish bottles to try. For lunch, I had the Arroza a la Cazuela (another seafood paella style dish), Tuna with pine nuts and basil, and croquestas de xocolata (fried chocolate things with marshmallows). Also got to try the fried peppers, scallop and hanger steak, which were all great! My co-worker also got a glass of the sangria and seemed very very happy with it.  I'll definitely be back for another romantic dinner soon, or for a good break to the work day!
