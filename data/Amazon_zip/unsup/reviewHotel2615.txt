Horrible Air Conditioning... was there for a wedding last weekend and reception was stifling. Our server Diana was the best, she made sure were had enough water and drinks! I talked to people staying at the James hotel and they also complained about the Air Conditioning saying even free drinks would not keep them there. The staff in general was nice so that why I gave two stars. But they need to fix the A/C
