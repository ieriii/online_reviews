+ 1 Star for having a large menu. I'm not that into pho, but my boyfriend craves it's healing powers, so we bike/train up to argyle a few times a month. +1 Star for having a really cheap sandwich on the menu, that was pretty good for 4 bucks. The chicken was so-so, it could have used more cilantro, and the French bread was just right. +1 Star for all around value and goodness. This seemed one of the more "safe" pho places to go to around Argyle, so I can see why a lot of people are singing it's praises, but frankly there are probably better quality joints on the strip.
