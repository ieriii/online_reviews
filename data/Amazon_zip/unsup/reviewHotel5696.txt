I visited Chicago for 2 nights a couple of weeks ago and spent both of them at the River Hotel. My experience was a positive one. This hotel is located in what i think is a perfect place, right in front of the river, walking distance to lots of places (restaurants, bars, magnificent mile, millennium park). It is pretty nice, clean, great service. It has a 24hr lobby service.  Their restaurant is pretty good/not bad. They have a really good pannini for lunch (brie, with cranberry mayo, smoked turkey and green apple). Their breakfasts, however, were just okay. I recommend going to the Coner Bakery just a couple of yards away for breakfast. I really like the fact that they have, on every floor, a filtered water dispenser with empty bottles. I personally drink plenty of water and not having to buy water during my stay was a plus for me. They also have a 'computer room' with 2 (or was it 3?) pcs with access to internet and printer. This was great to have and came in handy when i realized we had forgotten to print our boat tour confirmation and needed it that afternoon. It's also handy if you want to check in before going to the airport. Ah, the train station is only about 4-5 blocks away. We actually arrived from South Bend, IN via train and were able to find the hotel fairly quickly. One con: VERY small rooms. Very small. It was 3 of us in one room so it was a bit... uncomfortable at times; but not so much, really, as we spent most of our time walking around Chicago. But consider this if you plan to stay here. Free WIfi. Yes, all over the property. Huge plus too. Overall, we were all very happy staying at the River Hotel and thus, it gets 5 stars. I recommend it and if back in Chicago, will try to stay here again.
