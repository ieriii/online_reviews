Worth the Wait? Is anything really worth the wait? It seems that there should be an inverse relationship between the amount of time you wait and how good the place is. I'm not sure if I would wait for 70 minutes again for Revolution Brewery. That being said, it's REALLY REALLY good. The locally brewed beers are unmatched (be careful though, because some of them have as much alcohol content as hard liquor). The food is good too. The burgers, the pizzas, the sandwiches -- all delicious. I highly recommend going here.
