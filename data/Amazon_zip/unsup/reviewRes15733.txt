I still love Violet Hour, but it has lost some of its newness. I would much rather come here with a group of friends rather than a date. Yes, it is dark and sexy, but you are sitting so far away from your date that you lose some of the intimacy. I'd much rather sit at the bar and watch the mixologists while catching up with friends. The tempura green beans are sinfully good. Again, great drink menu... I think they've really expanded it a lot!
