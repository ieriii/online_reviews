3 stars for food, 4 stars for service and ambience. I've eaten in the lounge and the main dining room. For the money, you might as well eat in the dining room. 3 shrimp prawns for $15? Good, but really? A Zed burger is only $10. Sliders in the lounge are $4/each and very good. Our sever was very friendly and attentive. Food comes out slowly in lounge. Again, beautiful venue and good service. I'll likely be back (to dine in the main dining room).
