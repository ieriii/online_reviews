You can't go wrong with The Gage because it's whatever you want to make of it. If you're looking for a nice bar with an awesome beer, whiskey and wine list? They have it. Casual bite to eat from the Starter menu? Can't go wrong. The food is always excellent and it simply has the feel of a place that is urban upscale...but relaxed enough that you're going to be more than fine in jeans. The Gage consistently puts out excellent, locally-raised food that will be flavorful enough for even the most discerning foodies...but delicious and accessible enough for anyone looking for a flat out amazing meal, special occasion or not.
