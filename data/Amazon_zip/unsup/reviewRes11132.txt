Bongo Room has ruined me. Well, at least they've ruined any brunch that I'll have from now on because I already know that they wont compare. There's a reason why they have crazy long waits - because they're the effing best. The host and hostess were really friendly and efficient, my friend and i were seated in a timely manner, the waitress was great, the support staff wouldnt let my water get below half-full (and I was chugging that because of my overindulgence the night before) and... the food. OMG THE FOOD. I ordered the feta, red pepper and spinach eggs benedict and can easily say it was one of the best meals of my life. Everything on the plate was perfect - the amazing potatoes, the fabulous eggs, the sensational veggies and delicious english muffin. Just go. You'll love it.
