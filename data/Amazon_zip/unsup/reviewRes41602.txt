Just had lunch here, wow, I did not know turtle was edible! I passed on the turtle soup but opted for the lobster bisque - mm, just the right amount of seasoning. The petite filet w/its hot drizzling butter was also delicious, although now I feel like I can feel the butter oozing out of my pores. I don't think I'll be eating anything else today.
