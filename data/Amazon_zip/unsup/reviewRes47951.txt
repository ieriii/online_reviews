you'll like this place if you like meat and fish. i liked the tuna, salmon and steak that they served. could have used a couple of more rounds. i think they slow down the good stuff on purpose. but thats just my suspicion. liked the decor inside and love the rooftop. i would go just for the rooftop on pleasant days or during summer.
