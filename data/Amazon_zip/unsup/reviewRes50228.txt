Went for brunch with a friend. We made 1:30 reservations online about 40 minutes earlier. We had to wait 15-20 minutes to be sat, so closer to 2 pm. The restaurant was packed, we waited outside. Just keep in mind that even if you make a reservation, you are going to wait. Once sat (and the front of house was quite apologetic), our waitress came over immediately with menus and tons of suggestions - she was informative, bubbly and fun, we really enjoyed her recommendations. The latte machine was broken, so they got us regular coffee. It is served with non-homogenized cream and sugar cubes. A simple touch - but definitely set the restaurant apart. We started with popovers and liver pate. The popovers were perfect - warm, flaky with cherry preserves and the best butter ever according to my dining partner. He was not satisfied with the pate, it didn't have much flavor. Beignets came out with this part - they were amazing! What a treat. We each ordered a breakfast cocktail - they were big and Strong! I got a buzz halfway through :-p I think most restaurants overcharge for a weak mimosa, so Big Jones' were a refreshing change. Our main courses: I order the andouille sausage over waffles served with 2 eggs and pea gravy. The sausage wasn't spicy (thank goodness) and tasted like ribs(!). They portion to waffle was a little small, but it was a very interesting dish. My friend got their version of biscuits and gravy, and he really enjoyed them. Once we were seated, our dining experience was great. The server admitted it had been a hectic day, even out of to-go containers, so I'd be very interested to try again. Will return!
