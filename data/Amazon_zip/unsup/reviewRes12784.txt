I gave Texas an extra star for the discounts they email me.  Yeas Better salad area, hot and cold foods, lobster bisque, and sushi bar! attentive service if you are lucky enough to get the meat fresh off the rotisserie the outside will have a reall nice char and crust that is oh so yummy and full of flavor......WARNING not a good idea if you have high cholesterol, but sometimes i like to chew the fat :) bananas with some cinnamon sugar sprinkled on top discounts!!!! sign up for the emails! Blahs the meat can be overly salty, we mentioned this to our waitstaff and they said they put a liberal amount of salt on the outside to maintain the flavor the popovers are a little firm and doughy
