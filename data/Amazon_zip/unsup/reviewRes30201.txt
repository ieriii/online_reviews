If not for my friend and his wife that live a block or 2 away, there is likely NO chance I would have ever stumbled upon this place. The 3rd Coast is their neighborhood go-to spot, and I can totally see why. Good, reasonably priced and super diverse menu. From beef sandwiches, to breakfast, to jamaican curry--you can get just about anything here. I had the beef sandwich--which was good, not as good as many famous spots in Chicago, but good nonetheless. If you are in the mood to get away from the crowds (and prices) at many other Gold Coast establishments, give The 3rd Coast a shot, you are sure to find something that hits the spot!
