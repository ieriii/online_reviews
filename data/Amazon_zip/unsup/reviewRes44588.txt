If I lived in Wicker Park there is a good chance that I would have the body of that bedridden man that had to be airlifted out of his house. The hazelnut cupcake is bliss, plain and simple, and for a shop that specializes in sweet treats, the sandwiches are quite tasty as well. I thoroughly enjoyed the portobello sandwich on foccia with goat cheese. yum yum yum! See ya again soon Alliance!
