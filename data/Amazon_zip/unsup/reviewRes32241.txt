Thumbs up for this joint, the best vegetarian restaurant I've ever had the pleasure of eating at. Dropping by here the late night of a neighborhood summer festival could have proved dubious, but the staff were in high spirits and so much fun to talk to. The food, too, was awesome. I'm not huge on meat-substitute cuisine, but this diner did it right. The side orders of shakes and other treats made the experience fun and diner-like, as did sitting up at the counter. We finished our meal off with a truly delicious piece of coconut cake - vegan, of course - made in-house. You'd never miss the dairy in this place's desserts (which can be had from time-to-time at Madison's Whole Foods, if anyone's interested).
