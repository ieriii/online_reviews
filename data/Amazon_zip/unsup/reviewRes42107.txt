I had a very lovely experience at Gilt Bar last night with the girls. The Pimm's Cup cocktail was fantastic and refreshing. For our dinner, we had mussels, pork belly, the special side of corn bread and truffle noodles. Everything was tasty. Service was friendly and relatively quick. My one gripe was the plates. They were so tiny for us to share 4 dishes that came out all at the same time. I wish we either had bigger plates to accommodate servings of all of our dishes or that the food came out in a progression. Other than that, this is a place that I would definitely come back to.
