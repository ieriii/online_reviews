I stayed here for business for three nights in the middle of winter and I was disappointed. Is it a hotel for business travelers or a swanky couples getaway? It can't seem to decide and my fear is that it does neither very well. Upsides? Great central location one block from the train. Spectacular lobby! Comfortable beds/linens. Friendly staff. Downsides? $20 a day for Internet? Even on the executive floors. No wifi in the room. I was stuck in my room working for two days. I couldn't move my laptop and the chair was too low for the desk. Not comfortable. $18 a day for the gym? C'mon! Even on an expense account, I could not justify that. Bad food. Granted, I didn't try the restaurant. I was here on business and I always order room service. Point me to a hotel that serves good, relatively healthy food in my room and I'll be thrilled. Also, I don't know if it was because it's low, low season in Chicago, but there were rarely staff at the concierge desks. I was more effective helping myself on the Internet the one day I ventured out. I would not recommend this hotel for business travelers.
