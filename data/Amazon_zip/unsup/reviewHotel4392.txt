I am so disappointed by this hotel. The rooms are small, the food is bad, and the lighting is fluorescent. All of which I was willing to overlook until I tried to get a bottle of water. There are no mini-bars in the rooms, the vending machines on my floor were all broken, room service wanted to charge me $10 for a single bottle of water, and when I called the front desk to complain they said that I could go down 12 floors to get a bottle of water from them if I wanted one. Water should not be so hard to come by.
