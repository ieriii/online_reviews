A bit noisy and a tad pretentious but the food is good and the sangria is great! The seemingly ubiquitous Patatas Bravas were fabulous as was the sauteed spinach. Service was a bit strained even for a weeknight but it WAS busy. Location is great, right on Michigan Ave and convenient since we were staying right in the historic Blackstone Hotel.
