I'm a big fan of Greek cuisine. Big. Huge! This food here was mediocre. It was good, but not excellent. My dishes (chicken w/ rice, salad, eggplant appetizer) just lacked flavor, including salt. Where were all the herbs and spices? Not on my plate, that's for sure. The other people at my table were falling over the moussaka and the dolmades. I'm not a huge fan of grape leaves and I recently made moussaka and I didn't want anything that heavy. The service was a little to quick. A busboy kept coming up and very quietly (that I could barely hear him) asking us if we were done, the server came at all the appropriate times, and the food came out fairly quickly. Either way, if you want authentic Greek food that has flavor and , maybe look somewhere else first.
