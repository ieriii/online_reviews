Chicago Q is absolutely delicious! They bring an unexpected bit of southern charm to the Gold Coast. When I walked in I felt like I had entered the home of Paula Deen. The restaurant is very warm, welcoming and home-like. I'd call it upscale bbq, but guests were dining in attire of all types from professional business attire to jeans and tennis shoes. The servers were very attentive and friendly. Now onto the food. Oh my gosh, yum! They started by giving us homemade pickles and chips, which are included as free starters. I ordered smoked chicken, which by no means was your average chicken. It was very flavorful and served with three homemade bbq sauces. My friend enjoyed 1/2 slab of St Louis style ribs, which were some of the most tender ribs I've tasted. We enjoyed cornbread and mac and cheese as sides. This mac and cheese is a brulee style served in a quaint skillet and is out of this world.    I would highly recommend making a reservation! Q gets very busy, especially on the weekends.
