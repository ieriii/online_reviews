Okay, I'm Asian and usually avoid Asian restaurants that A) are not in Chinatown, B) in a yuppie area, C) named something like Simply It. That being said, I was impressed with the Vietnamese cuisine here. Bo luc lac was tender and flavored nicely, pho was tasty and plenty of meat, seafood cha gio was crispy & flavorful. They brought a smoothie for my daughter on-the-house when we sat down and free fruit dessert.  I have been to better, but this is probably the best in the neighborhood.
