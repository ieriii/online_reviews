Geja's is romantic. Dim lighting, candle-light, light guitar melodies wafting to and fro. Maybe it is all designed to distract from the dust and cob-webs on the walls and decorations. I was very put off by all the dust around our booth. It definitely killed the mood a little bit. Their white sangria was delicious, but it is sangria so you can't really mess that up. The red sangria was just okay. My date and I much preferred the white. I've been to the Melting Pot before and I have to say that I prefer the options of the Melting Pot a lot more than Geja's. First, the cheese fondue was not to my liking at all. It was too overwhelming after a couple of bites and I just ended up eating the fruit and bread by itself. I would have liked to have had an option as to what went into the cheese fondue---and I'm a big cheese lover, so this was very disappointing. As many others have mentioned, although the meat and veggies are fresh and of good quality, the meat/veggie fondue is not worth it at all. I would skip the meat all together. They use oil and not broth. I much preferred the Melting Pots option of broth or oil. I prefer the broth, but that's just me. My date was not impressed by the use of oil either. We both actually used the lemons provided and the pepper to marinade our meets before we cooked them in the oil to give the food some much needed flavor. The chocolate fondue was nothing special, either. I make my own chocolate fondue at home and mine is much better. However, the service and atmosphere were wonderful. I probably would not recommend this to anyone who has never experienced fondue before.
