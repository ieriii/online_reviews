Again, I'm the carry-out guy. I don't get into the loud, crashing dishes, cafeteria style elbow bumping, cell phone ringing, bumping into the table, neon lights over your head, I need to sit in the window to be seen Chicagostyle of "dining out" around here. When entering I asked it they offered carry-out. The "hostess" at the front door affirmed and she handed me a menu. I leaned on something, decided what I wanted and went to place my order.  "Over there at the bar", she snaps. Well, she could have just stated that when handing me the menu (just my humble opinion). Order taker at the bar was quite nice, offered a drink while waiting (standard but I probably would have ordered one while perusing the menu at the bar rather than at the front door - just a suggestion). I meant to ask for the Irish cheese on the shepherds pie for "$1.50 additonal" as offered on the menu. She suggested it. I tipped her just for that and thank God I did as this dish was nothing but mashed potatoes and gravy with some carrots and peas thrown in for color. "Pie" with no crust - no bread?! My co-worker says "the Irish aren't known for their food, ya know". Well, obviously I'm not Irish - hold on, let me double check - NOPE - I'm not. Got the "side" order of mac & cheese. Definitely not what I was anticipating. Kinda dry but quite flavorful. I pushed that "shepherds pie" thang aside and ate the mac/cheese to completion. I think the leftover lb. of mashed potatoes from that shepherds thing dish is still in my fridge.  Here's the extra star for Wilde though. Although obviously faux, this place does have some ambience. It's dimly lit, warm, HAS BOOTHS, a fireplace, is large, not cramped.  I'll be back to dine in this Winter and try some other dishes - for sure (if I'm still employed).
