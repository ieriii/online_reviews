I have a love/hate relationship with Sushi X. On the love part: my husband and I are longtime customers. It is hands-down my husband's favorite sushi in Chicago. I like making him happy by going there with him. On the hate side: the price has really climbed vis a vis the size and quality of rolls, in my mind. I used to be able to justify $9.00 for a simply spicy tuna roll because they used to be HUGE! But I got carryout recently and the order was tiny. It was just ok. On the plus side, nothing beats their wasabi mashed potatoes. The interior is quirky cool and the service is also good. I wish I could give 3 1/2 stars.
