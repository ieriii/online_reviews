I'm in love. Dined here on labor day, late in the evening and I was starving! We were promptly seated with no reservations (mind you it was about 9pm ... and it was 3/4 full, so reservations are probably a good idea on the regular) at the corner of a communal table. Personally, I love the European style seating. In addition to the communal tables, there are booths lining the perimeter of the restaurant, with little doors that close (adorable). This place really has their shit together. It was impeccably clean, the service from the staff was prompt, in addition to being knowledgeable regarding the food and beverages they served (which may I add, the beer list is phenomenal). I love Belgium beers and found a new favorite, while dining at The Publican, called Konings Hoeven - Quadrupel Trappist Ale. There was seriously a party going on in my mouth. I also enjoyed the kobe sirloin for my entree, which was both delicious and refreshing. I was surprised when our server did not ask how I would like my meat cooked and typically I like my meat well done; however it came out medium rare and it was actually amazing. Paired with peaches, greens and breadcrumbs, I ate the whole damn thing. My boyfriend ordered the farm chicken with summer sausage and fries and a Orval Trappist Ale, which was also delicious (but I think my pairing was better :P ) We also tried the grape sorbet for dessert, which was perfectly tart. yum. yum. yum. Oooh. The bathroom was also fun and interesting. Right off the hostess stand, is a square room with a large, round sink in the middle and 5 doors: 3 women, 2 men. I enjoyed the lime & coriander hand soap and lotion from C.O. Bigelow. Refreshing! 3 belgium beers, 2 entrees, 1 dessert & 1 coffee - $88 (without tip). Not too shabby! Did I mention I can't wait to go back?!
