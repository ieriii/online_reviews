I have lived in Chicago my whole life and many of my friends, specifically my greeks friends throughout the years always talked about Greek Islands being the best Greek restaurant in Chicago. It took me 30 years to finally try it and it was exactly what everyone ever said it was, absolutely AMAZING. The service was a 10, the food was a 100 and even the prices weren't that expensive. I highly recommend Greek Islands as the best greek restaurant in Chicago. I had the pastitsio and it was very good, also recommend the Lamp Chops, Taramousalata, Grilled Octopus, Greek Village Salad and especially the GYROS!!!! OMG Too die for.
