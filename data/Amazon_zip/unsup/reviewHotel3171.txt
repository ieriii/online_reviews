I guess when you take the old Days Inn and give it a new "look" you can charge a lot for the same room. There is definitely a cool vibe to this hotel and the location is great, but the price is a little much. The rooms do have great views and it's nice since it is a little off the Michigan Avenue path. All in all, I wouldn't send my visiting relatives there due to the price.
