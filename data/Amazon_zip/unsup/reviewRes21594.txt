Obsessed. The Xoco salad may be the most delicious thing I've ever eaten. I've never been during the lunch rush, only during evening dinning hours, but it's never been more than an hour (well worth the wait!). The sparkling water on tap and delicious guacamole are the perfect compliments to the perfect meal. I never leave feeling too full, just perfectly refreshed. AND I love how all of the ingredients and their origin (all local) are listed right when you walk in.  Rick Bayless, you are the man.
