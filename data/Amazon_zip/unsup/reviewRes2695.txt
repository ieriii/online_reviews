Sort of in a secluded area at night, but overall I really enjoyed my meal. Went for a business dinner and had a great meal. Definitely pricey, but you should realize that before going in. Good drink selection, good food, and excellent service despite the fact that my waiter kept confusing my orders with the only other Asian in the dinner party.
