Decent Italian food in a cozy atmosphere. It is a BYOB place, which is super nice! I have been here twice and the food is fresh and decent! The last time I had the mushroom risotto, which was just a tad too mushroomy and a tad too salty. I would go a different route next time. It wasn't the best Italian I have had, but you can't beat the proximity! And, you don't find many Italian places that are BYOB.
