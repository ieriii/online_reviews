Went to The Gage as a visitor from NY with some locals. I couldn't have been more impressed! Their beer/wine selection was expansive, and our waiter only added to our great experience. He was knowledgeable, friendly, and suggested some great things.  I branched out from my usual routine and had the bison tartare with quail egg. While the plate was small (as an app), it was DELICIOUS. Couldn't have been better.  Topping it off my friend and I shared the peanut butter beignets with caramel ice cream for dessert. In a word? Heavenly. I could have ordered three more plates of it.
