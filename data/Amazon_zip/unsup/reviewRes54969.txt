Sparse decor. Amazing bourban and beer list. Delicious foods (that I've tried)I've come several times for beer and made-with-love cocktails. And now for the patio (can't wait for the beer garden) But I had not tried the food untill recently. I've heard mixed reviews from friends about the small portions and lack-luster flavor. But when I tried the catfish with collard greens I was amazed! Delicious. Slightly pricey though. I guess that's how it is at a hot new place!
