yelp fanatic review #32402935: i will try to keep this review in check, but simply writing about this place makes me a little bit sideways.... i pretty much love everything here. from the breakfasts: arroz con huevo (rice, eggs, black pepper, avocado) , gallo pinto (rice mixed with beans and served with eggs/plaintains..GET BOTH) to the stuff with meat: pepito sandwich (ribeye, onions, beans, and lizano sauce)/ the fat juicy pork chops (with all the accompaniments) onward to the stuff without meat: the veggie 'i don't need to explain these' burritos/the amazing potato tacos (can't find these things anywhere else!) and finally finishing it all off with the shakes: oatmeal with or without milk, strawberry, whatever! JUST GIVE IT TO ME! I DON'T CARE WHAT COMES OUT OF THE KITCHEN, JUST PUT IT ON A SHOVEL AND DUMP IT DIRECTLY INTO MY BIG FAT MAW! EXTRA LIZANO SAUCE TOO!! ps-ahem, sorry for losing my cool. those of you who have eaten here understand my craziness.
