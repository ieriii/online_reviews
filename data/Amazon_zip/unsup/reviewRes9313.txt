I was there on my vacation and we had to find a place eat dear downtown. My friend said we go try this place and here is what I can say about this place from someone who has been in CA for a while. Pro: environment (only if you stay inside) Con: Very expensive, 3 of us 85 bucks for lunch and we weren't even full. I can get the same quality of food here in San Jose for less than 25.
