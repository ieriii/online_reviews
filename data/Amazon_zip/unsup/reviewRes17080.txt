Went last nite. Horrible horrible horrible. Bland and GREASY specifically. Ordered cocktails (mine was an Indian martini supposed to be served chilled)- which was warm and late- served post soup course. UGH. Ordered seafood soup, lobster curry, eggplant bharta, garlic naan, raita, basmati saffron rice. What can I say? The rice and the naan were a solid 8 out of 10. The rest was the WORST Indian food we have ever eaten. I absolutely adore Indian food. These folks need to focus on what the heck they are doing. The LOBSTER WAS RUBBER. Inedible. Try another place I beg of you this is not the one for Chicago.
