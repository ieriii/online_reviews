Whho wee.. if you're looking for some romance or lovin tonight, THIS is the place to take your date. I came here with my boyfriend for our two year anniversary. We had never done fondue before and it must've been written all over our faces. The decor of the restaurant is very dark and lit by dim lights and candles. We each ordered two premier dinners (which I think is the way to go). All together we ate bread, grapes, apples with cheese fondue, cooked in oil several veggies and scallops, chicken, lobster and shrimp. For dessert we had coffee with strawberries and bananas, which naturally we dipped in chocolate. I should also mention the dinner came with a salad so it was a lot of food! We were at the restaurant for about 3 hours all together. Our waitress explained our long to cook the meat, veggies, etc. and just overall explained how fondue worked with the utensils and such. Hands down some of the great resturant service I've ever had. She was attentive but didn't bother us as most servers do. The restaurant surely lives up to its reputation of being the most romantic restaurant in Chicago. I can definitely see myself coming back for another special occasion.
