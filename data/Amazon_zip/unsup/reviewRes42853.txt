Awesome spot for my first Chicago-located Chicago-style pizza! The place definitely feels like a "locals come here" type of place. When I came there I asked the man next to me who was ordering what's good to eat, and he said immediately, "everything." The man behind the registered second his idea. I had a slice of Chicago style pepperoni and sausage pizza, and the one slice was plenty to fill me up. My parents and I also shared their supreme salad, and it was not only delicious, but filling also. I would definitely recommend this spot. Oh, and even better, it was only like, 4 dollars for the slice!
