What a beautiful restaurant! Coming to Sabatinos thanks to my boss's treat he ate the spaghetti and I had a large salad with avocado, artichoke stalks, olives, tomato, raddish, and they were large vegetables. The atmosphere is dimly lit with white dangley lights and gorgeous wall paper of grape vines in the fields all around the dining room. There was a violinist and guitar player getting ready to play and the staff were professional and delectable. For dessert it was spumoni with other mystery flavors of creamy rich ice cream. For starters it was short slices of melted cheesy garlic bread which were filling enough for the whole meal and spoiled my appetite pretty much so half the salad was light and enough for the large elegant plates of this restaurants fresh and well prepared and served dinner. The owners here work very hard around the clock to keep such an enriching dining experience for their guests and I am very appreciative to have been able to experience Sabatinos on my boss. He will be getting my work double time for a while. Oh and I would have taken pictures but when you eat with your boss everything is by him and he wouldn't allow me to take pictures. Maybe I was still on the clock?
