3rd Coast was one of our go-to brunch destinations for almost a year (before being un-imported back to the D). Most of the staff is very friendly (the bald gentleman is hit or miss) and the wait is never more than 15-20 minutes (almost every time we've gone on a Sunday we have not waited).  My default was the steel-cut oatmeal, toast, and a cappuccino. The Oatmeal is quite good; I prefer with bananas & brown sugar, but they also have berries and raisins as options too. The toast and cappuccino are pleasant to very pleasant. I do appreciate their consistency with my usual items; I know what to expect and that's a good thing. Everything else we have tried here has all been lovely. I do, however, wish there were maybe just a few more items on ze menu. It's not bare, by any means, but is not imaginative or exciting by any means.  A great little place that tourists generally know not of with a short wait, good food, friendly staff, an ever-changing art repertoire (with all pieces for sale by local artists), and a nice, cozy atmosphere. 3rd Coast FTW.
