if i would have written this review a year ago...oh my review would have been close to 2 stars - because of my pretty good dining experience when they first opened...followed by a really bad delivery experience a few months after that. let's get to the good...b/c I have been to Sushi X 2 times in the last couple months and i have nothing to complain about. the price range and qualoty of fish is close to Coast - a quality BYOB with good sushi, fresh fish and close to mirai prices...but of course, the BYOB keeps the bill down a bit. the atmosphere is like a tokyo hangout - small, tiny tables, dark, concrete floor, loud house and trance music and anime projecting onto the main wall in the restaurant. the boyf loved this and i thought it was pretty cool as well...a sushi dining experience 1st. the rolls are great - not too sweet (unless you O.D. on the honey roll, but still good), the buddha, white tiger, double stack and omega rolls are bomb! they're huge and tasty! they're 2-biters. +the fact that a GOOD sushi restaurant delivers, is rare! ++they're opening up another location on diversey in LP (if you drive by this one during the day, you might get scared - looks like they painted the outside with cheap black paint. at night it looks cool b/c you can hardly see the place and can just spot the small sushi x sign highlighted with blue lights behind it.)
