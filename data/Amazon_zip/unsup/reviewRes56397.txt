This is by far my favorite restaurant in Chicago. Honestly, nothing beats it! It is very classy and very cheap, and you always leave here stuffed! The food is also really healthy and everything is made fresh and all natural. And it tastes amazing! Everyday they have fresh cut flowers on the table, soft music, and the waiter service is excellent, they're on top of their game here, and aim to please! Their lunch special is a huge deal. For around eight bucks you get a drink (unlimited), salad, soup, a huge entree, egg role, rice, and dessert! For dinner it is just as good of a deal at about 10 bucks, and you get more! Just be sure to get a reservation and BYOB. It is a very romantic place in the evening with lit candles and is very swanky. Might be okay to get just a little more than casual. But casual still would do. The owner is always around to make sure everything is perfect. I eat here about 3 times a week! Even if you don't like Asian food, give this place a try because it is different than other Asian food! There is something here everyone will love!!!!
