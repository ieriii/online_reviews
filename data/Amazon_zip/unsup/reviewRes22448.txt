I love Irazu! The food is delicious, the atmosphere is casual and cozy, and despite the constant crowds, the service is always excellent. Plus, it smells like garlic everywhere within a two block radius of this place. Amazing! I highly recommend the vegetarian burrito, which is cheap and tasty. I also love the milanesa dinner and the sweet plantains. Yum!
