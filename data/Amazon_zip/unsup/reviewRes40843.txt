This was an amazing meal. The restaurant is just a cool place. There are only two servers for the whole restaurant, but they don't miss a beat and they really add to the whole experience. The food was fantastic. We did the thirteen course, and there wasn't a single dish that was a miss. There were a couple components here or there that weren't perfect, but overall every dish was well-conceived, well-balanced, and well-executed. A couple stand-outs were the rabbit, the bacon and eggs, and the cheesecake. We can not wait to come back. This was the best meal for the price point that we have eaten in Chicago.
