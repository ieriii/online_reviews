The Bongo Room for Breakfast in Chicago is the BEST! Every day a different menu, with the BEST and most delicious items you have ever seen. Now they have 2 locations -- A MUST EAT in Chicago if you want the best -- I loved the Key Lime Pie Pancakes or Lemon Meringue Pancakes and there are different items each day. You won't be disappointed!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
