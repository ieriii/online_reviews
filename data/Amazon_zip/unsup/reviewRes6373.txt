This review is for the party platters offered by Wildfire. My office catered its holiday party from here and we were NOT disappointed! I usually dine at the Wildfire in Oak Brook and haven't yet sat at a table at this location. In any case.... yes, the food is pricey, but you get DELICIOUS food with Texas-sized servings that make you feel a bit guilty and gluttonous. Each platter is supposed to serve 8-10 people and they actually could probably serve up to 12 people. Our office ordered: Wildfire Chopped Salad - DELISH! Chicken Tetrazzini Pasta - DELISH! Barbequed Chicken - DELISH! Prime Rib French Dip - ok, these were good, but kind of fatty. Redskin Mashed Potatoes - DELISH! The managers we arranged our meal with were very friendly and accommodating, too. Also, a minus because they couldn't deliver the food to our office, so we hired a messenger service. All the food still arrived HOT, labeled clearly, and was very well-packed for travelling.
