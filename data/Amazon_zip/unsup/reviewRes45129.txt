I would actually give Anteprima 3.5 stars, if I could. I love the location and it's a great place to stroll in the evenings. Anteprima is quite lively and usually pretty packed. The food was ok. We had the arugula, asparagus ravioli, olives, and the strawberry rhubarb crisp. Very nice wine list... they only serve Italian wines, but a wonderful array.  Everything was nicely prepared and the service was outstanding. The food was tasty, but it didn't wow me. I think the ambiance hyped me up, more than the food. However, I would still go back to Anteprima, if someone else were buying.
