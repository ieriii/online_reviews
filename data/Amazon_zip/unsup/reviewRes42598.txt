Don't let the enormous menu intimidate you. I have gone wild with my ordering and haven't found anything disappointing. And that goes for their more traditional Brazilian food to their odd ingredient pizzas to their appetizers and entree that appear to be an odd hybrid of cuisines. Most of what I ate was delicious and extremely satisfying. They have a large delivery radius too. Though it is a take-out place, the quality of the food is definitely above take-out in terms of preparation ad ingredients.
