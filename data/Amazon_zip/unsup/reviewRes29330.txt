I get one of their soups ALOT - if I could rate the components, I would. The chicken would get zero stars. My guess is that they cook the chicken, then throw it into the steaming hot broth where it sits all day - so when you get your soup, the chicken is so tough it's nearly inedible. It would be so nice if they cooked the chicken to order and then added it to the broth. The large pieces of lemongrass are annoying, but the broth is magical and makes up for it. Just be prepared to strain out the lemongrass and the chicken (maybe you can give it to your pet).
