I was a little disappointed with my visit here. Pros: we were sat on time for our reservation, and the front of the house was friendly and orderly. I enjoyed the "old school" ambiance of the place. The waiter was nice. Cons: service was lacking. When I finished my iced tea, another was brought out but no one ever removed the empty glass from the 1st iced tea. Runners from the kitchen kept bringing dishes to our table that we did not order. Dirty dishes sat for longer than they should have, both after we finished our appetizers and entrees. Each time we sat for quite awhile with dirty plates in front of us. I don't expect them to be removed immediately....but it just felt like no one was keeping an eye out. Food: we ordered the calamari appetizer and it was nothing special. No different from calamari that's served anywhere else, and in a sea food restaurant I expected something different. I had the crab cake and side of broccoli. Crab cake was fine, but seriously overpriced, especially compared to other places I've had crab cakes in the city. Broccoli was sad. The side was $9 and it was not fresh broccoli. You can tell when it's frozen florets, and that's what this was. It looked like a side of broccoli you'd get at Applebee's. I've been to many Lettuce restaurants many times, and this is the first time I've left feeling disappointed. Update: they saw the review I posted and contacted me. I've been busy and missed the call, but the fact that they read reviews and contact people says a lot. It's hard to give every single person who visits a perfect experience every time...I would not be opposed to giving this place another try sometime as the contact indicates that they really do care.
