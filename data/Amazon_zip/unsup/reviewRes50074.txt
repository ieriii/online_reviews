The red meat here is sub-standard, at least when compared to Tango Sur, the closest thing you can compare it to. However, the starches are out of this world, the vegetarian options are fantastic, the chimichurri here is fabulous, and I like that they have some seafood options, which are fairly good. For me though, places like this are really all about the red meat, so next time I'll choose Tango Sur. In fact, the only reason for my return visit to Las Tablas was the 2+ hour wait at Tango Sur--now I remember why. But I would come back here if the same situation arose, because there is enough here to make it worthwhile.
