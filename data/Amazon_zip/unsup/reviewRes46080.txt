Just had the ahi ceviche, the chicken meatballs and the mini double cheeseburgers. I came with my coworkers for our holiday outing. I am giving this place two stars because the waiters were very nice and very professional and because the decor is nice otherwise it would get one star.  As far as the food was concerned, it ranged from bad to mediocre. The ceviche was the worst ceviche I have ever had. I kept praying that I would not get food poisoning from the two bites I took. Thankfully, it was the second to last thing I ate otherwise I would have spent the whole evening worrying about food poisoning. The mini burgers were ok. Nothing remarkable to write home about. The meatballs were flavorless but with some salt they were ok.  I also ordered the cookies. They were ok, I'm no pastry chef but I could make better. I was just grateful that they weren't terrible though the only reason they were passable was because they were freshly baked. After they cooled, I couldn't eat it them. To be fair the other people in my group liked what they ordered(with the exception of one of the other foodie in the group). In general it seems that the bigger meals are better than the small meals/tapas/appetizers--though to be honest I didn't try anyone else's food so I am basing this on the fact that I ordered small dishes and everyone else ordered larger ones. If this is indeed the case, however, then it is my advice that the Grand Lux only list the things that they do well and get rid of items that they do not do well--i.e. all of their appetizers/tapas/small plates. I wanted to like this place but the only things I liked were the Island Cooler--a fruity drink that was far tastier than the raspberry lemonade that I ordered. I was so relieved that I did not shell out for this meal otherwise I would have been pretty pissed rather than just being grumpy over a bad meal.
