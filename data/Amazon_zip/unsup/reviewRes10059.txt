Great ambiance but the meat pieces laying between the blades on the charcuterie wasn't the best first impression. This was my second time and I didn't care for my entree either night. My wife on the other hand loved hers thus the 3 stars instead of 2. She had the Tuna. The wine list is not an easy read since its mostly Italian wines but luckily I have a little wine background. The patio is beautiful but I will most likely never return unless its just for drinks.
