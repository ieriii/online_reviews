I am a believer in seitan after my visit to Chicago Diner. I had never had it before, but it's honestly pretty good. This is a small place so be prepared to wait, on a Friday night my friends and I waited ~20-25 miuntes, nothing too unreasonable. We started with their version of chicken wings, seitan strips covered in wing sauce, it was actually good, and the vegan ranch dressing they had was a surprise. I got the shawarma and it tasted pretty close to any chicken shawarma sandwich I had had in the past. I sampled my friends rueben, also very close to the original and tasty. We got a free irish coffee shake because of a mistake in the kitchen, and when I go back a shake is going to be necessary, it was really good. This place also won't break the bank for you, $10-12 per person, that's with a beer included ought to set you up nicely. I know this place gets a lot of hype and there's always a crowd, but I think it's for good reason. You won't leave over stuffed or uncomfortable, or really light in the wallet. Chicago Diner is a chance for someone who isn't vegetarian or vegan to step out of their comfort zone, and for someone who doesn't eat meat it's an opportunity to have free reign over the menu. Definitely going back!
