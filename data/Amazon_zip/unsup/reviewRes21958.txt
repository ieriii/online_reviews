I cannot believe that I have lived in Chicago for 4 years and never had been to Superdawg! On a Thursday summer evening, my boyfriend and I were watching Hot Dog Paradise on the Travel channel and the Superdawg piece gave us both a craving for it! We looked up the location and it was only about a 20 minute drive, so we immediately hopped in the car for a spontaneous dinner! I loved the DriveIn aspect of it and the 2 huge dressed up hot dogs (meant to look like the owners which we learned on the show) on top of the roof! Once we both decided to get the classic Superdawg meal including one Chicago dog and french fries, we pushed the button, they took our order quickly, and delivered our dinner in a little more than 5 minutes. One of the BEST Chicago dogs I have had. Poppy seed bun, relish, tomato, pickle, onions, hot peppers...all the necessary ingredients to make an outstanding Chicago dog! It comes in a cute box with french fries. The only complaint was the box needs to be bigger! I am glad I do not live so close to Superdawg or I would be frequenting it way too much!
