Went here with a fellow Yelper who loves this place. I trust his taste so I knew it would be good. We arrived at prime lunch hour and was told there would be a 10 minute wait for a table. Not being in a hurry, we happily waited and enjoyed the near-balmy temperatures outside and caught up. We could smell the delicious aromas emanating from inside and couldn't wait to eat. The adorable hostess dressed in traditional chinese garb soon came and showed us to our table. We looked over the huge menu and it was overwhelming. I deferred to my dc to make suggestions, but I had a couple of my own as well. We opted for the crispy salt and pepper lamb, potstickers, and chinese broccoli with garlic. The potstickers were fantastic. Just enough filling and the wrapper itself wasn't glue-y like you'd find at lower quality establishments. The salt and pepper lamb was perfectly crispy and quite flavorful. It was unlike anything I've ever had in a Chinese restaurant before. My favorite dish though, was the Chinese broccoli. If you've never had this underrated vegetable before, I urge you to give it a try. It has a marvelously mild bitter flavor, almost like a cross between broccoli and asparagus. I could have eaten that whole dish by myself, but then that wouldn't have been very gracious of me. Service is perfunctory; that is, not friendly, but also not surly. Just efficient and no nonsense, which is all you expect from a bustling restaurant at lunch time. Can't wait to go back and try more of the menu.
