After about a thousand times of driving underneath Carnivale on the freeway saying "we should really try Carnivale" we finally went there the other weekend with some friends. I now have pretty mixed emotions. Anger; due to the fact that it took me so damn long to go here, and elation; due to the fact that I've now been to yet another amazing Chicago restaurant! Awesome margarita to start with. We then split the guacamole which was great, but I wouldn't say it was the best guacamole I've ever had. The other appetizer we ordered was the Ropa Vieja which was amazing. I've never really had anything like that before and I'm sure this will be a staple of future visits. For my main I had the ribeye which was cooked perfectly and seasoned very well. Although I think next time I'll try either the skirt steak or one of the pork dishes. For dessert I had some cheese which I wasn't nuts about, but it was still good.  Also, when being seated I just figured this place would be too loud, but it definitely wasn't. I could hear everyone at our table of 6 without issue. Overall this place is great, and will definitely be part of my lengthy rotation of Chicago restaurants.
