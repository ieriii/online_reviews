Everything the Tribune said about this gem is true. The key to their success is fresh ingredients. Everything is fresh and flavorful. The only reason not 5 stars is the service was a bit slow. Parking stinks too. Not your typical Italian restaurant which is why it stands out. Almost like Italian Tapas. Go mid-day though..I hear the crowds after 5 are huge and remember they do not take reservations!
