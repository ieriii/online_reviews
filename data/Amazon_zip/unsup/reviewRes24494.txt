Mediocre experience. I booked the restaurant for my boyfriend's birthday dinner. I left a message on Open table and called a few hours before requesting a special table. Instead, they sat us literally on top of an older couple who had to yell at each other to hear. What should have been an intimate experience was awkward. The portions were incredibly small. I'm a tiny girl, but I left still hungry after ordering 4 plates for my boyfriend and me. While every bite of food was delicious, they were exactly that, bites. If I pay $20 for a dish, it shouldn't be three bites worth. The drinks were excellent, so no complaint there. The service was terrible. The first three dishes came fast, almost too close together. However, then we had to wait 30 minutes or longer for the last dish. When we asked the waiter if it was still coming he responded, "It will come when it comes." If you're looking for a fun, upscale experience, skip the high prices of Mercat and go to Nacionale 27 instead.
