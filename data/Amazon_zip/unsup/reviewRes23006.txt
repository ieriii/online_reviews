Great greek food - really hit the spot. 1. Food: - Broiled chicken with vegetable skewer: well marinated and cooked. - Lamb and beef meatballs: according to my boyfriend, really delicious. On the whole, portions were really great: filling, but not overstuffed. - Tarsmosalata: really delicious, definitely a must-have. According to the waitress, is their most popular appetizer. - Pita: just alright, didn't seem to be the home-made type and was a bit oily almost. - Chicken and vegetable soup: a bit too heavy for my taste. 2. Service: n/a because I got takeout, but they definitely were packed! 3. Price: reasonable for what you get. Would definitely come back!
