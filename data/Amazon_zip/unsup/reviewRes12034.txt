We did piece to go and it was a great experience. I've been uber critical of pizzas lately since companion and i have endeavored in making our own. First of all the guys on the phone and behind the desk were super nice. They apologized profusely because my pizza order was a few minutes late. And for take out the pie held up nicely and was still piping hot by the time we got it home. If you are looking for a nice slightly greasy pie this is good pick. The ingredients are really tasty!
