Expensive with a fantastic selection. The deli is beautiful, the meats and fish are all incredibly fresh and quite delicious, the prepared sides and entrees are (for the most part) pretty yummy, though some of them require extra seasoning while you're heating them up (if you ask me, anyway, and I ought to know!) They also sell the best chocolate ever - Vosges - in their dessert counter, which is otherwise pretty outstanding. The mini creme brulee was delicious as well as every other little tart I've tried from it. A pretty outstanding, nice little place - but really on the expensive side, so I hope you either have deep pockets or you're treating yourself a little, because this place could seriously hurt your pocketbook (oh so good). Le sigh!
