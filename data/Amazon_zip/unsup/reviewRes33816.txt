I live a block from Sultan's. When the part of the day arrives that finds me wanting for sustenance, I have two choices. Make food or dig around for enough cash to get a falafel sandwich from Sultan's. More often than not Sultan's wins out in this debate. You can go get a made to order falafel sandwich for 3 dollars. Add a bowl of lentil soup or a spinach fatayer (triangular flat bread with spinach baked into it) for 2 bucks more and you are out the door for 5 dollars (and 44 cents, after Richard Daley gets his share). There are over 100 reviews here that will attest to how great the falafel sandwiches are... if you have never had one, you need to try one. If (like me) you go here often, try this: order a large lentils and rice, instead of all of the Jerusalem salad they put on it, have them put a big ladle full of lentil soup on it. After that, have them cut in two or three falafel balls. This isn't on the menu, but they will make it for you. It tastes great, will fill you like a champ and only lighten your wallet by like 4 dollars. You won't be disappointed. Highly recommended. They have a few newer falafel makers here, so the consistency isn't as good as it was when you'd always have one of the younger Hispanic guys with tattoos making them... but still this place is a five star establishment.
