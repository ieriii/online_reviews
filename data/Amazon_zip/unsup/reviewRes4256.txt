Came just to check this off my Chicago To-Do list. Not impressed, pedigree notwithstanding. Not returning. Rude staff made the atmosphere and experience unpleasant. Other people may think it's funny to get abused like Seinfeld's Soup Nazi - I'm not one of those people. I didn't love the music either, disappointing. We were lucky enough to get seats right at the front, but I didn't enjoy watching people get jam-packed into every little corner possible, then get yelled at for standing in the wrong place. We don't talk while we're listening to the music, but we don't mind if others do; after all, jazz clubs/bars should sound happy and lively and full of laughter, especially in a smaller intimate dive like this. We just wouldn't want braying drunks screaming, that's all. I much much prefer Jazz Showcase. No-one talks there either, but it's full of character, the atmosphere is still fun and lively, there's no surly staff to bring down the mood, and people aren't constantly tripping over me. Hubby enjoyed himself more than I did, he'd rate it 4 stars, maybe. But pffft, I'm the one writing the review.
