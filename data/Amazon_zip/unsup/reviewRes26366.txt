So for my 4th trip to Pequod's I owed it to them to give this place its long over due piece of my writing action and Yelp this wonderful pizza joint. On Saturday before my fellow Wisconsinite (yes it's really a word) friend was due to depart to la France, we decided to treat her belly to the most delightful pan-style pizza that Chicago has to offer. I swear if I worked here, I'd gain 50 pounds in a month and have more dimples on my butt than an orange has on its peel.  Pequod's always delivers! Pizza arrives thick, with perfectly browned cheese-crusted edges, perfectly melted cheese, and a flavor that leaves one believing they'd be willing to eat an entire Pequod's pizza alone. Even I, who doesn't normally eat pizza, can't ever resist. I just wish I had my own cutting utensil so I didn't have to accept the generous pre-determined size slices. Let's just all hope I don't have to go looking for a day job anytime soon.
