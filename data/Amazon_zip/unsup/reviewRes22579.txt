If you like really spicy food and can take the heat, I recommend you come here! Sze Chuan cuisine is known for its spiciness. They grow chili in that part of China and it shows in the food. Lao Sze Chuan is located on the corner in Chinatown square. They have a great deal - all you can eat hot pot. The hot pot is in spicy broth and you request trays of finely marbled fatty beef, veggies, tofu, mushrooms, and many nice hot pot items. I definitely recommend you give this a try. They also have nice cold spicy finely sliced beef. They have excellent service and you won't be disappointed.
