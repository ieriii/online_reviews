I Had the Tour menu and the wine pairing that's the best why to really know what Alinea is all about. Everything was out of this world! and I loved all the dishes and all the wines. I didn't like that Chef Grant Achatz was NOT cooking that night (Thursday march 11) but he runs a good crew, so everything came out just fine. The pork belly is what I really enjoyed. I still have dreams about that playful dish.
