Overpriced Vietnamese food. Inattentive servers. My friend & I split the bill, hers was more because she ordered drinks. The server absentmindedly said yes, he understood when we were directing him how much to charge on each card. Of course he wasn't listening so he switched the amout of $ to be charged on the cards. Appetizer-Had wontons in broth. Very strong flavorful chicken broth. You just can't mess this up. Had some flat noodle entree w/ sliced chicken in some soy sauce. Was okay. Dessert- wonton wrapped fried banana. Pretty good. Small. Won't be back. Wasn't Impressed by the food or service. Tables are seated close together. You sit in uncomfortable wicker chairs. They Try to maximize their space by placing the chairs & tables very close together. I felt claustrophobic as my chair was stuck next to a wall, the other party's chair & the table & my friend's chair, even though the table was to seat 4 pple.
