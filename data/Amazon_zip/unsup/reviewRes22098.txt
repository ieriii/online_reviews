I love Greek Islands! It is my favorite spot on Halsted for sure. I almost never order a meal because the appetizers are so good! The grilled calamari, skordalia (garlic/potato spread), tzatziki (cucumber/yogurt dip), village salad, soups, everything is so good and fresh tasting. Very well priced too. The Ambrosia dessert is the best in Greek Town. We go almost once a week and will continue this pattern!
