I consider myself a pizza connoisseur, so if you are looking for a comparison among Art of Pizza and other deep-dish pizza joints in Chicago, you stumbled upon the correct review.  I've heard so much hubbub about Art of Pizza--people saying it's the best deep dish pizza in Chicago. I already have a favorite in that category so I decided to give it a try. To me, there are two determining factors for evaluating a good 'ol slice of deep dish pie: #1:  the "sauce is boss." If a sauce isn't good there's no saving it. #2: The ratio of crust to sauce and cheese . Here we go: Art's sauce is good and well seasoned so no complaints there. But here's the kicker...Art's pizza has A LOT of bottom crust, probably 1/2 inch thick. There is way more crust than sauce and cheese combined. So, if you like a mouthful of crust then this is your pizza. It's just not my preference.  I have always ranked Gino's East #1 and Pequod's #2 for deep-dish pizza. I love the chunky tomatoes on Gino's East and the fact the bottom layer of (cornmeal) crust is thinner so it lets the sauce and cheese be the stars of the show. Pequod's is similar to Gino's but the caramelized (some people call it burnt) crust is what makes it distinctive. Their sauce is great, too.  As we say in the wine and spirits business, there's no such thing as good or bad tasting--just different. So there you have it. My slightly unscientific review of 3 deep dish pizza joints.
