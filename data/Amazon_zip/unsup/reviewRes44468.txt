Wakamono is my favorite sushi in the neighborhood, right across the street from my favorite Chinese restaurant Ping Pong. The atmosphere in Wakamono is perfect. I love the dim lighting. They have super good sushi , and crab rangoon. The dynamite roll is great, so is the godzilla, and the Kani Chung. The lychee martini is the best ;) They offer a nice outdoor seating area. They are doing something right because they are never slow. Thanks for the good service.
