In a decade that increasingly is dominated by deal creaters, finders and connectors, paying full price for anything these days makes you look like a loser. Felt somewhat smart then, going into Sapori on a Monday night, when the deal of the day was a 4 course family style dinner option for 20 something a head. The restaurant wasn't exactly overflowing - insufficient or less than effective promotion? Or maybe deal snobs do exist! Which had me wondering how Sapori would look on a non-deal day. The food was good, well part of the food at least - my favorites were the pesto gnocchi, rigatoni and tiramasu (one of the best I've had, and I don't even like it that much). The caprese, the butternut squash soup and the wines were mostly forgettable. But definitely not the kind of mouth watering Italian that has you lining up at their door, and paying full price. The ambiance is rather nice, the restaurant surprisingly spacious considering the neighborhood it is wedged in, validated discounted parking ( not free as their website suggests -watch out!) is a perk, but the service was excruciatingly slow. Overall, even though I spent more that night than I expected to (these darn birthday dinners!), I do believe Sapori offers a great bang for your buck - so if you want to give the home kitchen a break on a Monday night, pay a visit to the Sapori kitchen!
