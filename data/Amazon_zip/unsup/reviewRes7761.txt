OMFGWTFMORE! First off... If you plan on going to Fogo de Chao don't eat for 2 days. Fogo de Chao.... You start with almost instant seating. I've been to Fogo 3 times and this was always the case. After your seated the waiter will tell you all about the wonderful salad bar and endless delicious meat. The salad bar could be a meal enough in itself for most people. i would recommend trying a little bit of everything on it. Each "MeatBuddy" (coined by me) comes around with a different type of meat. If your flipped and ready to go they will ask you if you want some. SAY YES! Take all the meat you want! Oh mi Gosh yo... Fill up until you explode like everyone else that comes to Fogo. Last time I was there I took 3 bathroom breaks. LOL! You get the point. Anyways definitely worth the money and my favorite Chicago Restaurant!
