I came here for the lunch buffet and it was great. This was my first time eating Indian food, it was very different for me but I loved it. The service was incredible too, my water never even got half way empty. The best part was they gave us a complimentary chicken! The restaurant was beautiful, the people were great. You should definintely check this out.
