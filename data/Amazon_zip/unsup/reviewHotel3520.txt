I wouldn't say this is a 4 star hotel; but for the price, it is definitely worth 4 out of 5 stars. The best thing about this hotel, is the location--so many places within walking distance! It's located a block away from the (in)famous Magnificent Mile shops, close to tons of restaurants, near the Gold Coast and close to the "L" red line...which helps make even further away neighborhoods easily accessible. The rooms are average but clean, modern and very spacious. The bathrooms, however, could use some updating. The door seems to be a tad too big for the doorway (weird, I know), so closing and opening it was a bit of a struggle. However, I was satisfied with the bath products (Neutrogena). As for the free wireless internet--I'd say it is a plus and at the same time a thumbs down. Free is always a good thing...but it was insanely slow (I'm assuming bc everyone is using it). Overall, this place is an excellent bang for the buck. I would definitely recommend this hotel and stay here, again.
