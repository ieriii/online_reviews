Went with a party of four a couple of weeks ago. Service was fantastic!! Good job to the waiter. Patient and knowledgeable. No significant wait. The Dry Aged Ribeye steak however was a surprising disappointment. Not sure why as I have had good steaks here before, but this one lacked that killer buttery flavor I expect from a prime steak restaurant. It was cooked to a perfect medium as ordered though. I will try them again in a couple of weeks to see if it was a fluke or if the quality has suffered somewhat. Otherwise no major complaints here.
