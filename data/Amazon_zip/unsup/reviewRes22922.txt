After reading the glowing reviews on yelp, I was very excited to go to the greek islands restaurant. But the whole experience was underwhelming. On a friday evening, five of us made our way to greek town. Special mention - FREE valet parking - enough said. We had to wait for 20 mins for a table and we were seated inside. We placed our orders - the saganaki, a cold appetizer and we also ordered our entrees and salad. While we were nibbling on the bread (what? No pita!!) and olive oil and sipping on our wine, our waiter brought all of our 4 entrees, and asked me if we needed anything else. All of us on our table were confused and I was wondering if somehow I missed the whole appetizer round. I told him, we are waiting for our appetizers, and he said of course it is on its way. Well, clearly he forgot... Which restaurant worth its salt brings entrees before apps? Anyway, within a couple of mins we got our saganaki, and there was no flame or anything, it was like he lit a candle and mumbled an 'opa!' We saw it being served on other tables, and it was very exciting. But on our table it was totally anti- climatic. The saganaki was good. The veggie mousakka was easily the best dish, but everything else was just average. Spanakopita was alright- i have had better. If you are a vegetarian, please skip the veggie kebab - totally flavorless and dry. One of our friends also ordered stuffed calamari and he enjoyed it. I don't understand the glowing reviews on yelp for this place. Yelp has never let me down. But I think, this place is over rated or maybe just not a good enough place for vegetarians.
