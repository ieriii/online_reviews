I really don't know what others see in this place. My pasta was not edible and the server cared less. The red pepper flakes were so overpowering the broccoli and shrimp got totally lost. After 2 bites my mouth was on fire. The menu description made no mention of pepper flakes. I truly believe flakes to this extreme are used to cover up less than fresh or flavorful food. So many better Italian and BYO's in Chicago - don't wast time or money on this one.
