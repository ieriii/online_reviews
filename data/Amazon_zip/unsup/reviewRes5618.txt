Went in and was seated at the worst seat in the place with my back to the terminal for servers to rign in orders and the host stand. There were always at least 3 employees behind me bumping me or tipping on my chair with no apologies, I took it upon myself to move seats. We ordered beverages and food at the same time and 1 plate arrived before our drinks. I ordered a quartino of wine and was only brought a glass. My mother was told her beer would be another minute that they were changing the keg. Another plate was dropped and she was then told to pick another beer that that one was out and thhey were not changing the keg. the food was very goo. Later a manager came by and asked if I would like another glass of wine, I did and asked him if she rang in a glass or quartino for me-she did ring in the wrong thing. He asked if I would want a quartino - i did, but I was surprised that with the wrong order before that no apology was made and no change to our bill. They really need to work on their customer service, especially since their staff was using f-bombs a foot and a half away from me and my mom.
