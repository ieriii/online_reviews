Nuevo Leon is a Mexican restaurant in the heart of Pilsen with lots of 'sabor' (flavor), a nice selection and excellent prices. We ordered the enchiladas suizas ($6 per entree) with the fried beans and the rice and they were delicious. One can taste the fresh ingredients in each bite. The waitress was very welcoming; she brought us crispy tortilla chips, a bowl of fresh salsa, and a bowl of pickled chilles and carrots. We were also served a complimentary appetizer that was very delicate in flavor and very delish! Are we going back for more? Absolutely! So should you.
