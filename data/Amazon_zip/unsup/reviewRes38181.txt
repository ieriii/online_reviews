Perfect place to have a great, great beer. I am partial to the enormous variety of Belgian beers. Chimay, Piraat, St. Bernardus, Delirium Tremens just to name a few. Nice place to start out the night on the weekend. Come early because the bar gets very crowded. I try to avoid a mid-week 9pm-11pm beer here because the upstairs bar is only open on the weekends, which makes for an eternally crowed lower level. Some of the staff are the nicest in the business. Talk to the bartender upstairs on the weekends and he'll be sure to recommend a beer that is just for you. The only problem that I have with the Hop Leaf is that I just can't seem to leave sober. Then again, Piraat Belgian Ale is 10.5%!!!
