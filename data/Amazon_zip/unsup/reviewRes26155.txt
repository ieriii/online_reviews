Went here for Restaurant Week, braving an awful cold and gross weather, and boy am I glad that I did. We had the chef's tasting menu, on special for $35, and it was incredible. Started off with a spinach salad that had a gorgonzola like cheese, a sweet vinaigrette, serrano ham, and bacon. Smokey, sweet, and delicious. Next was a cheese, apple, sauce pairing. The cheeses were tasty, though not anything mind blowing. Following this was an amazing soup, the chicken broth infused with saffron giving it an incredible flavor and color. It had delicious chorizo, chicken, potato, and rice in it. It was topped with a slice of toasted bread covered in their house-made smoked paprika aioli, which paired amazingly well with the soup. This was probably one of the stars of the meal. Next was a skewer of their amazing chorizo, and some tiny omelettes with spinach, onion, and potato (this was the only thing I didn't really care for - but I'm not a big omelette fan anyway - others at the table loved it). Following this we had wilted spinach with black currants and pine nuts topped with shaved apple. Perfectly charred steak (with amazing flavor) over shredded short rib meat, on top of a potato pancake. Gigantic tiger prawns (with the heads still on - that was a little weird for me, had to have someone else behead the beast, haha). And an AMAZING little cast iron skillet filled with a medley of garlicky mushrooms. I was totally full at this point (and worn out thanks to the stupid cold) and did not partake in the chocolate croquettes, which were apparently orgasmically good. My friend who came with me said it was the best meal she ever had. It certainly ranks high for me, and I would definitely want to come back.
