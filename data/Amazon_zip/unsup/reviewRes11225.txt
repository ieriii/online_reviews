Get here early. People wait like lemmings hoping for a seat, and will crowd around you if you're seated at the bar. All for some rockin' pizza and great beer. It's good, but nothing is worth waiting that long for, right?  I feel kind of naughty eating nothing and drinking pint after pint of Pabst. No worries, though. My dining companion ate pizza and drank her beer while I attempted to drown my sorrows in the cheap stuff. And I have my school's financial aid department to blame for this.
