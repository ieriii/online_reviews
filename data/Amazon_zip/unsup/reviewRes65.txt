Absolutely amazing! One of the best meals I have had in years. It is expensive but worth every penny. I can't think of another restaurant in the US who has created a better experience.  Definitely not kid friendly though they did accomodate my son with a special treat.  Trust the wait staff. They won't stear you wrong. Can't wait to go back.
