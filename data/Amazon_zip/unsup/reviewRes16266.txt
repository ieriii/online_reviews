This is my favorite bar in Chicago. Yes, I get judged for saying that. Yes, the atmosphere is slightly pretentious. Yes, the drinks are very expensive. Yes, the line to get in is always obnoxious. I don't really care. The drinks are perfectly prepared, very strong, and worth every penny of the $12. These are cocktails to be enjoyed, not guzzled. I like the no mingling/standing rule; most of the time when I'm out with friends it's to sit and catch up with them, not to rub elbows with the rest of the bar. The music volume seems to have steadily climbed since I started coming here, but it's still at a level that allows conversation without shouting. Sitting at the bar and watching the bartenders work their magic is great. Equally so is getting a booth to sit with a group and have a real conversation. Good for date night, good for a chat with the girlfriends.
