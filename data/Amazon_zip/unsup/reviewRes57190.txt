Wow. I went here back in March of '07 and I was very impressed with this place. The main dining area was expansive and the decor was decedent and beautiful. The foods were rich in taste and the selection on the menu was mouth watering. The service was also very good. My girlfriend and I especially liked the raspberry mojitos. Can't wait to come back here.
