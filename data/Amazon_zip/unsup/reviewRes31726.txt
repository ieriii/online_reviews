I dined at Sunda with my boyfriend, he lives in Chicago and had never been. We had difficulty making a reservation, even the day before. It's a very popular place. Ben was our waiter and he was excellent. He was very knowledgeable about the menu and made excellent suggestions. The peared saki, rock shrimp tempura, and kobe beef tartare were amazing! The food, vibe, and service all made for a great night. We will definitely be back.
