Had the Paccheri con Salsiccia e Pomodori al forno and the Riccio di Mare e Granchio...very awesome. The portions are unlike many Italian places which aim to satisfy the appetite of gluttonous animals....they serve a decent amount: Flavorful and filling.  The wine selection was impressive, and the atmosphere was business-casual-after-a-long-day-at-work.  This place has a really great vibe. The prices are very reasonable, and the food was great. The service has room for improvement, a little slow, but i am confident they will be above an beyond as time allows. Highly recommend
