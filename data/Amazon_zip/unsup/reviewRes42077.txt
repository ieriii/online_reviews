(Review breakdown: 4.5 for food, 2.5-3 for service. Let's just call it 4 stars) There are a number of restaurants out there which have adopted a no-frills-bordering-on-rude approach to restaurateurism as their schtick. Those establishments are ghastly and insulting and anyone who patronizes them willfully should speak with a mental health professional.  There are no-frills joints like Tank Noodle, however--and it's a joint if ever there was one--where the experience is so deliciously raw that you know it's not an affectation; it's the real f*cking thing. You may have to share a table with strangers. Your server may seem to be in a rush. There will be screaming children. The bathroom will haunt you. This is all part of the charm. But really, once you taste the succulent banh mi, delicate spring rolls, hearty chao, and rich pho, you won't care about the noise, brusque service, or shabby decor. And the price is certainly right. Tolerate no cheap imitations! Shun all gimicks! Demand Tank!  You deserve it, you slob.
