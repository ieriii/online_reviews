I love food and I know a good restaurant from an okay one. I was a bit disappointed with the hype of this place. I had very average steak tacos and paid $16 (lunch price) for them. It was just raw steak, a tiny bit of guac, and nothing else to put in the taco? The drinks were great, and chips and guac good as well. I don't think it was worth $35 per person for lunch, I'd MUCH rather go to Uncle Julios (the besssst steak fajitas around).
