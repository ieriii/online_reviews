I like meat. And sangria. I also like them together. When you walk into this place, you feel like you've stepped foot in a warm, meat filled cave. Its dark, with dark tables and walls, but not so dark that you cant see what you are eating or who you are stepping over. We ordered one appetizer for our table of 3, the Chorizo con Arepa. It wouldnt have been my choice, but it was delish - the pork sausage was amaz-o. It was a small appetizer, but probably just enough because the entrees are huge. I had the pork loin (OH. MY. GOD.) and it came with yucca, plantain and potato. My bf's steak was even better. Monday is 1/2 price sangria. Yippee for me! Today's Groupon is for this place. Go buy a few!
