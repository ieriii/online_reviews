LOVE this restaurant. We eat there all the time. The beet and potato salad is delicious as are the sambusas. For dinner we always get one of the sampler platters (worthwhile to spend the extra few dollars to have access to anything on the menu) and try a few new things each time. I'll be honest: the service is pretty bad. BUT, the servers are VERY nice and they give great suggestions for menu items. And, I think the service is getting better, as I have recognized a new manager who seems to know what he's doing.Overall, a wonderful place that I will continue to return to because the DELICIOUS food FAR outweighs the mediocre service.
