Celebrated New Year's Eve here this past Friday with the hubby. Did the fixed price dinner with wine pairings and really enjoyed it. When I had told my husband via phone about the menu being offered that night and that one offering was buffalo, he hesitated. But I have to tell you that we both thought the buffalo course was the absolute best. Whoever was cooking that night did a superb job and the overall meal was definitely worth the cost. The wine pairings were quite good. We had a nice buzz going by the end of dinner. We weren't hurried during our dinner. The pace for the different courses was relaxed but not slack. Our server was knowledgeable and fun to chat with. The atmosphere is more lounge like and a bit tinny, with no carpeting on the floor and the room so large and open. Felt like you were in a loft in a warehouse. Would definitely return to sample more wines at their special events.
