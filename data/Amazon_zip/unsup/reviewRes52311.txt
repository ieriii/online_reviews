I love Gino's. It's as easy as that. Sure some of the other well known deep dish pizza places in Chicago are good... but Gino's, I believe, is the best. You do need to be ready to wait 45 min- 1 hour for your pizza to cook when the place is busy (which is almost always). But so worth it. The crust is phenomenal. And the sauce is yummy. Also very cheesy which is okay by me. This location in particular is very touristy. When my husband, friend, and I came up to the place we thought we would have to wait an hour to sit, but they were awesome about keeping people moving. We really only had to wait 20 min. max. I say come here with some friends, grab some beers, draw on the walls, and by then your pizza will be ready. If you do draw on the walls be sure to bring a sharpie with you. Ball point pens just won't do. Or if you really want to be recognized, bring a white out pen with you.
