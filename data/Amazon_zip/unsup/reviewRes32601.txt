I went to Sunda last weekend for brunch with my sister. It was my first time there for brunch and only my 2nd time in general. Let me just say, as far as service goes, it was one of the BEST experiences I've had since living in the city for 2 years. Sunday brunch is a perfect time to go to Sunda because it was not crowded at all and the noise level was very conducive to a quality conversation. First thing I loved about the brunch was that they bring you out a complementary piece of caramel covered banana bread as a starter. It was to die for and actually might have been my favorite part of the meal. The other signature thing Sunda offers for brunch is one the coolest bloody mary bars I think I've ever seen. Although, I don't drink bloody mary's, the unlimited garnishing bar included over 20+ items including for bbq eel (amazing) and every vegetable imaginable for only $6.95! Plus there were small plates at the bar, in case you just wanted a side dish of veggies etc. From our waitress, to the hostess, to our water guy, everyone was extremely friendly and accommodating. We ordered as an appetizer the steamed sticky rice which had a wonderful smooth flavor. It was a bit salty for my taste, but I am super sensitive to that. Then for our meals, we ordered the eggs benedict (one of my fav brunch items) and the firecracker maki roll. The firecracker maki roll was great, but the eggs benedict unfortunately came out cold and just was not good. However, when I told the hostess of this, she apologized profusely and asked us if we wanted anything else. We decided to order a few desserts including the chef's daily special and mochi instead. When we got our bill, the eggs benedict was taken off and we received a 20% discount, which essentially took care of one of our desserts. Very good customer service!!!! Overall a great experience, with the service and atmosphere topping the actual food in my opinion. I would definitely go back and try lunch or dinner there.
