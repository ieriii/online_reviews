I'll be genuinely disappointed if Michelin fails to give Schwa its due recognition. I called the restaurant at 4pm on Labor Day and was thrilled when Matt picked up the phone and offered up an 8pm reservation the next night.  These guys don't fall into the same mold of all other fine dining restaurants. Where else can you eat a beef mole s'more with a campfire aroma while listening to jacked up hip hop in a BYOB space more fit for a large family than a restaurant? We did the 9 course, which ended up being 11 excluding the amuse (though they substituted the sweetbreads for a veal tongue dish) and they didn't miss with a single plate. The elotes and the smores dish were the favorites and the quail ravioli lived up to the hype. What Michael and his kitchen manage to do with these alternative ingredients is magnificent. After having done the Tour menu and wine pairing at Alinea this past spring, I wouldn't hesitate to say that the inventiveness and sheer quality of the dishes at Schwa compete. The only difference is I can wear a t-shirt and jeans and feel completely comfortable. Keep up the good work, Schwa. If only others in the industry could be themselves and sacrifice hoopla for comfort while creating Michelin quality dishes I would be a happier, albeit fatter, person.
