A note to my rating of 4 stars: I will go back to try the baby back ribs and if they meet my expectations, I would give this place 5 stars. It's about time we get a barbecue restaurant in my neighborhood. Great restaurants like Luciano's on Rush and Papa Milano's on State have come and gone, and still we have to go to W. Division to Smoke Daddy or the NW side to Fat Willy's to find some good BBQ. I think Chicago Q is off to a great start. Went for lunch and tried the pulled pork and pulled chicken. I think the sign to good pulled pork is that you don't need to add any barbecue sauce. And while the 3 sauces that accompany your meal are excellent, especially the classic sweet one, I did not find myself reaching for it to add to the sandwich. Cole slaw side was above average, baked beans are meaty and fantastic. Hush puppies are a must for an appetizer. They are good on their own as well as with the spicy dip they're served with. The cornbread was outstanding as well. The restaurant's decor is very nice and does not look like a typical BBQ joint. Obviously, the food is most important, but the atmosphere is great. I look forward to them adding a full bar - it should become very popular soon. I will be back and update my review once I've tried the ribs. To be continued...
