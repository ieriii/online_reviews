I was recently in Chicago on business and my client took me to Tru. Well lets start by saying that Tru is, indeed, a True experience. This is what the loosely used term fine dining is really meant to be. Everything was truly amazing, it took them less than two minutes to sit us at a beautiful table, and within three minutes we had not one but two waiters taking our drinks order, and serving us. We selected our napkin color (strange, but cool), and had a great three hour dining experience. We opted for the tasting menu and each dish was flawless. The ribeye with the grilled foie gras stood out as the most memorable for myself. The meal was enhanced by the personal service of Carlos. He really made it an exceptional experience. He recommended us some great dinner options, port and cheese as well. If you go, request him.
