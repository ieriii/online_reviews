I had the antelope tartare, speck salad, and carmelized lobster with quinoa because this is the sort of place in which to be adventurous. The royal HE had a hamburger, chicken noodle soup, and for his starter-pickles and olives. HE wasn't too adventurous. Our server, Melissa, had the perfect waitpersonality...not snooty or perky or overly friendly or underly friendly.  We walked in at 4pm on a Saturday and by the time we left it was packed.
