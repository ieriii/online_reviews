Sorry Garicas but you stink! I've lived in LS all my life, when it first opened it was good, but as soon as they started to do well - there went the quality. Sure it's always going to have business because of all the bar and people who don't mind eating 'Mexican slop' being passed as food. When you can't even melt the cheese on nachos or make guacamole and not puree of avocado, perhaps I'll think about returning. Go to Los Nopales, just south of this nasty pit!
