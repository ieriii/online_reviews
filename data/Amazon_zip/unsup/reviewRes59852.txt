Seriously outstanding. Last week, my colleague and I went to Chicago on business, stayed at the Holiday Inn and looked for places to eat. The concierge suggested the Kinzie Chop House so we duly went there.....and WOW... the food was incredible! We were served by possibly the most competent, polite, professional and friendly (without being annoying) waiter we have ever experienced. His name was Frank. The guy is beyond good....literally at the top of his game. We went back a second time and ordered different dishes just to see if they were just as good - and of yes.. they were....the place is brilliant. You MUST go there. Ask for Frank. You won't be let down. 5 MASSIVE STARS.
