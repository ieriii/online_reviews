Authentic and affordable Mexican food. Can get quite busy but they offer free private parking. Larger inside than expected. Lots of families. For appetizers, you MUST get the Queso con Chorizo. Mexican sausage with Chihuahua cheese melted on top. NOM. For entree, the Bistec Milanesa was about on-par. Nothin to rave about.
