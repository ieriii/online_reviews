Three and a half stars, really. Good, not outstanding, solid food. My boyfriend raved about his burger and fries, and I tried the hummus and the tomato basil soup; both were fairly tasty. Nothing to rave about. I also had a side salad, which was way over-dressed, though it tasted fine otherwise. A great option for quick food if you're going to see a film at AMC River East.
