I'm not one for buffets, but when it comes to Indian food I feel a buffet is the way to go! I haven't tried much Indian food but I always let my taste buds run wild at India House. I try anything and everything that I never have before. Their food is absolutely wonderful and the staff is always quite helpful. The flat bread is delicious!!! (I am a carb queen so I usually end up eating half the basket by myself.) They have this one dish with tomato sauce and cheese cubes. Just thinking about it makes me hungry! If you're in Streeterville and feel like stepping out of the box and shying away from typical tourist restaurants, definitely stop in at India House for the buffet. You won't regret it!!!
