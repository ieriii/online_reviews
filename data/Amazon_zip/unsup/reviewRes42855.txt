There are 23 Michelin stared restaurants in Chicago....I look forward to the day gilt bar is the 24th! The execution of their dishes was perfection; from the simplest of salads, there fennel and apple with lemon and honey vinaigrette, to the more involved foie gras and chicken liver mouse, simply perfect. The hard work of the kitchen shows through the knowledge and excitement for the food by the servers, I'm sure if she could have our server would have sat down and joined us to eat. I have never seen anyone get so excited about cornbread (especially a Texan), and then I tasted it and understood where she was coming from. I ate there on Tuesday and on Thursday I'm still thinking of their food, I can't get it out of my head and can't wait to go back!
