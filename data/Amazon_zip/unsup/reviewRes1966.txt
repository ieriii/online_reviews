Expect to wait in a long, long line, especially on a Friday or a Saturday. I spent a slightly chilly spring afternoon waiting in line ~1 hour. It was a worthwhile experience. I ordered: Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage with Truffle Aioli, Foie Gras Mousse and Fleur de Sel ($9) - very flavorful and delicious. The Marty Allen (formerly the Don Rickles) beef, pork and garlic sausage ($3.25) - nothing special. pass on for next time. Duck Fries ($3.50) - The fries were all right. I didn't taste what the hype was about, but maybe my expectations were too high. I'm glad I tried it, but I don't know if I would wait for that long again (or longer...) to have another go.
