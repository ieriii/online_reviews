This was the first time I'd been here in a very long time (over 7 yrs ago). We went on a Saturday night which also happened to be St. Patty's day weekend. The place was packed w/ loud & drunk depaul kids and we got seated after about 15 minutes. The pizza was well worth it though! My boyfriend and I ordered the medium thin crust---still awesome after all these years! I'd definitely recommend!
