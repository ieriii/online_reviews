Well went there this past weekend and I am only giving OK because the food was Excellent. The staff was a little less then OK. The outfit the hostess was wearing when I walked in almost made me close my husbands eyes based on it being way to revealing and some what strip club look. The waiter was average but we waited almost 20 Min's to get a refill on a coke and a glass of wine even though it wasn't that busy. The reason why I still gave 3 stars is the food was Amazing!!! Just please get the service under control and I Will definitely be back. No private dances please my husband heart couldn't handle the stress!
