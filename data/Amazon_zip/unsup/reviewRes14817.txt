My favorite restaurant in the Chicago area. Portions are great, although don't go here if you are trying to impress a food snob. The selection is standard Italian/American fare, but good news: you get salad, soup, bread, starch, and vegetable without paying any extra! That's right, all of the nosh is included in the entree price.  For added intimacy: ask for one of the private booths. It will be all the more special when the strolling violinist stops by to play "Fly Me to the Moon."
