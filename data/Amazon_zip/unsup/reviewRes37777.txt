the deli and other carry out items are outstanding, and while the prices are high they actually carry brand items cheaper sometimes than other places do ( i got a big jar of pommery a few bucks less than i've paid elsewhere) . this is a place for luxury food stuffs, non-essentials and quality deli at high-end prices. the cafe/cafeteria is not too expensive and not as good as might be expected ; they do serve great coffe( tastes like intelligentsia to me) in wonderful arabia ware ( finnish pottery works) a treat on a cold winter's day.
