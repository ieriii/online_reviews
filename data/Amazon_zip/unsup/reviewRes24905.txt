I'm never "in the know" but my partner in crime is all about trying new places and it's a great addition to my tired bag of (Nacho) tricks! Had Friday 8pm reservations for two and waited just long enough in the bar to order Sangrias and admire the updated 70's decor. We were seated in 2nd floor the "party room" looking over the main dining area and it was an amazing view and our room had nice decorating touches that really added to the experience. I had the Seasonal Sangria and it didn't knock my socks off so I ordered the Red Sangria later, and that was fabulous. Up there with the BEST! For Tapas we went with: Mixto- Chef's cheese selection of 3 cheeses Croquetes de Jamon- Serrano Ham Croquettes Higos con Almendras- Bacon Wrapped Figs w/Almonds (the Star of the show!) Tucino con Xerez- Pork Belly, Sherry Glaze , Green Apple & Truffle (the sauce and presentation was out of this world) Espinacas a la Catalana- Spinach w/raisins, pine nuts & apples The waiter also recommended the Rabbit but we couldn't handle eating a li'l bunny, but he said it was great... The waiter was quite helpful, always attentive, and each server (I think we had 5 different people bring our food) was polite and informative! Yes, it's expensive for Tapas, which we're lucky to have plenty of in Chicago; but the atmosphere and food are worth it!
