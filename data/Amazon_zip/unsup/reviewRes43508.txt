The reason I decided to try this place was because every time I walked by it was very crowded, sometimes with lines out the door. Any place that has people patiently waiting, makes me think that it must be worth the wait...and it was! Even my husband who can be a bit picky especially if I choose where we are going, was blissfully happy with his food. We actually each ordered two breakfasts and I had an excellent latte. I got the orange brioche french toast which was amazing because it had a really nice texture and wasn't too sweet. I also had scrambled eggs. My husband got a salmon bagel that looked delicious and he got a roast beef sandwich and soup and he was very happy with all of it! The only drawback is if you are taking your time eating you can't help but feel a little guilty because so many people are waiting for tables.
