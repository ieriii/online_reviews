Chi-Town, I kinda like you! Hot Doug's is SOOOOO good. like, SOOOO good! I'll tell you a story to illustrate just how good it is. We went last Saturday when the heat wave first hit Chicago. It was probably like... 95+ degrees out and people were waiting for over 2 hours in the sweltering heat. During our wait, one poor guy in line passed out from heat exhaustion and hit his head on the sidewalk! The ambulance came, of course, to make sure he was okay, and when he woke up, the first thing out of his mouth was, "did i lose my place in line?" Mmhmm. That is how good it is. We ordered: 1. BLT: bacon sausage with avocado puree, lettuce and tomato 2. Thai chicken sausage: chicken sausage topped with seaweed salad, sriacha mayo (freakin' delicious), and duck cracklings. We weren't sure what the duck cracklings thing was but we assumed maybe duck skin fried and chopped up into little bits? 3. Pecan-roasted beef and pork sausage: with block cheese and.... something else. 4. French fries fried in duck fat. Only served fridays and saturdays The pecan-roasted hot dog... *sigh* it is my love. I will definitely be coming back here the next time I visit Chicago for a rendezvous with this thing. P.S. Fainting guy, if you are reading this, your dedication to good food inspires me.
