Terrible customer service. I placed a large order for take-out; about $90. I ordered a certain salad and they sent me the wrong one. I tried calling back to ask them to correct it and kept getting a busy signal or put on hold for too long. I was having a party, hence the $90 order, and couldn't continue to call them back and hold. I called the next morning asking them to credit the $7.95 to me for my next order, since I do order quite often and they told me there was nothing they could do. I had to have called back right away to get the order corrected. When I told them I did do that, but couldn't get through, the girl said it didn't matter and there was nothing they could do. Some great customer service. Needless to say, I will never order from Calo again or eat in.
