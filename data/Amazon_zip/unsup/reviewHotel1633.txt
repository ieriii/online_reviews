well, its hard to beat the price. location is great too. For the money, i found the hotel very typical. Not nice, but for close to $100/night, what do you expect? As a frequent business traveler, I've paid more for a dive in Fresno... My room was comfortable. Front desk, check in was nearly over-formal for the style of the hotel. The lobby was clean, nicely decorated. I wouldn't be embarrassed having a business meeting there. Pleasant doormen. I had a corner room which was decent sized and had a great view.  There is a free business center which i used to print copies for a meeting. Free wireless internet throughout the hotel. I complained about a slow drain in the shower and it was fixed in a jiffy. Its surprising how many ppl complain about the decor - the leopard chaise was fine - I actually stayed in a VERY high end hotel in Paris with similar color scheme, including a leopard print chair. I'd have no problem staying here again. The biggest problem is that it lacks any identity. If you want identity, wander down to the Peninsula and fork up $600/night.
