The restaurant was busy (and loud), and we waited about 40 min, not 20 as estimated by the host. Although the host staff was professional and pleasant, the set up in the host stand/cashier area is not well designed-- there was a relentless crowd of people trying to negotiate their way past each other. It was an unpleasant atmosphere, especially with the seemingly required, yet ridiculously loud, bussing technique of THROWING plates into a tub-- 1 out of 5 stars there. Table service also gets 2 out of 5. The server wore a constant scowl, was not pleasant in the least, and was even a bit rude. While I was ordering she interrupted with disdain, "I can't hear you". She also slopped a coffee refill into my mug without asking, which is a big no-no in my opinion. The food however was an excellent 5 out of 5! My scrambled eggs with turkey sausage, mushrooms, and spinach was fresh, cooked perfectly, plentiful, and delicious. My co-diners enjoyed their omelets as well. The grapefruit juice tasted very fresh, and the toast was not burnt at all. I will probably return to Yolk for the food, but not on a Sunday morning!
