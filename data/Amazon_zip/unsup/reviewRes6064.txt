I went here on new year's eve with a group of 14 people, and I initially didn't have high expectations for a steakhouse, but it turned out to be ok. The waitstaff was kind of rude...hard to say whether it was the size of our group, the busy night, they had a bad day, etc? The cocktails were delicious, and our friends enjoyed the beer and wine flights, as well. The Wildorf Salad was really delicious and we split it between 4 people. It was a pretty large salad and could easily be a big meal for someone. Multiple people got steaks which they really enjoyed, and a few of our friends got scallops. The scallops were overcooked and had sand in them, according to my friend. She's not one to complain, so they must have been bad if she mentioned them. I got a veggie burger along with another friend and it was pretty tasty, especially for being at a steakhouse. It was a pretty big portion and so I had to take half home for leftovers. Overall it was an okay restaurant, but the service and some of the dishes were lacking for the prices they charge.
