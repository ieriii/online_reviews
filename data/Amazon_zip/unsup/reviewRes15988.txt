After reading all the fantastic reviews on yelp about Violet Hour, I was prepared for it to be everything I thought it would be.... but it was not. We arrived at 7 and there was already a wait. The host gave us two choices- either sit together in the back, or one person could sit and the bar and the other could stand. I mean, is their bar really that fabulous that one would be willing to stand? The drinks were mediocore and tasted boozy, the music was too loud and the place was for the most part filled with tourists. Bottom line..... go to the W instead.
