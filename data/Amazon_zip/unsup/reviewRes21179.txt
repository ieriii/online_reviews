i absolutely LOVE superdawg. A friend introduced me to this place years ago, and i've recently started going again. I can't believe I survived for so long without it! Their fries are really really good, and their shakes are super thick. I love the black cow (coke with vanilla ice cream), and even though their prices aren't exactly cheap, it's so worth it. Superdawg is a typical drive-in, but they're different because they'll bring a tray out to your car with napkins, ketchup, salt, and all of the food out of the bag and hook it onto the window of your car-- way better than shoving everything into a bag. Best of all? They're open until 2 am on the weekends and 1 am every other night!
