This is a cute little boutique hotel right in the heart of River North that is a wonderful value for the price. I would not say that it should get five stars, because it is certainly not on the caliber with a Peninsula, or another 5 star hotel, but for the cost it is a great value. I enjoy staying at boutique hotels because they offer unique extras: although the Amalfi doesn't have its own bar, they have a complimentary happy hour on weekend nights with wine, limoncello martinis, and bar nibbles. They have cd players with complimentary jazz and world music, cool decor, and a nice sized bathroom. We found our room on expedia for about $150 a night; unbelievably cheap considering the value you receive. It's also right in the middle of many great bars and restaurants. Great place for a fun getaway in the city; it's a nice 3.5 to 4 star hotel for a great price.
