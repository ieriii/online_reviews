Went for Sunday brunch, and even though it was crazy busy, the staff was still friendly and did not let their frustrations show. Its a tad pricey, but the portions are huge and will certainly fill you up. The menu is small but varied and everything my party got was filling and delicious! It gets four stars rather than five though, because i got the weakest bloody mary ever! I tried spicing it up with sriracha and tabasco and pepper to no avail. Stick to the food, its delicious, but this is not the place to get a little hair of the dog.
