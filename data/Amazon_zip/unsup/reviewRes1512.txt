When I was planning my trip to Chicago last this month, I was told... emphatically... by 2 different people to try Hot Doug's. They said that regardless of the line, I absolutely HAD to have a dog from there. So, my last day in town we decide on Hot Doug's for breakfast. Would you believe that at 11am on a Tuesday we had to wait 45 min JUST to get in the door of the restaurant?! I'm telling ya'll... it's THAT good. I gorged myself on the Mountain Man dog - an amazing combination of Elk, Venison, Bison, and Antelope (?) meats encased together to create the best sausage/dog of my LIFE. The meaty masterpiece was topped with a ton of goat cheese (yes!) and a cherry-vodka sauce. Other members of our group had the spicy Salma Hayek, a traditional Chicago dog, an alligator dog topped with gouda & a shrimp remoulade, and the extremely spicy Sonoran dog. Ladies & gentleman... there was not a disappointed stomach in the house. Hot dawgs indeeeeeeed.
