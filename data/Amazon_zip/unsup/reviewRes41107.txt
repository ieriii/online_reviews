Wow, this was pretty awesome. I have to admit, when I booked my Valentine's dinner here, I didn't actually realize the full extent of this place. I think because it's BYOB I didn't expect the super high end, gourmet, prix fix experience. But don't be fooled, this is the real deal. All 8 courses were fantastic, and I'm pretty sure the menu is different all the time, so I suppose it's not worth giving recommendations. But I will say there was a scallop and crab dish with an aioli and heaven knows what else that I've literally been dreaming about. And I know at first my boyfriend was concerned about not being very full, but once course 6 - a fantastic wagu beef dish - came out, he was a fat and happy camper. The place itself is very unique. Unassuming, so much so that it doesn't even have its name out front. Inside there's only about 12 or 15 tables, and it's very comfortable. Service is perfect. They aren't stuffy or overly formal at all, but they do a great job of describing every dish and bringing you more of your BYOB selection, which they keep in back for you. The whole dining experience lasted almost two and a half hours, so plan your BYOB accordingly, and prepare to enjoy yourself! It's obviously a special occasion place, as it is not cheap by any means, but I would highly highly recommend it.
