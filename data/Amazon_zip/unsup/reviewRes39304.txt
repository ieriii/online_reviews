L&E...well, I've only been able to go to Longman and Eagle for brunch. Each time I've gone, it's been pretty tasty. Their items have rotated slightly each time I've been there, but I've gotten mostly scrambles and omelets. THEIR BREAKFAST POTATOES ARE AMAZING. One of the best "breakfast potatoes" I've had. Yum yum yum. Thank you L&E for using green onions in them. One more YUM. One thing I must say - to the reviewer that got a weak bloody mary, I feel sorry for you....you must have had a bad bartender that day. Every time I've gotten one there they've been spicy as heck! But really really yummy. And bone in chicken - isn't that how most fried chicken is served? When Michelin stars are given, the reviewers go to the restaurant for each meal they serve, so if they do brunch and dinner, they will go to both before determining whether or not it receives a star and how many. I am always frustrated about dinner there, though. I've been there at 430 pm and 9 pm, and in between, and it is always a "two hour wait". The hostesses don't even look down at their list. Just "two hours". I've even seen the place full, but where the bar isn't even full (with people drinking or waiting for a table)....and still, two hours. Don't be that pretentious. Use actual times for how long people will have to wait. Or start taking reservations. Or maybe just maybe, they don't like the looks of me. Who knows. OH - a tip for sitting outdoors - the plants in the planters along the wood fence draw bugs big time. So, don't sit in that part of the outdoor seating, or don't sit on the bench by the plants, if you don't want bugs flying all over your meal. I know, you can somewhat expect bugs when sitting outdoors but these were tiny little guys, and swarms of them. Not appetizing. But I'm not going to count that as a negative on them. All that they could do differently is take the darn plants out.
