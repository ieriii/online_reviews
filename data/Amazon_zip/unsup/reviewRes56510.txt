my third review of the night so im not gonna write much lol.quality ingredientsgreat flavorMexican food is good even if the ingredients are not of the highest quality because of all of the flavors compliment eachother at the same time. Also giving each ingredients its own identity if you know what i mean.But frontera really seems to give attention to each ingredient wether it could be using certain techniques to utilize certain ingredients at peak stages (ripe) and taking the time to use these higher quality ingredients to create the pinnacle flavor of mexican cuisine. Surprising to see how they get these ingredients to this level especially in Chicago. Whoever the Chef is, he must care a lot about what he does and i definitely can say im one who appreciates.
