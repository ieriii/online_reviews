This is probably somewhere between four and five stars, but I'm rounding up due to proximity... I live next door. As a runner, I'm always looking for good, cheap pasta. This place definitely hits the spot. All the pasta dishes are really tasty and fresh, and I also highly recommend the spinach salad. Most of the entrees are $10 or less, and I've always had great service. If you're looking to make a night of it, "the other side" bar is next door. Special note: they do not take recommendations and are VERY busy marathon weekend.
