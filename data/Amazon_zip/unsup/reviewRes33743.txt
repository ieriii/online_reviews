I love, love, love this place! I can't name a single other place where you can get good falafel and shwerma (sp?) at such an unbeatable price: $3 for a falafel sandwich, $4 for chicken shwerma, and $2 for the middle eastern version of spinach pie. Seriously, that can't be beat. Although I've never tried it, they have a salad bar that seems fresh and has a lot of variety. They also sell imported packaged goods like figs, almonds, and various dips. Their hot food menu is sparse, but covers the standard middle-eastern fare. My favorite is the chicken shwerma sandwich: a generous portion of seasoned chicken placed in a pita with hummus, Jerusalem salad (which is a mixture of cucumbers, onions, and a light yogurty sauce), and hot sauce. Want more? Order the dinner for only a couple dollars more and you get a larger portion as well as a side of rice. The combination of flavors is excellent and I've never had a bad experience. Even if middle-eastern food is not something you'd typically eat, I'd highly recommend everyone try it at least once.
