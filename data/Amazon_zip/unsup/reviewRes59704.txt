This is the story : I love steak. There is nothing like a great slab of steak to cheer me up. My birthday fell on a busy Thursday night and I did not feel like going out. My best friend planned this whole dinner party at Ruth's Chris Steak House. We went there and we had trouble finding a parking slot. I always order my steak to be cooked medium rare. To my surprise, it was sooo goodddddd! The meat was tender and it made me want more. All my friends had a great time too. Everything was good. The fries were done just right so I was sure that everything was cooked perfectly. We are definitely going back for more steaks and fries.
