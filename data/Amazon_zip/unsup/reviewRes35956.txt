Located in the new Chinatown area, the restaurant is a very different decor to the traditional Chinese restaurants. It's more of an industrial warehouse and quite spacious. You walk in and see the deli work kitchen and by the front window is a roasted pig hanging on a hook and they will cut orders from that. The staff is all very nice and attentive and they are so efficient....they done this so many times. They are famous for their peking duck and you definitely should make reservations, otherwise you will have to wait, unless you get there before 6pm. The Peking duck feast is where they roll out a cart to your table and they carve the duck beautifully in front of you. You get a platter of duck and skin and 6 buns with 3 side dishes of hoison sauce, thinly matchstick carrots and green onions and a dish of pickled vegetables to put into your buns. They take the duck carcass back to the kitchen and later will bring out to you duck fried rice and duck soup. The duck feast is $37.  Ordered extra white buns for $3.50 and it was worth it because we had leftovers for the next day. I've been to many Chinese banquets and eaten Peking duck lots in the USA, but I have to say that this is the BEST!!! It had crispy skin and tender meat and so delicious!  The beef chow fun noodles and Chinese brococoli were both delicious and one of the BEST I've had. The won ton soup was very good too, but I found the broth a bit salty for me. If you like Chinese food and especially Peking duck, this is a definite must go to place to eat in Chicago.
