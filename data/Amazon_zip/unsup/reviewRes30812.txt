Mastros my new favorite steakhouse with ambiance to boot. While I have encountered a few nay-sayers but I have found a fool proof way to enjoy Tip 1: Always sit in the bar Every night they have live music: piano and vocals. They play everything from Adele to Billy Joel to Lady Gaga and with the crowd there it is hard not to have fun. The bar area has bar stools, high tops, and banquettes available. If you want a table (hightop or banquette), make a reservation! The main dining room areas are nice but can be a little stuffy. Nothing like a lively bar scene to distract you from a long day Tip 2: Be Ready to Drink The martinis may be some of the most expensive in the city but you get more than enough to do the trick. The shaker always has plenty extra (think another 50% or so) Tip 3: Vegan? Probably Not Your Spot The menu is very seafood and beef heavy and butter and dairy cover the rest. Aside from the sides, options are very limited for true vegans. (The Gorgonzola Mac will satisfy any vegetarian)  Still a great spot to have drinks but Tip 4: Try The Sides The roasted brussel sprouts (cooked in olive oil), gorgonzola mac, and truffled gnocchi are to die for.  The macaroni also makes a delicious breakfast so it is okay to have left overs. One other tip? The lobster mashed potatoes are amazing but I have them serve the lobster(and sauce) separate from the potatoes. IT keeps the lobster from continuing to cook and I only eat the potatoes as a lobster delivery device so I don't feel too bad not finishing them. Tip 5: There Is Always Room For Butter Cake Not sure if you are feeling dessert? Are you more of a chocolate person? Too bad- trust me on this: the butter cake is nothing short of a heavenly experience. The heavy cream they serve with it? Its as thick as ice cream and not overly-sweet Definitely worth a visit
