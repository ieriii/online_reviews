One of my favorite bars on the North Side. The beer selection is unbelievable, prices reasonable, and the atmosphere is fun to boot. Only gripe, of course, is that a place this good gets crowded, FAST. If you're going on a weekend night, go early. There's more seating upstairs but the selection is slightly more limited--50+ varieties of bottles available, but nothing on tap, and they don't take credit cards. I've never gone for the food so I can't comment on that!
