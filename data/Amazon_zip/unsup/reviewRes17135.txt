Went last Thursday around 7pm for the first time. No lines and got seated right away.  Decor is different and whimsical. I didn't have rude service as others have mentioned.  Drinks are nice (they should be at $12 a pop) but I had to leave after one because the music was so incredibly horrible and was giving me a headache. Not sure what track they were playing but it was a depressing moaning old white lady and not anything to go along with the happy mood the drink was putting me in. Sorry for whoever was depressed that night and picked out the music but it really sucked.  Put on more of an upbeat lounge-y tune to go along with the booze and maybe I'd stay a while.
