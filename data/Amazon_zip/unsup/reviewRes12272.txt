After trying out Windy City CrossFit nearby, three of us strolled over to Cafe28 around noon on a Saturday. We were immediately seated, and managed to beat the lunch crew which filled up maybe 20 minutes after we were seated. Solid food! After working out, sharing the Taste of Cuba was delicious...and then I REALLY enjoyed my Chilaquiles. Note: the chicken is not cut up into the dish itself, and instead a whole chicken breast is served on the side. I must go back for the pork chops.
