I went here last weekend with Kris Williams. My eyes tend to be bigger than my stomach most times. I order whatever looks good even if they don't pair perfectly. On Saturday, I ordered the Avocado + Smoked Gouda sandwich with no mustard. As many other Yelpers before me have said, this is one tasty sandwich. I also ordered a salad special they had which was spinach with melted goat cheese drizzled on top. It sounded dreamy and tasted pretty delicious but the melted goat cheese had a gritty texture that appeared when I was chewing it. It kind of weirded me out, but yeah, it tasted good. I have to go against the Yelp grain and agree with Baji K, the chips were not good. They are thick and kettle-cooked and they sure look appealing, but when it came down to it, they were tasteless. Kris Williams agreed, but I joked with her that when I brought them home, Zachary would love them (he did). I sampled the huevos rancheros and the yogurt and granola Kris got. They were pretty good, but I wasn't blown away. There are already so many great breakfast spots in our neck of the woods that I don't feel like waiting in a line if it's not Toast or Bongo Room. Both of those restaurants have proved themselves to me time and time again, but Milk & Honey Cafe, you haven't won me over. Also, what compels Milk & Honey to stay in this awkward skinny space that is always packed on weekends?
