I heard much about Hot Doug's and after visiting, they did not disappoint. I tried their celebrity special which was a hot dog with apple embedded within the dog with blue cheese and honey on top. Despite the bizarre sounding combo, it was rich in flavor and left me wanting more. Their original fries are fantastic and I highly recommend them. The only reason why this place is not a 5 star spot in my opinion was the 45 minute wait. But if you can afford the time, I highly recommend visiting this Chicago hotspot.
