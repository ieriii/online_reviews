Right up front I'm going to admit that I am germaphobic. So I never (ever) lick my fingers after eating anything really... even fried chicken. However, after having the Seoul Sassy chicken at Crisp my fingers were all up in there! Its just soooooooooooo good! I mean ... soooooooooooooooooooooo gooooooooooooooood. I'm seriously salivating right now thinking about it. *takes a moment* Okay, so since then I have tried their steak sandwich, which is weird and messy but really good. I get it with the cheese and stuff. However, my favorite at the moment is their baby buddha bowl. Its just full of deliciousness. Lots of zucchini and spinach and sprouts and I usually get steak added to it and ask for a side of Seoul Sassy sauce... and then I add a bit of Al's Atomic sauce... and it comes with an egg on top and the yolk oozes down and mixes with everything ... what? Its perfect that way I swear!! Their onion rings are pretty tasty too. Sweet for some reason *shrugs* but enjoyable... but if you get a bowl you won't have room for anything else... and if you get a half chicken you'll find yourself going back for the other half... I also love that you can get Diet Dr. Pepper there :D that just makes it perfect by my standards.
