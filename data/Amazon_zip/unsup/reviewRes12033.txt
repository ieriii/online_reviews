Great food and great service... And it's been that way for years. The Halibut is always good and has remained on the menu for a long time. They have had various good steaks on the menu over the years. And it may seem silly, but they have the best butter on the planet. The staff is top-notch from the bartenders to the hostesses to the servers to the bus boys. We have had a couple parties here (birthday and wedding shower) and everyone raves about the food and service. I think the menu has a little something for everyone as well. If you are scared off by the unfamiliarity of Cuban food, don't be. It is also quite American. It's my favorite reasonably priced restaurant in Chicago. Keep up the good work Cafe 28.
