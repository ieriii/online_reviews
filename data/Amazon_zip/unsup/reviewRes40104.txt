That restaurant's food was okay. But I really do not like some of waitress's service, they have never been nice like so rude. Never smile,always rush, do not speak english etc so many bad thinkgs! Every weekend they do very busy so they do not care customer care! One time after I paid waitress lady asked me about Tip.., I was feeling like...!!!! So so so ridiculous. Never go there again
