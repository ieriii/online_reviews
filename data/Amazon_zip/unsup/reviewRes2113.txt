I hadn't been here in over a year. But nothing's changed, and that's the best compliment for this place. I had the "Smoked Shrimp and Pork Sausage with Cajun Tartar Sauce and Fontina Cheese" and it blew my mind. The shrimp added an element that kept the pork sausage interesting. Don't get me wrong! I'm just saying that having two meats with such complementary flavors worked like magic. Kinda like a jambalaya dog, I guess.
