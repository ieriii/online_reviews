All oysters and pigs should aspire to one day end up on a plate at the Publican (and preferably in my tummy). This place is legit!! I've been wanting to try this place for quite some time and I'm so happy I finally did. Paul Kahan has amazed me once again. I have zero negative comment about my experience here. Everyone from the hostess, to the busboys, to our waiter was just terrific. Our server was super helpful and offered great suggestions, especially when trying to pick beers to pair with the food. The beer list is extensive, overwhelming, and phenomenal. The food is "tapas style" and communal, which is a plus because you get to have a little bit of everything. We ordered about four plates (which for two people means a full out food coma). The oysters were my favorite. It tasted exactly like oysters should taste: simple, fresh, and ocean tasting. It doesn't need the cocktail sauce nonsense like oysters at other restaurants need. The frites with the eggs on top were to die for. It just further solidified my theory: a fried egg on top of anything will make anything and everything taste awesome. Everything else was well put together. The food is simple and focuses on three things: pork, fish, and beer. The flavors were simple, but very hearty, very savory. Everything is organic, and you can definitely taste the difference. I really enjoyed the atmosphere of the restaurant as well. It was a lot less pretentious and more laid back than I expected. Most people are seating at a long communal table, which can be fun-but if you're looking for a more private, intimate setting, make reservations for one of their super awesome looking booths. The place itself has a little bit of a masculine feel; it looks like a winter lodge in St. Moritz, except with giant pictures of pigs that adorn the wall. I cannot rave enough about the Publican. I want to stop writing this review and go back...now.
