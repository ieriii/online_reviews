Went here for bunch wanted to try something new...and new it definitely was. I enjoed the chicken sausage and the cranberry mimosa...pancakes not great and the home potatoes were basically roasted potaoes no onion or green pepper in them. I wont be coming back for brunch but maybe I will give it another try for dinner or lunch.
