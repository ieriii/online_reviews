Rick Bayless + Street Food + Sandwiches + fresh made limeade = a total win for everyone involved. My recommendation is go on thursday. The special of the day is an outstanding Mole Torta that literally made me melt in my seat it was so delicious. I'm sure that I'm not saying anything that people haven't already said; but the churros, which are made fresh, are AMAZING! Hello! I'm not only going back, I'm trying to think of reasons I can go as often as possible.
