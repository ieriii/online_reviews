I *love* this pizza place :) I don't like deep dish pizza (the roomie raves about it though) but the pan is my favorite (we took turns ordering it). I ate it every week during football season. I'm from Ohio and it reminds me of my favorite pizza back home. The crust is good, the sauce is good (not too much, not too little) and the toppings are great (we usually get pepperoni and/or sausage ~ boring but I love it that way!) We got it to go (I live right up the street on Webster) but the few times I've eaten in, the service was decent. The appetizers and salad are also good but I didn't care for the pasta dishes.
