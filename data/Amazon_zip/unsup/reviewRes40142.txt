Had a great experience here. The hostess was exceptionally friendly. The look/feel of the place is nice; nothing that will really blow you away. We had a few drinks (the Scotch/Whiskey/Bourbon list is worth a gander). They have some decent beer on tap an din bottle. It is no Hop Leaf, but you 'll be able to find i micro or something main stream whatever fits you tastes. The food was great. We had the pretzel, vegetarian corn risotto, seared scallops, and duck rillettes. I definitely recommend ordering a few plates to share. That food+2 beers+the Koval flight+a glas of scotch= $78ish total. A bit pricey but unique.  My main reason for the high rating is that we were quite slow, but I did not for one second feel rushed or like the wait staff was trying to get us out of there in a hurry. We sat outside (quieter if you're looking to have a good conversation).  All in all it's a good place. Gastro-pub that didn't feel pretentious.
