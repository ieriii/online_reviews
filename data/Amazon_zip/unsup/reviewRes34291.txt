My boyfriend and I decided to go to Mia Francesca on a random Friday night. We didn't have reservations, but we agreed to sit at the bar in the back little coach house. The bartender/ waiter was very accommodating; however, there was a lot of confusion about seating. We were wedged between another couple and the end of the bar. The waiter wasn't able to pass through, so he moved us down even close to the couple. Totally not his fault, but I wish the host would have just told us to wait until someone sitting at the bar was finished. The waiter/ bartender recommended an excellent red wine. My boyfriend ordered the ravioli, which was absolutely delicious. I ordered a linguine dish with pancetta and onions. My food was so so. I definitely could have prepared it at home myself, which is kind of disappointing. I would go back to Mia Francesca. But I would know what to order and definitely call for reservations.
