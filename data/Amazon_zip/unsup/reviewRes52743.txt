I am definitely a fan of 90 Miles. I have been to both locations now, and have had a great experience each time. When I went to the smaller location in Roscoe, I ordered empanadas and a Cubano sandwich. Both were delicious (get the guava and goat cheese empanadas they are perfection). Last night I went to the Logan Square location with a friend who had never been. The waiter was really nice and explained the menu thoroughly. I had the veggie plate and while my portobello mushroom was a but overdone, it was still really good. What is fun about 90 Miles is that it is BYOB and the atmosphere is perfect for a summer night out. Bring a bottle, take some shots, eat some food, enjoy the music, and make new friends--You've done it right.
