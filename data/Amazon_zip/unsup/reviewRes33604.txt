Love it. Place is so cute!!! Garage parking is about $7. I had the butcher shop omelet -- it was great. I think it could have used a bit more cheese, but it was so good! Instead of toast, I opted for chocolate chip pancakes with strawberries for an extra measly $1.50. Their freshly squeezed OJ with strawberry is a must have. I can''t wait to come back. There are lots of other things I'd like to try. Get there early and say you want first available seating. Seems like the wait goes by faster!
