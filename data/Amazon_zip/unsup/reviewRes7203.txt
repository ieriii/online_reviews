I'm crazy about q! The food is excellent and the look and feel of the space is a refreshing design twist on Southern BBQ style. From the photography and beautiful wood floors to the furniture and staff's uniforms. Every detail is considered in this 5 star dining experience! Great for dates or large groups. Big into: "Competition" St. Louis Full Slab, Mac and Cheese, Hush Puppies, Pulled Pork Sandwich, Martinis and beer list But I recommend letting the staff guide your drink and meal choices.
