Just Grate Steak!!!!They made us wait for 45 min,but than they comp apps 25$ and 25$ for drinks,nice of them,but after that I didn't see the manager any more I didn't need too because food was so good,we had porterhouse steak for 2 and lobster mash potato it was spot on,5 stars for food!!We both bottle of wine at the bar so server didn't care about us any more,again she didn't have to but if you spend 300$ for diner I was expecting little bit better service!!!Over all I will be back!!!
