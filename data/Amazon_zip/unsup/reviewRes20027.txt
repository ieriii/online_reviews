In order to review XOCO, that would imply I would have been waited on and seated during my lunch hour this Wednesday (as in a non-important or busy day). However, since that didn't happen within an HOUR of waiting in a long line out the door being bumped and hassled and excuse'd me one too many times, my boss finally gave up and we left.  The food may be stellar, and knowing Rick's other restaurants, I'd bet that it is. But operationally, this restaurant is a cluster muck and is definitely not scalable. Boo.
