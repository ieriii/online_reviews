I like the food at Bongo Room, but I have a personal rule against standing in line for food unless it's phenomenal. So we went early to beat the rush. Food was good, but the server dropped our check halfway through our meal, then nobody picked up our empty plates until I put down my card. Call me picky, but if I'm going to spend $50 on breakfast, and I'm not at Sunrise or some other greasy spoon, I expect the experience to be like going to a regular restaurant. Inattentive service and rushing people out the door is not cool for the money. We won't be back
