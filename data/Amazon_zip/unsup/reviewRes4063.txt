My wife and I made it to Schwa last Friday evening after a long time looking forward to it. It was nothing short of spectacular. I went in with high expectations, and they totally blew me away. The menu consisted of 1.) Grapefruit-Black Truffle Amuse 2.) Hendrick's Gin Salad with cucumber gelee and gin/rosewater granita 3.) French Onion Soup with brioche topped with melted Gruyere. 4.) Jellyfish Pad Thai 5.) Off Menu Quail Egg Ravioli with shaved white truffle on top. 6.) Whitefish roe with black garlic and bacon puree and poached asparagus 7.) Kobia in red pepper couscous with watermelon juice. 8.) Morels and Lamb Brains 9.) Sous-vide rabbit with rabbit rillette and kidney 10.) Green curry and rootbeer cone 11.) Cheese course 12.) Parsnip custard, maple syrup and lavender foam with passionfruit and candied sweetbreads. Highlights were the jellyfish pad thai, the rabbit rillette, the brioche with gruyere, and finally the ravioli, which as far as I remember, was the best thing that I have eaten. Chef Carlson brought out the white truffle and showed it off like a kid showing off his new bike. His enthusiasm for his food is clear as is his talent preparing it. We swapped some wine with the table next to us, facilitated by Chef Carlson. We had a spectacular time and look forward to returning.
