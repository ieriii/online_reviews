So it's St. Patty's day. Everyone is either going to the parade or most likely drinking green beer or Guinness. So what do we do? Go to Chinatown! I randomly found this place on Yelp a while back and not really sure how. All I knew was that I must eat here. We arrived around 5:30 and had to wait 5 minutes. Instead of taking your name, they write how many people in your party next to a number. Great idea if you ask me. Easier to say the number then names! We waited for a brief time and got seated. I knew I wanted hot pot and talked the hubs into getting it with me as well. Foolishly, we ordered the hot and spicy. The amount of food we got was insane. There were veggies, seafood, fish as well as lamb and beef. I am not familiar with how hot pot works so we needed a lesson from the server. She made a delicious sauce for us combining the three together. This is similar to fondue but Chinese style. Each item has a cooking time but the lamb and beef literally take seconds. You dip it in the boiling broth and out it comes. Everything was delicious except the fish balls. Not a fan of those.  Everything on the menu is spicy as they dedicate one small area titled non spicy items. This is definitely my kind of place. My next meal here is going to be the Mapo tofu. That just looks delicious.
