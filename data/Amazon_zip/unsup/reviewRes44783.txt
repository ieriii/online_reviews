Deep-dish Pizza is what you get when you have Irish immigrants try their hands at making pizza. It is the bastard child of a savory pie traditional of the Irish, British, and Scots with the flavor and ingredients of Italy. Deep-dish pizza flirts with its identity and pushes the definition of what is pizza to its absolute limits and is by far the most unique of all the styles of pizza one commonly finds. Even the crust is more like pie crust in texture and flavor then anything remotely like any other pizza you've had. It so happens that the crust is absolutely the best part of Giordano's pie. Sadly, the sauce is dense, sweet, and more reminiscent than I'd like to canned tomato paste. The cheese and toppings are fairly average. The whole experience is also pleasantly less greasy than one would expect. Giordano's fancies itself as the pinnacle of deep-dish Pizza. It's good, not great and certainly not fancy or gourmet. The flavors were also not unique or striking and bore a little too much similarity to the deep dish pizza at the national chain Uno Chicago Grill for me to get too excited about it. You could do worse, but I find it hard to believe there's not somewhere with a much better deep-dish pizza. Perhaps next time I am in Chicago, I'll find it.
