I like. As far as the place and the food is concerned, I think a 4 is appropriate. To be fair, I did have high expectation b/c of its "sister" restaurants, avec and blackbird, both of which-esp. avec--are better. However, I really liked the service, and that's the icing. I just went there for my husband's birthday, and apparently the server (the guy w/dreads) overheard us say something about his birthday and put a lit candle on our dessert (so sweet!). We also tried a lot of things and had changes yet he remembered everything w/out us even repeating it (though he had about 4 words on his pad). Anyway, the inside is pretty cool. They probably chopped down a forest to fashion this restaurant, but I still like it. LOVED the char on bread, my fries were just ok (but I guess you can only expect so much from fries, the mussels were pretty good (though the sauce they were served in was delicious and they gave you break to soak it up), and, what I waited for the entire night, the dessert waffle w/blueberries and honey butter (that's not completely true, I wanted the eclair but it was my husband's bday so he got to choose)was...meh. I would have given the place a 9 (I wish yelp started doing things out of 10), but I'm rounding up.
