this is my favorite restaurant in chicago. the atmosphere is intimate, the wine selection is excellent. the fondue here is top notch. never ever had a bad meal here. love the service, if it's a special occasion make sure you let them know, they will go out of their way to accommodate you. this place is a gem in chicago.
