Superdawg is iconic in Chicago. This is funny because it barely seems like Superdawg is IN Chicago. To get there, you've gotta drive north forever, past weird neighborhoods that reek of potatoes and pride, past boarded up storefronts and small side-streets with slummy looking apartments and gas stations advertising 'Cheep beer and lottorey.' Once you get there, though, you know it. It's very suburban-ish. Laid back. Giant hot dog characters in the roof. It's a drive-in, which is foreign to a lot of people in this day and age. You park, you press the buzzer. A box asks you what you'd like to eat. You're at Superdawg, so naturally, you order a Superdawg. 30 minutes later, a haggard looking lady who's seen a thing or two comes to your car and hands you your food. The Superdawg comes in a collapsible box and is buried beneath a fistful of lackluster crinkle-cut fries (it's not Superdawg's fault-- crinkle-cut fries are just pretty awful by nature). The Superdawg itself, though, is delightful. It's fat and juicy, topped with mustard, neon green relish, tomato-wedge, celery salt, diced onion, and if you're feeling wild, hot peppers. It's hot and sloppy (my favorite strip club, by the way) and you'll end up spilling most of it down the front of your shirt. Note to teens: Do not go to Superdawg before prom. Anyway, you eat the 'dawg and you head back to the city. You sleep it off, like a bottle of bourbon or a prizefight you trained poorly for. You wake up and you have that weird feeling that you get after a nap, where it feels like whatever you did before the nap happened a different day. You wake up and spend the rest of your Saturday evening watching Footloose. It's just a Footlose kinda day, I guess.
