Good food, great atmosphere, wonderful beer and an attentive staff. Having said that, as my wife said it kind of felt like an "overpriced turkey."  The sweetbreads seemed tasteless to me, but really enjoyed the flavoring and texture of the pork belly and the pork rinds were light and fluffy.  The cost of all this seemed very high though. I had a beer and my wife had only water and we were still spending around 90 for the two of us (no dessert either).
