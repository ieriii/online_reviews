Yum! I had a great experience my first time at Cafe 28. Stopped in for an early dinner at 6:00 on a Saturday nite. We were seated right away-without reservations--however, the place filled up very quickly after that. The porkchops on the dinner menu were AWESOME. Spicy, sweet thick sauce, tasty mashed sweet potatoes. Mmmmm Mmmm! The steak was also delicious.  The atmosphere was nice--a mix of couples, families and some party people. Service was good.  I would recommend making reservations if you decide to go.  There were a ton of people waiting in the small bar area when we were leaving.
