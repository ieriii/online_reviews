My current review list of churrascarias: #1 Tastiest meat on the planet: Texas de Brazil #2 The original, superb in every way: Fogo de Chao #3 Finest service out of the bunch, food a little bland: Brazzaz #4 Good but forgettable: Sal & Carvao #? Horrible in every way. Will never go back: ZED451. Eat Taco Bell. The food at Texas de Brazil was bar-none the best and perfectly seasoned to my tastes. Some may say it's a bit salty but I love how the sea salt they use bring the juices to the top. I also love how the sea salt crusts on the outer ends of the meat. Absolutely delectable. I wasn't impressed by the lack of valet parking or the so-so service, but after tasting the house special sirloin, they could have kicked me in the face and I still would go back to Texas de Brazil. Fogo de Chao is great for both food and service. You can't really go wrong with Fogo as the food is also quite good. It is the perfect blend of those that don't want their meats overly seasoned and those that don't want it too bland. Brazzaz's steaks are a little bland. Don't get me wrong, they are still very very delicious but I like how Texas de Brazil seasons their meats so that they penetrate right into the meat and juices instead of me pouring salt on top every time I get a new cut. Service here, however, made me feel like a king.
