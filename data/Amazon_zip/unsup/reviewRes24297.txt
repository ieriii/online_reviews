Fan f-ing tastic. We made an order for carry-out and when we got back, they had given me a steak sandwich instead of a veggie. Since I live right by, they delivered my new veggie sandwich super quick and put in an order of free plantains with a little note that said, sorry for our error, enjoy! I seriously almost cried! That is the nicest thing ANY delivery/carry out place in Chicago has ever done. Normally it takes forever, and you question whether or not they spit in it. They even let my meat-lovin boyfriend keep the other mistake sandwich. Besides that, like I said, this place is fan-f-ing tastic! My veggie sandwich was loaded with veggies and delicious. We also got the spicy guacamole which was fabulous and I got a side of yellow rice, which was also scrumcious. My meal was completely satisfying and I don't think any place could have been nicer about the mixed up order. They have seating both inside and out and they only except cash- FYI. They do have an ATM inside though. I will definitely be going back- thanks IRAZU for redeeming yourself from the sandwich mix up :)
