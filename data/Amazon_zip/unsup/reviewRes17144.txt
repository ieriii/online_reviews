First and foremost, you have to go here with the right frame of mind. Violet Hour is not really about drinks, it's about people. It is an intimate setting, good for groups of two or four people, max. It's not a place you go "to drink." It's a place you go to relax and enjoy a drink, maybe two (more if you have unlimited funding). There's no TVs, there's no distractions - it's just you and whoever you're with. The way they arrange the space makes it feel comfortable and relaxed - you're not right on top of the next table - you feel like you have your own space. We went during an "off peak" time and didn't have to wait very long. We spent an hour and a half and had two drinks. We were never made to feel rushed. The drinks were delicious, well made, and when I asked about one I had seen on the online menu but not in print, the server knew exactly which one I was referring to and said they could make it anyway. He was attentive, but not intrusive. The Violet Hour is perfect for what it is.
