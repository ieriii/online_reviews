My boyfriend and I go to different restaurants around Chicago to taste new things out. We had heard great things about this place, so on a warm summer day we made our way to Irazu. We sat ourselves on the patio and waited to be waited on, and we waited. After of what seemed like forever, but was only about 15 mins, our order was taken. We waited for our food in the sizzling sun for way longer than expect 25 mins later the food finally came. While eating I went to pick at my boyfriends food, which he had barely touched, and spotted a disgusting hair in it. I was both disgusted and furious. I completely lost my hunger. We again waited for a waiter to make them aware of my dissatisfaction. The waiter noticed me looking around and came over and asked if all was well. I explained to him the situation and took the plate and said he would bring another one. I was so angry and disgusted that after that I wanted nothing but to leave. After the plate was taken and taken off our bill we had 3 different waiters how we liked the food. What was there to like? What did they mean how do we like our food? We barely got to taste it! Quick question shouldn't the chef be wearing hair nets? Overall the service was awful. The food was, well let's say a hairy topic. And the parking was impossible.
