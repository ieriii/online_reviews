I have mixed feelings about Greek islands. I have been there a few times for lunch only having the appetizers. Which are great. Cold calamari and shrimp Grilled octopus are by far the best. Don't go here without trying the octopus. Went here the other night for dinner with a group. They do not take reservations after 6pm on weekends, which is annoying. But we got in relatively quickly. Service was top notch, our waiter was great. After some great appetizers, I was underwhelmed by dinner. Meat was over cooked, and the sauces were almost inedibly salty. Dessert was out of stock. We ended up with baklava, which was stale and dry tasting, and some Greek cake thing.
