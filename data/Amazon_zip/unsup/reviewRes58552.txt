Last night I went to Spacca Napoli with the Windy City Pizza Club at 6pm. My very first thought as we walked around the corner outside the restaurant was wow this place is huge and looks really nice inside! When we walked in the door we were greeted immediately by the owner and then seated right away. Sure enough I was right, the restaurant had an Italian feel to it, with lots of tables and lighting. There was another large group sitting next to our table, but it didn't even seem crowded because there was plenty of space. Our server was great and very friendly. The pizza only take 3-5 minutes to bake, so they come out very fast. My favorite part of the restaurant is of course the pizza. I shared the Bufalina pizza which is Basil, Mozzarella di bufala and Olive Oil with my sister. We both thought it was delicious and very flavorful! The crust was soft and perfectly baked (just the way I like it). Depending on your appetite, you could definitely get away with ordering your own pizza since it's very thin pizza or share 2 pizzas with someone so that you get more than one of their great options!I would definitely go back to Spacca Napoli. It's a great date place and though I didn't drink, I noticed that the wine price list was very reasonable. Thank you to Spacca Napoli's owner for providing the Windy City Pizza Club with a great evening!
