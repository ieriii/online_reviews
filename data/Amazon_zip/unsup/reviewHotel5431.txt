Yes I am giving this place a 4 star review. No, not because it one of the nicer places I've stayed but because of the whole experience itself. Yes, the elevator is a tad sketchy being the fact that it takes an unusual amount of time for it to even start moving once youre in it. But i did have locks on the door and while being peg-legged the receptionist was very friendly, let us look at the room before we checked in and let us know what we were in for. I did put my own sheets on the bed and wore shoes almost all the time. I liked the charm of the place plugs cut off of all the electrical devices in the room and all. My only complaint I have about the place is the creepy guy who lives on the 14th floor right around the corner from the room we had and right across the hall from the elevator...he likes to sit with his door ajar on a chair in the corner of his room only wearing his tidy whiteys and just stares out the door. While being creepy he didnt bother with us at all. Some might say it was not the safest decision for 2 eighteen/ninteeen year old girls but was the only place in/around the city where you didnt have to be 21 to check in and was at a decent price and its nice they dont jack up the rates for Lollapalooza like every single other hotel/motel in the area. I would recommend Tokyo Hotel to a person whos willing to experience something a tad out of the ordinary or if youre just as broke as I was and desperately needed somewhere to stay for a weekend.
