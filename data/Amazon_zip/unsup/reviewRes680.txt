If you can save your cash and justify a meal for the ages then call and make the rez. Alinea will not dissapoint.  Do your homework, if you must but this is a WORLD CLASS dining experiance. I consider myself fortunate not only to have eaten at Alinea but dually fortunate to have such a place in my city.
