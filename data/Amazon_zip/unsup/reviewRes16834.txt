This is a stretch to 4 stars, but I've been to Carnivale twice and the bottom line is it's a good restaurant experience and a fun night out. So what if the food and service are not selling points? The real selling point is the decor -- you have to see it for yourself. Food is tasty but nothing I've had was inspiring. Generous portions, and high prices, are the norm. There is plenty of live music, dancing, and special events if you care to check them out. And the girls always rave about the drinks.
