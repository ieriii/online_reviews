Excellent food and beers. Somewhere outside planets must be aligning. Astro Joe can you confirm that? The Gage is a swanky little refuge from the tourists of Millennium park right on South Michigan Ave. They fancy themselves a gastropub and they certainly deliver on that. Their menu is creative, although it may be a bit overwhelming for the less adventurous types. However, there should be some variation of a stock option to suit your palate. They have tweaked their menu since the last time we were in, sadly the snacks have not changed and still seem bunk to me. I took advantage of the new items and got the BBQ turkey sandwich with caramelized onions and grainy mustard on a tasty pretzel roll like you'd find in Bavaria. Pretty damn good. Other noteworthy items on the list are the Fire Roasted Chicken, Fish and chips and the Gage Burger. Please don't cook that past Medium Rare and enjoy it with some of those great chips. The brunch menu looks good too, but I have not had anything from it yet. They have an impressive selection of beers on tap. Usually a few Germans to be had and about the only place I've seen New Belgium seasonals. Why yes, I'll have another pint. The place reminds me of an old bathhouse, which seems fitting. During the busy weekends people can be stacked right on you. Service has always been great and they seem to have a bunch of managers keeping things running smoothly. They drop by every visit to see how we are doing. Very well as you are. Love the Gage, cheers.
