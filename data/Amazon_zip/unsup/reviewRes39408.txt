Oh Longman, how Iove thee!!! Although we've been here at least 10 times, recently it has been mostly for brunch, due to the long waits... Brunch does not disappoint though and I love that they are always sprinkling in some new dishes while keeping my favorites :) We love the duck hash, strada and the crab Benedict as some of the staples that are always no the menu. The cure to any hangover is the pork belly blt, that amount of fat can help any amount of alcohol consumption. Fries for breakfast? Sure! I don't want to stand in line for 2 hours for dinner, so you have to satisfy that craving in some way. My parents also LOVE this restaurant and have before patiently waited for over 2 hours to be seated :) Of course, fantastic whiskey drink do help in the wait... We will be coming back over and over again, just hope that other people choose not to so the lines aren't as long... Not sure why I am writing this review then... Please do not come here with kids or with parties of more then 6 people. We came here once with 6 people on a Tuesday at about 6 pm to a 2 hour wait...
