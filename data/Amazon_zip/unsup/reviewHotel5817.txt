This Marriott could be described easily: simple. There wasn't anything that stood out about this Marriott as great or awful (except Chicago traffic- zing!).It was comfortable during my stay, and my only two complaints were that my Platinum upgrade was WEAK and that valet parking is required. That's probably to keep unauthorized people parking there though.I wouldn't go out of my way to stay here, but I would again if my business was close by.
