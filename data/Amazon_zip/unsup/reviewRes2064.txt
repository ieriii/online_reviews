Back to Doug's again, this time met a pretty fast moving line. Had a veg dog with the Cherry-Blackberry Cream Sauce and Sartori Raspberry Cheese topping. Shared the vinegar tots with my friends. We were in and out with a quickness. Perfect lunch with an added gourmet topping touch! Can you say delish?!?!
