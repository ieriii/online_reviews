I feel a little like the kid in the children's' story "The Emperor's New Clothes." PEOPLE! THIS IS NOT GREAT BARBECUE!!  The place is exceptionally beautiful- fantastic building, decor, and ambiance. The chips and pickles on the tables and the guy who promptly refills the dishes as you stuff your faces...great. But, the BEST part of a meal shouldn't be the beginning!! The food was ok. And that's an average between the ribs that were good- not great- and the brisket sandwich that was inedible. Pulled pork was more than could be eaten on a bun but mixed in were pieces so tough and dry. It was like eating fish with bones- hard to enjoy because you're having to pick thru and risk having something unchewable in your mouth. (The tough parts weren't that wonderful crispy crust of real BBQ- just hunks/chards of dried out end pieces.) Flavors were weak- sauces were anything except bold-very one dimensional and not the complex flavors of well made sauce. Portions were HUGE but really a lot of something that's not great is still not great.  IF YOU GO: Portions are large enough to share 1 plate w 2 ppl. Avoid the brisket- the words Kobe and BBQ don't go together. Brisket on platter was fair to okay- chopped brisket on sandwich was left behind after 2 bites by the big man who eats anything. Never saw that before. IF YOU WANT BARBECUE: Go to Smoque or Lillie's or hop the train to Lagrange and eat at Que. You wont find candles or cloth napkins and you'll have to order at a counter. We don't know which one of these places has the best meat and sides so we'll keep going back to Lillie's, Smoque, and Que(Lagrange) til we figure it out.
