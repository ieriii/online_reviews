True, if you like the Cheesecake Factory you probably will like Grand Lux, just by chance I am not much of a fan of the Cheesecake Factory. You can blame McDonald's all you want for obesity in America but places like this do deserve some credit. Their portions are astronomically big and really nothing special. The seafood salad probably contained two heads of lettuce with toppings on top. I got the dressing on the side, that came in a gravy pitcher pouring mechanism. Imagine if all the dressing was actually on the salad. Good fast service, with constant refills of drinks. If gluttony is your bag, this place is right up your alley.
