I've been there twice once inside when it was quiet and once outside when it was busy. Quiet was better. This place gets raves so when its busy they struggle because they are a small restaurant. Once you're in stretch your compfort zone and order bone marrow, pork liver pate & pork neck-bone rillette as appetizers. For larger plates try the pigs tails, pork shoulder and ham & duck eggs. This new spot from the family that brought you Heaven on Seven's cajun fare now rides the wave of lesser used cuts of meat and proves you can make a silk purse out of a sows ear.
