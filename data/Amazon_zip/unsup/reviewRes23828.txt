I happen to think this is one of the most amazing Chinese places ever, one of my clients who is a chinese interpreter said it is some of the best and most authentic regional chinese outside of China, I've never been but Im going to have to take his word on that. Szechuan food is generally thought to be really spicy and Lao Sze Chuan wont let you down. One of my favorite dishes is the dry chili chicken HOT but that perfect kind of hot. Some of my friends aren't really into spicy stuff and they didn't have any problems finding items that weren't to overwhelming. Im officially addicted!
