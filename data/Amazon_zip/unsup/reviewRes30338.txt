It pains me to give Chicago Diner a mediocre review. A vegan-friendly all vegetarian restaurant with tons of selection? I want to love this place but I just don't. First of all they seem to never have a designated host, or maybe the person just isn't doing their job because every time I come here I end up standing around awkwardly between tables for a long time waiting for someone to write my name down (have never been here when there isn't a long wait). As for the food the only thing I have LOVED here was the bbq bacon cheeseburger, but I have tried a lot of dishes here and nothing else has been great. The vegan mac and cheese was nasty, and believe it or not yummy vegan mac and cheese does exist. Once when I came here our sides came out soaked in vinegar- it was like someone had accidentally spilled a bottle of vinegar all over our plates, super strange and gross. They replaced the sides but didn't comp our meal or anything. Also I've had them make replacements without asking first. I would still come back here and get the bbq bacon cheeseburger, but really I never end up going unless I have a veg guest in town who wants to go.
