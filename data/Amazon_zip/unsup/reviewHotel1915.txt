This is a review of the room service and for screwing up my check in / bill. The room service is AWFUL. Your food will take 90 minutes when they tell you 40.  You ask for fresh veggies and you ask them what they have? They say its seasonal mixed. Your entree FINALLY shows up 90 minutes later.....and shows up with no veggies. You call down, and they come back with an entire bowl of brussel sprouts ANOTHER 40 MINUTES later. I kid you not. Whole bowl of brussel sprouts? Aren't they just about everyone's nemesis? Oh and it will set you back like $70 The bill....when I got it, it had someone else's name on it, but my room number, I'm like umm, you didn't check me in as the right person, and so the guy at the desk fixed it, or claimed to, and off I went. A few weeks later, I'm looking at my credit card statement and there are 2 charges, they charged me for my room plus the other persons room, whom I can only assume was the person I got mixed up with They fixed it, but why did this have to be so painful?
