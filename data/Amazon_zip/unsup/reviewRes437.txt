Alinea When the beauty of rustling leaves becomes culinary Sankai Juku, Godfrey Reggio, Haruki Murakami, Shakespeare, and Jasper Johns provide the context for my understanding of Alinea. My expectations were of food theater, and these were addressed, but with a hushed intensity revolving around more dimensions than it is possible or productive to relate in a review. Culinary performance endeavor may be a more apt description. The art and soul of the endeavor are things that grow organically from a myriad of explorations and reflections. I could carry on like this, but I'd just be saying that among other wonderful things, there is poetry here and I surely enjoyed it.
