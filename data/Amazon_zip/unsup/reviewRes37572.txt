Holy moley, this place was delish! Not only do they have Lindemans Framboise (yay!), but the food is amazing! Our recommendations: Stew: Duck Reuben on marble rye; Peking duck breast, slow-roasted, with cranberry cream cheese spread, house-made sauerkraut, emmenthaler, pommes frites. Laura: Organic Montreal-Style Brisket on rye; Montreal rub, slow roasted, briefly smoked; with house-made dill pickle (the pickle being the only disappointment) & frites. Dan: Toasted Nueske Ham on pumpernickel; gruyere cheese & apple-tarragon coleslaw; pommes frites The frites came with a garlic aioli that was so good, you'd almost slap your momma. Almost.
