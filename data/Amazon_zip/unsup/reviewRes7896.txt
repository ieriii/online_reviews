My husband and I went here because of a recommendation. We didn't have any apps - thought we'd save the extra room for dessert because I'd heard great things. My husband had the Salsiccia and we both thought it was great. I had some serious food envy since the Bianco Nero I ordered wasn't very good at all. It was too much oil, very greasy tasting. I was hoping for just the right amount of truffle, but it was really a bit overboard. We still went for the dessert, we ordered the pistachio gelato and the tartufo. Both were absolutely AMAZING. My husband and I were fighting over them - I won the who gets more battle since I didn't really have any pizza. It's a really loud atmosphere, average pizza and amazing desserts. We probably won't go back, we've had lots better food elsewhere.
