I went to Sunda for dinner on a Friday night with a group of 4, and we had a great night. Our reservation (which we made online through OpenTable) was for 10:30pm... it was all that was available and we thought it was going to be a bit late, but it proved to be the right call. The restaurant was very busy, but the service wasn't compromised. The food was delicious (Rock Shrimp was the highlight) and the vibe was great. All-in-all, a great start to the night and something I've already recommended to friends who are going to be visiting Chicago. You won't be disappointed.
