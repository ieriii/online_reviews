Cafe 28 is easy to love...and here's the reason why. The food, it's delicious! For starters, we had Maduros which are insanely good, sweet, smashed plantains. For my entree, I had THE most delicious dish. I'd highly recommend the Pistachio Crusted Chicken to anyone. It is sauted & baked pistachio crusted chicken breast, served over Jalapeno Mashed potatoes (ummm, heaven!!!) & sauted spinach, topped with a goat cheese porto wine sauce. OMG, it was amazing. My dining partner for the night had Ropa Vieja which is choice flank steak slowly simmered in a garlic tomato & bell pepper sauce until it falls apart (it's damn near shredded). Served with white rice, black beans & sweet plantains. Again, another great dish but I enjoyed mine better...so did he. Since I was talked into not eating healthy for the night, I went for some dessert and these guys know how to knock it out of the ball park with their Tres Leches cake. It was honestly probably the best I've ever had. The ambiance is fantastic. The service was great. There's tons and tons of street parking. I'm in love with Cafe 28! I'll be back soon.
