Once you get past the grumpiest bouncer in the city, you will find one of the most uniquely Chicago haunts in town. Great tunes, cool decor, eclectic clientel of all shapes colors and sizes, and some of the best bathroom graffiti in world. My buddies and I tend to go on late Fridays or Saturdays for the house bands (Sabertooth or Green Mill Quartet) and ultra cheap (or non-existent) post midnight cover. I will not die a happy man unless I get to see the supposed underground tunnels that were used to import Prohibition era booze. Fun fact: this is the only bar I can think of that takes cards, but ONLY Amex.
