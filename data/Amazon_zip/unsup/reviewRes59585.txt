Everyone needs to try Korean BBQ once in their life. Go with a large group this to this place and take part in the eating/bbq-ing experience. Everything comes with these little side dishes to share. Different vegetables, noodles, meat etc. The dumplings are very tasty as is the plum wine. I did get a headache from all of the smoke. Avoid wearing anything that needs to be dry cleaned because of the bbq smoke smell it will have. Also you have to take your shoes off, so consider that into your outfit decision as well. I was wearing boots and it was just akward.
