It almost pains me to give this four stars because my experience was less than a "yay"...but that was my fault for going on a freaking FRIDAY at freaking 7:45. Don't go on a weekend night. Just don't. Unless you like having no where to sit even to drink a beer or waiting 2 hours to eat. We were told 45-hour wait, and an hour and 45 minutes later we got seated. Another 20 mins for the apps, and another 20 mins for the sandwiches. After waiting for out apps for 15 mins our waitress came back and asked if my friend wanted another beer. Her answer "no, I would like the first beer I ordered." But the food was good. Split the mussels and duck rueben. I have never had the nerve to order mussels before, but they looked so good I had to. And they were great (although at that point my cat might taste good to me). The duck reuben. Well. I get why people love it, but it wasn't harmonious for me. I love duck, I love reubens...but not together. I still ate it though! The fries are amazing. Mostly because of the garlic aioli. Ambiance is oh so cool, and you can't beat the bear list. But. DON'T. try. FRIDAY. or. SATURDAY.
