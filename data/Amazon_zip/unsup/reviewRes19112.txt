OMG! The flavors are so... OMG! You have to try the Ahogado (but then again, that's the only torta I tried so far-I'll be back)... The carnitas are to die for. The Aztec Chocolate is rich and almost coffee strong. Warning! Those expecting Swiss Miss will be overwhelmed... This isn't sweet, smooth hot chocolate. This is house made with ground cocoa nibs (there is some grittiness). But YUM! Get a churro or 3 to dip in the chocolate (and get it for dessert vs. with the food). The caldos (soups) are my next conquest when I return. They're plentiful and yummy. It can be a bit pricey and MORE than a bit crowded. You'll probably be seated at a communal table with others if you don't have a big group. Please go enjoy this restaurant. It's a gem! If you're bad with crowds (I am) try it on an early weekday around 11 AM or so. We went on a Tuesday for lunch and the crowd wasn't so oppressive.
