This is the first place I dined at when I arrived in Chicago. XOCO has been on my bookmark list for a long time so I was so excited to finally try it. When I arrived, the wait was 45 minutes and I was the only person in my party. So I waited and waited and waited and waited. Finally the moment came to order. I ordered the Chicken Tinga and a choro.  The Chicken Tinga was great. All the ingredients tasted so fresh, especially the chicken and the avocado. The flavors of all the ingredients combined made for great eating. The choro was also really good--perfectly fried with a good amount of sugar and cinnamon on top. Service was very good too. After sitting down, I didn't have to wait long to get my food.
