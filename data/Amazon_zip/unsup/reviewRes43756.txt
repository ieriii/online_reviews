I sometimes hike down to Milk & Honey on my lunch break and usually regret it just a little cause it's a block or two too far to get my order in, eat, and get back in enough time to not feel uncomfortably bloated and still be a good punctual employee. With that said, I have had some great sandwiches and salads here. I enjoy specials and they're usually running three interesting concoctions. It's quite busting around lunch hour but they seem to work through the line of people pretty well. They've got ourdoor seating as well as in door and have an efficient little system of getting you sat, fed, and out of there in a timely fashion. They cater nicely to the "to go" crowd and, despite running around like 3 yr olds due to the general busy-ness of the place, the staff is nice if they have a second to chat.
