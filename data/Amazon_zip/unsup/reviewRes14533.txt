Excellent fish varieties abound at this quaint BYOB diner in the heart of ravenswood. Great for breakfast, lunch or dinner. A wide array of choices for brunch. For dinner try the mussels as an appetizer. The potato pancake encrusted white fish is a delicious choice. The arctic char with diablo sauce makes an excellent spicy option. If you are looking for an additional side to share try the smoked mac and cheese.
