I love going to eat here, however I would avoid it during weekend holidays, as it always gets super filled, and the wait to enter is nearly an hour or longer. The food is delicious however. I absolutely love the house special, as well as the fillet mignon, but the one that is not wrapped in bacon. If you haven't been here, you definitely try it, as it is delicious, and for the price, you can eat all the meat you want, and the quality is stupendous.
