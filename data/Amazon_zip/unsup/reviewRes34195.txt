Headed over to Yolk last weekend around noon and the place was packed. The hostess told us that there was a 25-30 minute wait so we took a seat at the bar and ate there. I ordered the Eggs Benedict which are supposedly the best in the city. I can vouch that they were great. Others with me had some of the omelettes and said they were great. The food was reasonably priced too. I definitely recommend checking it out.
