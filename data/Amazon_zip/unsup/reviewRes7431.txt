Started out great with potato chips & bread & butter pickles, and it only got better. We tried the hushpuppies, onion rings, BBQ shrimp with polenta & smoked chicken wings for appetizers. They were all very good, but the wings were a knock-out. The onion rings were crispy, even when they were no longer hot. Good dipping sauces on the shrimp, onion rings & hushpuppies. We ordered a half slab of St Louis style ribs & the pulled pork shoulder. Both rocked! The pulled pork is some of the sweetest, juiciest meat I've ever tasted. They were served with slaw & cornbread and 3 different bbq sauces. Liked all the sauces. Didn't eat the sides because I was actually full after the appetizers, but I kept working on my food... For dessert, we tried both the carrot cake (the best we've ever tasted!) and the Derby pie which was also excellent. Both desserts and most of my pulled pork made it into the doggy bag & were really good the next day, too. The service was pleasant & very attentive. Beer & cocktails were tasty, and well-matched to the food. Definitely going back to Chicago q!
