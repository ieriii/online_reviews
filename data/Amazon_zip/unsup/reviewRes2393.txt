After waiting in line for an hour plus, it's a pleasant surprise to be greeted by a friendly bespectacled man who doesn't seem to mind a bit of chit chat, despite the constant stream of people pouring through the doors. This bespectacled man is the genius behind Hot Doug's, and by gosh, he is a master of creating delicious encased meats. I've yet to try a sausage I didn't like, and it only makes it better that you could get a Green River or 50/50 to wash it down!
