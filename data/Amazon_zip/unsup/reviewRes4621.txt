Well, well, well. The Purple Pig. Erybody wants some Purple Pig. So after waiting a quick 30 minutes at 2 PM or so on a weekday, we got a table outside. We felt lucky. We heard horror stories of 2 hour waits. Can you imagine? 2 hours to eat? I wouldn't be hungry or I'd have starved to death in two hours... So it was just the two of us, we had been eating like gluttons the last few days so we figure sharing a few plates...to...share and an entree would be just fine. Not so, not so. Whatever Purple Pig makes up in creativity, it lacks in quantity. And I don't eat very much. We got eggplant parm balls. They were awesome but they disappeared way too fast. We got a few other small plates-- I can't remember them, perhaps they aren't memorable. Then we got the fried chicken skewers. That sounds like it'll be pretty hearty, right? Nah, maybe 6 small pieces of chicken thigh on a stick, fried, great sauce. No joke, the food here is awesome. But the price, the wait, and the quantity (and remember, I really never complain about quantity) leaves a lot to be desired. Signed, Fat person from Houston who eats plates and plates of food
