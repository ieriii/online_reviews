omg so delicious! churros! tortas! almond horchata! this was the best meal i had in chicago. it was completely worth the 45 minute wait and the torture of smelling the food during that wait. by far my favorite was the churros and almond horchata. if i lived closer, i would stop in for this snack all the time.
