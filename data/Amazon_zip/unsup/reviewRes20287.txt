Great atmosphere for a BYOB-- love the people watching. I must admit I end up here about twice a month because it's an easy byob in the 'hood. The food itself is just OK. What really gets me down here though is the service. No one here has ever been even an OK server. They all need huge attitude adjustments. Also, they charge you corkage and don't open the bottles for you. On that note, they charge you $2 per roll to cut them small... $2 for one knife stroke???!!!! I just don't get it.
