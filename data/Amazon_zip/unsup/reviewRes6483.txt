Okay - so you know what I do before I go to Wildfire? Like for DAYS before I go to Wildfire? I walk around saying "mashed potatoes" and telling my friends "you know what's good at wildfire?" pause, beat, beat "the mashed potatoes" . . . and my friends are SO cool - 'cuz they put up with that. Of course now they don't mention that we're going there 'til an hour before we're going - so mmm . . . there may be something to that . . . but other than the potatoes and the chopped salad (hold the blue cheese, dressing on the side) - it's pretty much an average steakhouse. Not too bad, not to good. And I'm from Chicago which means that you have to be better than average to make it here. So the potatoes (did I mention I'm in love with their mashed potatoes? Wow I'm annoying - and just think, you can click off of this review) and the salad get a five, but everything else - ahh . . . averages to about a 3 . . . A C . . . A C plus, but a C nonetheless .
