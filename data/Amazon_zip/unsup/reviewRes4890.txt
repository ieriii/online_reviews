My first time to try the place, it was rainy and crowded so an hour wait for a meal was not suitable for my friend and I. We wound up in Heaven On Seven which is owned by the father of one of the partners in The Purple Pig. The concept itself seems fine wine, swine and cheese.  So we finally tried the place on Memorial day when the weather was warm and the place not crowded (although it got windy). The patio was open and the seating was fine. Looking through the menu, my friend looked over what to drink and we decided to get a bottle of red wine suggested by the waitress (btwn the 2 reds, she mentioned one was like Welch's grape juice (which my friend who is English by way of Canada didn't know what she meant). The wine was fine so now it was to the choice of foods. My poor friend was not necessarily a big fan of tapas style food. The order, he chose the arugula/asparagus salad which was good to him but really tasteless to me and the braised pork shoulder. I ordered several items, marinated olives, chevre noir, prosciutto balls, and jamon serrano with oyster mushrooms and fried duck egg. The menu is a mixed bag but mostly I love pork pork pork. Of the food we ordered here are the raves, faves and so so. salad was ok braised pork shoulder with mash was good! marinated olives yum chevre noir great but not enough toast pts to spread on. prosciutto balls not enuf prosciutto to taste jamon serrano with the fried duck egg was a good way to end we had the lemon penna cotta delish and festa di santa lucia crema ok. Overall the Purple Pig was a delight and a disappointment sort of like the name. How does the Pig turn Purple....it drank the grape wine! Since there were good selections on the menu, I would recommend it anyway. Go for what you like. cheese, small appetizers and easy to eat plates. Definitely try the olives, meaty and tasty.
