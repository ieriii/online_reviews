After our most recent visit I have just decided that this place sucks... royally. They really need to get their shit together... and I don't care if you're busier because you were featured on some stupid cable show, hire more staff. Again, after having been seated, we waited forever to be acknowledged. In fact, we actually watched our server go to three other tables before us... and they were all sat after us WTF?! We had the diner fare, and we've seriously had better at other, cheaper, diners. Who the hell likes a spinach salad with NO warm bacon dressing either - even though the warm bacon dressing is touted as "OH MY GOD." Service (once you get it) is decent, but I do have to mention their liquor law nazi again. F*ck you for scolding us about having a beer back with our $9 bloody mary's. So many other restaurants in Chicago actually OFFER a beer back, but Glenn's liquor law Nazi would rather threaten to withhold your drink because "you can't stack." This place is a joke... seriously. The fish meals that we've had have been mediocre at best. They're not mind blowingly awesome. If you want decent fish in the neighborhood, then stop by. I always wanted to try their Red Hot pancakes, but for the longest time, they've been out. The place just needs some serious work on several levels. I'm disappointed because this place has potential - they just fail to show it when we've been there... and we've been there SEVERAL times. I doubt we'll be going back, maybe for crab leg night, but that's about it.
