I have wanted to try this place out for a long time. Every time I pass by it, there are people waiting outside which peaked my interest even more.  I finally went there and found out what all the fuss was about. To eat, we had potato skins, steak fried chicken with potatoes and for dessert a strawberry shake. All tne food was delicious and it was hard to believe that it was meatless and that the shake was dairy free!  I want to come back here for breakfast and see what other yumminess I can try!
