Had the most amazing deep dish pizza there. Went there a week or so ago when I was friend in town visiting from out of town. We went there like mid-afternoon and by the time we left around 3ish, the place was packed on a Saturday. Maybe everyone eating there was hungover from the night before and was eating a late lunch? Not sure. Anyway....my friend lived here for 5 yrs before moving out west. When I asked her what she wanted to do when she was here, she had go to Pequod's pizza on her to do list. Seriously. it was one of the 2 serious things she had planned. I had only been to this place maybe like 4-5 years ago on a date. The pizza was good, but the date was bad. And I only had the thin crust. This time 3 of us ordered a medium I think,. which was six pieces in total. We got sausage and green pepper. It was AMAZINGLY good. We all ate a piece there and then took a piece home with us to eat for lunch the next day. Would totally recommend it to anyone who wants real Chicago pizza.
