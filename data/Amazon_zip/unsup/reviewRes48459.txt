Came here over MLK weekend with a bunch of friends and The Publican gave a whole new meaning to pork rinds for us! It was so good, we had the waiter "to-go" some for us!  The decor here is very simple yet works very well for them and also the menu. The pictures of the hogs and pigs are great! Some of the dishes we had: 1 of each oysters- east bay won by unanimous votes. bouchot mussels- was to DIE for!!! We soaked up the last bit of the juice with bread after devouring the mussels. The king crab- we could have lived without. Aged ham- very good! MUST try! And last but not the least.... Sweetbread!!!!!! I wasn't a fan but The Publican made me a fan and we had to order another plate!!! So good! Publican, thank you for the awesome experience!!! I left a happy happy girl! =)
