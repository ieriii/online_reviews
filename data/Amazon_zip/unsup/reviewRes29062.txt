DELISH! This place was so delicious!! The price was not bad and the menu was like 5 pages!! I ordered some curry that the waiter recommended and it was wonderful! I got the mild and there was some serious heat to it but I ate the whole thing anyway. A little annoying you have to pay for a side of rice with curry, but whatever. So good went with a group and it is great that its BYOB too! Will definitely return!
