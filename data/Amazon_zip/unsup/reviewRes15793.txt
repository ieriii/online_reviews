Word up Izzy on the WTF!! No standing room? Have to reserve a stool? No Macallan? No Johnny Walker? No Grey Goose? Can't be TOO loud? Preservation of a quiet atmosphere? Really? Just a LITTLE forced pretense (referencing David F's review)? If you're looking to go out, have some drinks and dance/lounge to good music... this is not the place for you. On the other-hand, if you're looking to wait endlessly for a bar stool in a dark underground speakeasy, have some quiet converation, and try some alcohol you've never heard of, then hallelujah ~ this is the promised land. As for me, I'm into ordering drinks that I like to drink... listening to music I've heard of... and being able to talk, joke, laugh, sit, stand and move around as I please.
