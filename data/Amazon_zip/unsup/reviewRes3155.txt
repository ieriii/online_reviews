Crisp is not just your ordinary chicken. We have eaten there twice now and have tried Crisp BBQ, Seoul Sassy and Plain Jane. My favorite is the Crisp BBQ. It is so delicious and it is spicy. Seoul Sassy is great too. The taste is so unique and a must try! Plain Jane was just what it says - plain. I wasn't a fan especially after trying the BBQ and Seoul Sassy. I will definitely go back to Crisp. They have a check in deal right now which is pretty good - $19.99 for a whole chicken, 2 sides and 2 sodas. Awesome!
