We received a gift card for any of the Francesca's restaurants and I'm so glad we picked Mia Francesca to go to. We've been to Francesca's on Taylor which was also fantastic but were surprised to show up to Mia Francesca and find a boisterous environment since Francesca's on Taylor is a lot more quiet and subdued.  The service was great, we didn't feel rushed at all. It is slightly cramped but I believe that's part of the charm of the open kitchen restaurant. I had the Mahi Mahi which was sauted and garnished perfectly. The husband had the Tilapia which, as I heard, was also delicious. For dessert we had their Vanilla Bean Crme Brulee... oh so good. It is loud, it's a good date place if you know the person you're with and enjoy to laugh a lot but don't expect an intimate conversation.
