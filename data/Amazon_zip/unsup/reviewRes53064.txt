It's been about a year since my last review and you guys have taken the Armitage location up a notch! When I went last week for the first time in a long time - I noticed major improvement from the service to the ambiance - the food was tasty as ever. I step in the back patio and feel like I'm on vacation - I love your taste and what you've done to spiff it up! Now if only I could get a reservation for Sat 7/31 for 16 people, these people being my family =)
