great fun! this is not your chichis or Americanized Mex - subtle flavors, not vinegar fueled hot sauce (and don't expect spicy - not at all. expect subtle! Rick himself explained the lack of spicy to me first time I was there and in the mood for spicy. He's terrific!) good choices regardless of time of year. Rick is sometimes there, as friendly as can be. People working behind the counter are wonderfully professional and friendly. Just a nice vibe.  Go with the gang from work on a Monday to start the week on a high note. Go Wednesdays to break up the weak. Go on Friday to start the weekend off early. You'll have a good experience at all times. downside: long lines. But the professionalism, the energy, and the vibe make it well worth the wait
