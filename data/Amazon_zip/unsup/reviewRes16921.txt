First of all, how can you not love all the color everywhere and the wall of wine that lights up various colors! The interior decor definitely did not let me down after seeing the vibrant name on the side of the building that I'd driven by so many times on the highway that made me want to try it out!  Our party of two was there on a Sunday evening, so I can't speak for the scene on a weekend night (although I hope to try that out sometime), but we had great service, good sangria, and delicious, impressive food. We tried the tuna ceviche, which was a good starter, but the real winners in my book were our entrees. My boyfriend had that Mama Mendez' Arroz Con Mariscos which is a generous helping of a blend of seafood, chicken and chorizo in very flavorful rice. I had the Churrasco (sliced beef tenderloin with arugula chimichurri) which was extremely tender and came with malanga goat cheese puree -- which were basically like super, super creamy goat cheese mashed potatoes ... I'd give my right arm for the recipe for these! Well, maybe not quite that far, but seriously, SO good.  Based on some of the other reivews, it sounds like we lucked out on our service, but I had a great experience here. Definitely hope to be back, possibly on a busier night, to see that atmosphere and try more delicious food!
