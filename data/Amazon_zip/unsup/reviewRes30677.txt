Well played Mastro's, well played. It's been a long time since I ate myself in a food coma. This place put me in one. My bone in rib eye was cooked perfectly. I like my steaks bloody and they obliged. The shrimp mashed potatoes were insanely good as a side dish. Also, the drinks were stiff. After dinner I had to go immediately home, put my feet up, and spend the next 24 hours complaining I was too full. The only qualm I had about this place is how dark they keep it. This would probably be Batman's place to eat. Mastro's has jumped over Capital Grille, Smith and W, Kinsey's, and Gibsons in my book. I will be coming back once I recover.
