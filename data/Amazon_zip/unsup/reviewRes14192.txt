Have been here once. LOVE LOVE LOVE IT. It's right off the brownline at Montrose. I went right after work on a Friday night with my sister and they said the wait was 30 minutes - so we took a seat at the bar and 5 minutes later, they had a table for us. I had the tilapia and my sister had the sword fish. If you like steak - get the sword fish, i tried hers and it was really good. My meal was also pretty amazing... I'm going back for breakfast... great place to take the kiddies too...
