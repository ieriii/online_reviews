The food is the standard BBQ pork and duck ... but since it came out that they have "Peking Duck" the non-Asian crowd has come in to see the next newly discovered "cheap eat". In summary, the food is OK, but inexpensive - on a side note ... they charge for rice after the first bowl ... so be careful if you want additional bowls! After moving to the new "modern" location the service has gone way down. It seems like they don't have enough service staff to handle the influx of people since articles came out on them in the local media. Just try to get your glass of water refilled. Although you see the owner grinning from ear to ear on all the dollars coming into the place. The managers/staff need to insitute a better way of handling the crowds or customers will get fed up and only order take out.
