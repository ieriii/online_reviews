Food was perhaps above-avg., but no longer such a great value. Prices apparently have gone up; wine especially. Worst part of experience, was the Mrs. Owner, who was rude to everyone. At least 6 time during our meal, she berated her new Host right next to our Table -- and, we thought he was nice and doing a good job. Better places to go for this type of food; and prefer BYOB.
