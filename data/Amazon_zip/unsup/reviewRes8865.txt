I have been searching for a good, Italian-style (sorry, I've never gotten used to the deep dish thing) pizza topped with spinach and ricotta after a semester abroad years ago. While this is not a regular menu item at Spacca Napoli, it was a special one day last winter, and it was fantastic! I know not everyone shares my appreciation for spinach and ricotta, but even a simple pizza here with sauce and mozzarella just melts in your mouth. Also, the owner is a really friendly guy.
