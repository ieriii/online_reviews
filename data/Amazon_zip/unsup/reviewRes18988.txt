1st visit: drinks at the bar with girlfriend. Bartender was funky, thought she seemed cool, so I asked for a beer recommendation--something light and not bitter. (no lies here, I know nothing about beer, but I don't like it bitter at all) She picks out something and it's okay. Still too bitter for me to finish. She asks how I like it and I tell her it's okay, but I don't think I can finish it. She offers to put a splash of some berry ale. Literally a splash. Well yes, it made my beer way better, and I was happy about that. But she charged me a buck for the splash. ?? weird. 2nd visit: probably worst hangover ever. The staff knew it, too, but they were super nice. We order burgers. I was oh so unimpressed. We ordered it medium. This was very heavily on the rare side, I'd say. Super boring burger. And when I have a hangover, any burger will normally taste fantastic. Yuck. I saved it for leftovers, and disliked it later, too. Sad, because it's so close to home and it's so pretty inside. I don't know if I'll be returning. I've had a million better burgers elsewhere.
