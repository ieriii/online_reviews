Sapori Tratorria is an Italian restaurant, on the smaller side, not too crowded of busy, a cute ambiance with little white lights and super friendly service. It has lots of weekly deals (like Family Style Mondays and Wine Tasting Wednesdays) We didn't take them up on any of their specials... But we went in a group of 8 and had a great time!! The first thing I loved about Sapori was when I called to make the reservation. Ricardo was so nice and cute saying, "of course we'll take care of you!" and "ciao, ciao!" He kept asking if it was for an occasion, I heard that if it is they will make special menus for your party... which is a nice touch... of course I didn't take them up on that either. The food was very good, everyone seemed pleases. Our waiter remembered our orders without writing it down (and a table of 8 I mean, thats pretty impressive). The sign is difficult to see from the outside, but we found it, and had a great time!! what we learned: the pasta and risotto dishes are HUGE and SHOULD be shared. what we loved: the BREAD! Homemade, served warm and fresh the service: Friendly and helpful... i heart ricardo! the price: Our total bill was $210 which made it about $26/person... none of us had drinks BONUS: they gave us free dessert... and it was delicious! tiramisu, flan, and bread pudding... yummo! oh and at the time it had a coupon on http://restraunt.com so, check that out!
