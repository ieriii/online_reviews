I'm visiting Chicago and my friend took me here because I'm vegetarian. Wow! What a delight to sit down in a diner and have a whole menu of appetizing vegetarian dishes. The waitstaff was friendly and helpful and they had a nice selection of beers. My "cheeseburger" was great and my nonvegetarian dish enjoyed her meal as well. When I am back in Chicago I'll make a point of coming here.
