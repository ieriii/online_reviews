Loved this place!! It was my first weekend night since moving to Chicago, and my friend suggested we check this place out. We didn't get there until after 10, but it was packed with what seemed to be a really cool crowd... just super chill. The pizza was fantastic... decently thin, so not crazy filling which was perfect when having beers... don't want to fill up on thick ass pizza when they have so many great brews to offer! While using the bathroom I read that they have live band karaoke... def going to hit that up at some point. My common complaint with Chicago restaurants is that I was sitting REALLY close to the table to my right and left... tough to have a candid conversation. That's a very small complaint thought for a place that was overall just awesome.
