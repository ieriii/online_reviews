Who the heck wants to fill up on Deep Dish w/ so many incredible craft beers available with top notch New Haven (CT) style pizza? Not this guy. Some of the freshest drafts can be found here w/ so many different styles to choose from is just one more reason to visit Piece. Great names to their beers (Cameltoe...seriously) and have a number of HDTV's for local sports.  Their oblong pizzas with incredible options for toppings are to die for. Have to opt for the mashed potato and bacon if you want something different.  The wait can get crazy on most nights, especially the weekend, but somehow those girls know just how to find me when it is our turn to be seated. I must be special. Seriously, if I travel to Chicago and do not hit up Piece, I feel like the trip was wasted....it is that good.
