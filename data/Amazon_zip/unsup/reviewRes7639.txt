I've dined at the Kansas City Fogo de Chao but lost the battle with my girlfriend to dine here. (There are only hundreds of other Chicago restaurants we've never been to - but when a girl wants meat...) The salad bar is amazing. This Fogo serves Spanish Manchego in addition to DOC Parmigiano-Reggiano which is really cool. The meat orgy tha follows is pretty standard for Fogo - men with sharp knives cutting you pieces of beef, chicken and lamb in accordance to your desires. They really try to upsell you on purchasing wine but I recommend water with the huge amount of salt that comes with eating that much meat. Overall a good, predictable dining experience.
