The fact that Publican failed to land a Michelin star leaves me questioning the critics more than the restaurant. The food here is rustic and simple fare at its best. It's rare to find a venue where the dishes get better with each visit.  I've found that the simpler the item reads on the menu, somehow the more amazingly good it is. We ordered the grilled pork ribeye as a "filler" towards the end of our meal and ended up fighting over who would be the lucky stiff to savor the last bite. This is also the best place in town to slurp down freshly shucked oysters. I have experienced some misses. Sweetbreads were spongy and far from the best I've had. No one in our party of 4 was eager to finish the Hamachi Crudo. Despite the countless number of beers offered, somehow I always expect a little bit more out of the swill. Guess I'm not a fan of trappist style beer, but then I always enjoy the selection at Hopleaf. Love what I'd describe as a new American tapas style format to this place. Family style small plates so that sampling and sharing is implicit. Some might consider the atmosphere and decor here to be drab, but I for one find the butcher hall communal seating and washroom format to be whimsical, festive, and fitting.
