Great service, welcoming attitude, fresh made thin crust pizzas are displayed behind glass and at times you can see a flock of char chickens resting on the grill. Since all their food is displayed and ready to be grabbed, everything looks appealing and you feel prompted to try. (Especially if you've read reviews, about which are best) All toppings are fresh and the vegetables are flavorful. Their meat toppings come in spicy and mild which is interesting, since many other pizza joints won't offer this option. Inside its warm you can see cooks preparing food, making pies and during this they are inquiring to your day, what brought you in and how your meal is. There is enough seating for less than fifteen maybe and when the tables are full you may not want to walk in with a group. Combo meals are available on chicken and pizza and if you are solo this works best. If with some friends you may like to order a whole pie (cost effective) and do so on Tuesdays since FoGo would donate a full pie for each sold, to feed the homeless. Cons: Veggie pizza slices are tasty but the slice dripped water when folded, probably from the veggies. Spicy Italian sausage pizza lacked sauce, felt oily, first bites were good but ending was just okay, the taste of the sausage saves the slice from lacking. Thin crust but not crispy, more of a chewy soft texture. Considering what's available in the area its pretty good and different, so when you're nearby its an option, but not something I'd go out of my way for.
