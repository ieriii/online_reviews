I had the pleasure of spending one of the last truly amazing summer nights dinning al fresco at the Isle. I'm a big fan of Greek food in general, and have tried a lot of the places in Greektown. But this is by far my favorite. The food is delicious and so affordable. The specials are are usually so tempting they make me stray from my classic menu choices.  When I go with a group of friends I like to do the cold sampler plate with warm pita's. And I always get the Tzatziki too. I tend to think the saginaki is a waste. It's more for show than taste (IMHO). But on the last night of summer we started with the fried calamari. Lightly breaded and generous in portion. With a little squeeze of lemon it was perfect. We also had the pita's and Tzatzki. The only thin I wish they did differently is forgo the basket of bread on the table and replace it with warm pita's. Most people order them anyhow and it just seems a waste of bread to put it out. Anyhow, I had the lamb stewed with peppers and potatoes. The sauce was delicious. The portion was huge and I enjoyed sharing it with my BF. He had the stuffed peppers. Although he said they were only ok, I think he was just trying to boost my stew, LOL The outdoor seating was really nice and despite how busy it was, the service was very attentive. Something I've always found at this location. Among other dish's I've adored: the Spanakotiropita- always bursting with feta and spinach, the Dolmades - so cool and refreshing, the Mousaka - both the meat and vegan is fantastic.  But an all time fav has to be the Garides. It's like a casserole of baked shrimp, feta and tomato sauce. The feta gets sort of melty but still keeps some of its density. The shrimp are a nice size (not whimpy).  In fact, all this talk is making me so hungry for Greek food I might have to get my ass off the lazy boy and head out to Halstead.
