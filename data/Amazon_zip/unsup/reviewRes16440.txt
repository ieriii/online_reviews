Wife really wanted to check out this spot so I reluctantly agreed for or anniversary. We decided to go for some pre-dinner cocktails so strolled on at 7:15 on a Wed and were seated immediately. The whole layout with the tall chairs was really cool. I loved my Deerhunter and Pimms Cup. The wife had the Full Stop which was good and some other seasonal vodka drink which tasted like a $12 vodka/OJ. All-in-all, not a place I can afford to go to on a regular basis but very swanky. Plus the Whistler is more of my scene. And the server was super helpful helping us thru the vast cocktail menu.
