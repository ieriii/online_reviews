I lived in Costa Rica for three months, and this is not at all what I was expecting. I did not find the food to be authentic in any way, besides the bottled Lizano salsa. I had a chicken casado - not like any casado that I've ever had before - and not in a good way. I really don't understand all the 4 and 5 star reviews for this place, everything I tried was extremely bland. Maybe I was just there on an off night???
