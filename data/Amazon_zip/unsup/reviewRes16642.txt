Violet Hour is where you go when you want the hours to disappear on a night out. Something about the plethora of heavy fabric curtains, dim lighting, soft music, and [really] high-backed chairs makes the entire place seem ethereal. I have never had an issue with waiting more than 10-15 minutes in line - Friday late-night with 4 guys and 1 girl: waited 15 minutes - Saturday late-night with me as the fifth wheel: waited 10 minutes. There are two factors that seem to help in moving up the line -- well-dressed groups, and also just the availability of seating arrangements for your particular party size. I wouldn't really recommend this place if you're going to be a third or fifth-wheel, or if you're coming to meet new people. I would however recommend making Violet Hour a stop for a drink earlier on in your night before you go out and rage on a club dance floor. The staff are all friendly, including the doorman. Small eats here are excellent along with their well-crafted libations. Do take your girl here to have an actual conversation before you lose track of the entire night in another part of town.
