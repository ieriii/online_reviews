Located on Michigan Avenue across from Millennium Park and down steps from the Art Institute, this place has a fantastic location for tourists...which might have deterred me, being from the area...but upon dining here, the place didn't seem to have a touristy feel to it.  By no means am I an expert of fine dining, but I'm also no stranger. This place was sweet, classy, and elegant in a casual yet upscale way. The staff knows their stuff, including the beer list, and the ambience was nice...on a hot summer day, we sat down in an intimate cozy booth, adorned with simple white candlelight, and clean line table settings. Our table of four ordered fish and chips, a pork medallion salad, and a turkey sandwich, along with appetizers, and dessert. Everything was lovely. and the Food tasted really really good.  A little pricy, but what is to be expected for this type of dining, in this location. I'll go back next time I'm down there.
