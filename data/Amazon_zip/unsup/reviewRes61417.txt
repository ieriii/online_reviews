This is by far the best vegan restaurant in Chicago, for me! I have an asian taste and love Thai food. Their style of food is just that! I've been to both the Fullerton and Montrose ones and their food quality is consistent! Among all the dishes I liked, I think the green curry is my personal favorite. But trust me, you wont be disappointed with any dish you order.
