I have had a few conferences and events here now, and I'm always impressed by the interior and meeting spaces.  Never did stay here, but a great place to enjoy boring power point slides.  Only downside was a dank must basement exhibition space. The tower suite is amazing, overlooking the lake and Grant park. Also, save yourself the 300% markup and don't buy any food here, just walk down the street to the other chains surrounding.
