If you like cozy Irish pubs (and I do!) this is the place for you 1) Awesome location 2) Great beer selection 3) Great comfort food My experience here was a little strange but they remedied it quickly so I'm giving this the 4-star! Came here on a busy Saturday night in July and grabbed a table by the front (feeling of being outdoors without actually being outdoors). We got the Whiskey Grilled wings as a starter. Very yummy - great flavor and dipping sauce. Then, we proceeded to wait almost 45 minutes for our entrees. It was busy though and we had beers so we didn't mind the wait. Then, when our food game, it was nearly room temperature. I ordered the chicken curry and my husband had the Wilde burger with fries. We debated for a long time whether or not it was worth sending back on a busy Saturday, but our waiter came up pretty quickly so we mentioned it to him and he insisted on having our orders redone. (I'm sure he was pissed that some food runners left the food sitting out) I swear in less than 10 minutes our food was out piping hot! They apologized profusely and the food was tasty Burger - yummy cheese, onions, the whole thing Curry - One of my best Irish curries yet. Love the wild rice and squash. At the end of the night, the manager even took 10% off of our bill - so nice! Good food + environment + they were quick remedy a potential bad situation. I will definitely be back (I wanna try that mac and cheese!)
