I ate here last summer and had been looking forward to it for weeks...maybe even months. I knew I was going to order the fake reuben. (Thats what I get to tell if its a good diner) So I get there...and? eh... it was pretty blandish and not the familiar greaseball of a sandwich. I will try the place again, but man, it wasn't that great of a reuben. Also, I don't usually judge a place on service, but it wasn't all too great either.
