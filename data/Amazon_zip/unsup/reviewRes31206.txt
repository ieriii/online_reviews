Nana's is just what Bridgeport needed!!!!  I've been living in Bridgeport for 6 years now and was sick of driving north, to crowded Greektown or downtown every time I craved fabulous breakfast food.  Now my problem is solved and it's mostly organic/local Hallelujah!! Besides organic, flavorful delicious food~~ Place is beautiful Clean Service is great Friendly staff Not crowded even on the weekend And if I decide I want take out instead its ready in 15-20 minutes.... How much better can you get?? Oh and their lunch and dinner is splendid also!
