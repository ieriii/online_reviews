After reading reviews of how expensive Art of Pizza was, I was surprised to get a slice for $2.75 and a pop for a buck more. A lunch for two people, each with a soda and a slice, was $8.50. And the pizza was magnificent. I can only imagine what it's like when you get a fresh pie. Listen, I'm a New Yorker, and I'm admitting loving a Chicago deep dish pizza. That alone should convince you to go. Also, they show "Maury" on their flatscreen TVs. Pizza + paternity tests = lunchtime bliss. I do love deep dish, and Art of Pizza makes my favorite.
