Mmmmeat... Love it. So why not hit up one of these Brazilian Steak houses. Salad Bar - Solid enough. Good selection, but not overwhelming you as you are here for meat. Service - On top of their game, as soon as you flip to green they are right there. Server was attentive yet not annoying. Wine Acrobat was so interesting we even considered ordering a bottle just to make her fly. Meat - All the cuts of Beef were delicious and seasoned just right, Pork... Eh little dry, Lamb - Juicy and Tasty. Ambiance - Overall great. Dark and Woody but open and inviting. For the odd night out when you want to ensure you are boosting your Iron supply, do it up. Can't think that this can make the regular rotation, just way to much opportunity to hurt yourself. But it is so good...
