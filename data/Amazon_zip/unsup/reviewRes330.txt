Aside from my old and dear friend's wedding, Alinea was the main purpose we recently traveled to Chicago. (Well, that and Hot Doug's.) I suppose that was the problem: with that kind of expectation, I'm not sure any restaurant could lived up. I should have known better. I should not have expected the culinary equivalent of David Blaine, to be wowed to the point of incredulity. How did they DO that? Instead, what we had was a well executed, if slightly overfilling, 12-course meal of haute cuisine.  There certainly were soaring high points (the wagyu beef was not only a fantastic cut but also perfectly prepared; the reduction infused with thai flavors was almost Blaine-ish in its magic). There were lows (the crack pipe-like glass cylinder filled with desserts just didn't do it, nor did the gooey cube of potato). The staff were expert, if not slightly odd at times, and the atmosphere was excellent. I do feel the wine pairings were not worth the expense, I should have trusted myself to go off the list instead. All in all, I think Alinea was worth the experience, but I don't think the experience transcended the sum of its parts. I wish I could have had larger portions of a few of the dishes, rather than the smaller portions of many dishes, but that is the risk of the tasting menu. That said, nothing anyone could have said on Yelp would have stopped me from going, that's how curious I was, so if you are like me, you'll go, just temper your expectations!
