I used to live in Chicago a couple of blocks from this hotel and every time I come back to visit I try to stay at Hotel 71. Their amazing views of the Chicago river and the city bring back so many memories. And I love that they don't have mini bars -- this helps prevent accidents when this sugar cravings creep up.
