Mexican street tacos in Chicago! Wow, this place is keepin it real. If you are there before and not after the bars you might even catch them peeling fresh garlic for their green sauce. Years ago I 'accidentally" left with a bottle of it, it was that good, I thought I brought it myself! This place is so yummy they have 3 locations on this SAME intersection. Weird, but true. Chile relleno and carne asada doused in green sauce, my fav. This is the place to go when you are really hungry and want food immediately. So basically, its best after the bars or a long flight or bike ride! True, its not "california".. these aren't mission style (as in, the churches? really? [double eww]), but if you know mexican food and want something legit.. not "burritos the size of your head" then check this place out for your taco fix. Minus a star for throwing chile rellenos in the microwave, not sure if they are still doing it or if there is another way.. I just have a weird thing about microwaves. I really don't think its detracting from taste.
