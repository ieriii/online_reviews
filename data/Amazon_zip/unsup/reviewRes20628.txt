I suggested this restaurant for myself and a few colleagues to dine at after a conference. I was right around St Patrick's day, so I was looking for a place that was authentic, but also classy....no drunk green beer wielding frat boys here! It was just what I was looking for. Interesting selection, nice staff, and a great atmosphere.
