After hearing the hype for months, I finally decided to see if the burgers at The Bad Apple were really so tasty. I had the Left Coast Reuben burger (burger, swiss cheese, special sauce, and coleslaw), and while it was, indeed, very tasty, I felt underwhelmed. The patty was too thick, and while I ordered medium, there was a slight dryness to it. I really did like the combination of the pretzel roll, swiss cheese, and special sauce, though. The fries were ok. I had them seasoned with chipotle seasoning, and that blended nicely with the sweet homemade ketchup. I prefer the homemade ketchup at Three Aces. We also tried the cheese curds, for which I also had high expectations based on other reviewers' ratings. They were ok, but nothing to write home about. In fact, they were kind of greasy. The homemade ranch dip was addictive, though.  I would DEFINITELY go back to the Bad Apple for the extensive beer menu, though. I tend to like fruitier beers and ciders, and I couldn't believe they had my favorite lambic, Framboise, on tap!
