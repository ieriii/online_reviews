Nothing compares to Alinea. Nothing. We've been twice, and both times were able to rate it five stars, despite the overly pretentious service and atmosphere. Honestly, it's just amazing food and a mind-blowing experience. Definitely worth flying to Chicago for. And always spring for the wine tasting-- it really increases the pleasure of the meal.
