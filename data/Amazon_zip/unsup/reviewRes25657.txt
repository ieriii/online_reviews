This place is my favorite. I've been here 3 or 4 times. Get the deep dish - the crust is super crispy and the upper layers are filled with cheesy gooey-ness. This time we went with a group of 7 on a Saturday night. We called earlier in the day around 3:30p for reservations because we expected the place to be packed. When we arrived at 7:00p the placed was crowded (as predicted) but we breezed by those who didn't have the foresight to make a reservation and were immediately seated on the second floor. We ordered two pizzas - a sausage, bell pepper, and mushroom, and a pepperoni, and bell pepper. The sausage and bell pepper was a hit, and the pepperoni was a distant second. The fried appetizer plate was decent, but not a must-have. Like always, we ordered pitchers of Half-Acre. Despite the massive number of customers on the second floor, our waitress was awesome and was always around to refill our pitchers or to meet other needs. Per usual - dining at Pequods was an excellent experience.
