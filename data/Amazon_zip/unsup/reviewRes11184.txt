This is one of my fave brunch spots ever. It's one of those places I recommend to out-of-towners (no deep-dish pizza recommendations from this one). Their menu is seasonal, which has its pros and cons, probably my only complaint is that when I find a dish I really love, the next time I go back it's been taken off. Yes, their waits on weekends are ridiculous, as expected. Most recently I went with a friend on a Tuesday afternoon around 1:30. No wait, of course. Off to a good start. We ordered the French Toast (it had berries, white chocolate, a brown sugar crust of sorts). When we got it, I'm pretty sure all the tables around us gasped at its beauty and size. I was afraid the white chocolate would make it overly sweet (sometimes their pancakes that are drenched in white chocolate are just a little too sweet for me), but the balance was perfect and I loved this dish. The brown sugar was also a nice touch. I may just have to go back and order it before they switch up the menu again. We also got the seasonal omelette (chicken, avocado, tomato, queso). A bit under-seasoned, but tasty nonetheless. And really, avocados just make everything better, don't they? Their portions are huge, so remember to share your dishes, and mix up the sweet and savory. When you take a look at those pancakes, you'll know why.
