Yay for date night! Finally got back to Coast after a few years and it was better than I remembered. Although, I did get take out last time... Strolled in on a busy Thursday night and were greeted with a 30 minute wait. Gave the hostess my cell and chilled out in the car with just enough time for each of us to finish a beer. BYOB six packs come in handy while waiting to be seated. We grabbed a (surprisingly comfy) seat at the sushi bar. It was pretty neat to watch the precision and artistry of the chefs. With our beers on ice, we were ready to start ordering ,what turned into, a gluttonous feast. Spicy miso soup and seaweed salad to start. Both totally hit the spot. The softshell crab appetizer was to die for for, as were the scallops. We ended up getting like 3 or 4 rolls, all equally delicious. But the crowning glory was the toro topped with a quail egg. Total mouthgasm! I'll go back just for that. We finished with a mix of the ice creams, my favorite was the ginger. Perfect way to end the meal. The atmosphere here is exactly what you'd expect for Bucktown. The service was stellar, amazing sushi and BYOB. How can you go wrong?
