We were in town for the NRA show last week and had one of the worse experiences I have encountered in a long time. We made a reservation 6 weeks prior to the show, knowing that restaurants would be booked for the weekend. Saturday afternoon, they called to confirm our reservation for 7:00. We replied we would be there early to enjoy apps and cocktails in the bar. We arrived at 6:15 and checked at the front desk. To our surprise, we were told that we didn't have a reservation?? We mentioned that they had called to confirm earlier. The gentleman at the hostess stand(40,bow tie) asked us what our name was and phone number. We gave him the information and he said they didn't have us in his system. Being in the industry for over 30 years, i understand people try to lie and take advantage of restaurants on busy weekends. After 2 or 3 minutes of discussion, I asked the gentlemen if he was calling me a liar? He told me that if I had a reservation they would have it in their system. I said again, are you calling me a liar, he replied that if we called it would be in their system! We left frustrated and hungry! We ended up at Morton's, who was more than happy to take our money and business. I have called and left 2 messages with their home office, with NO response. I guess when you're a big time restaurant with a big name behind you, customer relations is at the bottom of the list!!
