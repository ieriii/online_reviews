Great food, great atmosphere, with one caveat: extremely loud. Try to get seated towards the front. I get tired of the pork belly craze but I have to admit Gilt's is fabulous. Order the marrow just for the sight (it tastes great too but the dish is something to behold). Also, they paced the dishes as requested instead of serving anything at anytime, which is always a danger.
