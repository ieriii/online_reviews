Went there on Saturday with friends...I love caribean food and it was not disapointing....for starters we had the "mariquitas", "yuca" and chifles...everything delicious...I had the fish and eventhough it was scary it was really good ..the best thing was the rice...loved the rice! .we are going back for sure!!! good prices and service! We even danced with the waiter...;)
