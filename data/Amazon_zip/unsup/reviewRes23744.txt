This place is worth the wait. Where else would you want to be on a warm summer night than the patio of Irazu, sampling delicious Costa Rican food and drinking your BYOB wine!? We had 7 in our group, so the wait was just under an hour because the patio is so popular. But once we got seated, the service was excellent (Thank you, Chris!) and we never felt rushed. The entrees are generous, so our group shared several dishes. I'd recommend the steak Casada and the vegetarian burrito. The vegetables are grilled to perfection. And don't pass up the Costa Rican-style rice. It's to die for.... Irazu is a great environment for just about any occasion - catching up with friends, celebrating a birthday (we saw an adorable group of friends with birthday hats), or even a date. The prices are VERY reasonable...just don't forget your cash!
