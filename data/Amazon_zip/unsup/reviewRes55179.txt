This weekend was my first trip to Q. It will definitely not be my last, as I'm already planning on returning for my birthday next week.  I am a big fan of BBQ, and in my opinion, this place is one of the best, if not THE best places I've been for it (without doubt here in Chicago). The food is incredible. From the homemade chips, to the homemade bread/butter pickles (which I'm not a fan of from the jar), to the fantastic st. louis style ribs....place can't be beat. They must of spent a TON of money renovating the place to make it look like it does, which is like a nice southern home feel. I like the bar area they have out front where you can sit and have a whiskey and watch the game while waiting for your table. The service and staff were incredibly friendly and the prices were very reasonable considering the quality of the food and size of the portions. Can't say enough about this place---one of my new favs in the city for sure!
