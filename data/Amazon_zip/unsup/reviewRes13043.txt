I was just asked for some dining recommendations in Chicago and I put Cafe 28 on the list. I have been to Cafe 28 multiple multiple times and have always had consistently great food and great service. Ive mostly been for dinner. I vaguely recall going during brunch years ago, and not being impressed, but it was so long ago I cannot explain why. (It was an awkward family gathering, I think.) Other than that difficult-to-recall experience, I love their mojitos, I love their pistachio crusted chicken, the pork is fantabulous, the appetizers are all tasty, and the crazy honey-spicy-butter that comes with the bread is awesome. A few months ago, I recommended out-of-town coworkers head there for dinner, and they had an amazing time and loved the ropa vieja. All around this is a great choice for dinner, be it a romantic dinner, girls-night-out, or any occasion at all.
