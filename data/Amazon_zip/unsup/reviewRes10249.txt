My wife and I were on a tour of Chicago and we decided to take the train north to a brewpub. The area reminded me of Uptown in Minneapolis, a little hipster and cookin' We entered the busy establishment and sat down at one of the tables. It was kind of weird, because a few minutes later a family was sitting 3 feet away from us on the left and to the right, 2 guys sat down about 2 feet away. Everyone was cool, but they were way too close. I ordered one of their IPAs, it was nice and fruity and the second one I ordered with dinner was just as good. The pizza was solid with a nice crisp thin crust and my wife got the pizza with no cheese or oil and it came out perfectly. Our server was a cool dude that helped us whenever we needed it. Great Chicago Brewpub!
