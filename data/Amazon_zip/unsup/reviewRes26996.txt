I went here for brunch this past weekend. There was no wait to sit inside, but there was a small wait to sit at the outdoor patio. Our waiter was nice and helpful. We ordered the hot cakes indgenas, which were served with whipped goat cheese, agave syrup, red chile glazed bacon, and 2 sunny-side up eggs. Very good dish--I was a little surprised that the goat cheese was sweet. I expected and wish it was savory, but it was still delicious. All the flavors worked together, and it was best eaten combining all parts of the dish. The huevos estilo "el bajio" came with a creamy chili poblano sauce that was amazing! Can't wait to go back for dinner!!
