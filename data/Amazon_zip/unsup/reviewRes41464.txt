I don't eat beef, so I was pleased that I found a Chicago steak house that would be able to serve me food that I enjoy! Warning though, only come here if you are prepared to eat rich food. And by rich I mean, once you walk in to the restaurant, you can immediately smell the butter they use. For my entree, I ate the Steelhead Salmon (Fresh Wild Salmon served sizzling on a bed of roasted vegetables with Thai Chile butter sauce, topped with fried bay scallops and roasted grape tomatoes). The salmon flaked nicely and melted in my mouth, the grape tomatoes gave the dish an appropriate and subtle sweetness, and the scallops absorbed all of the surrounding juices and were therefore loaded with flavor. I was also impressed with the restaurant's staff who checked on my friend and I quite often to make sure our experience was optimal. The ambiance of the restaurant was also fun in that some people came here after work to sit at the bar and talk, giving the place a real Chicago steak house feel and at one point, an Ocean's 11 vibe as they played some lounge music. Overall, great experience, and I will come back again for one of their three course specials that they offer year-round for $39.
