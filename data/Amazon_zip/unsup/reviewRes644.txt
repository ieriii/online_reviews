"As good as it gets!" is yelp's definition of five stars. I don't think I have ever written a five star review for which that is so thoroughly true. I came to Chicago, 7 months pregnant (so the last vacation for awhile!) specifically to eat here. And was I ever satisfied! It's probably lucky for me that Alinea is in Chicago and not San Francisco, or else I would blow way way way too much money here on a regular basis.
