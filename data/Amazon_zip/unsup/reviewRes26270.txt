This is a solid 4 star. I had the Shrimp Satay and the Simply It's Beef "Luc Loc" The food is really good but I found it a little pricey. I can get the same quality dish for couple bucks less uptown. Oh well, the place and the service worth the couple extra bucks. I also like the fact that they serve fresh fruit as a complimentary dessert. It worths the try!
