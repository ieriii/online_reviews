The first time we tried to go here it was a Saturday afternoon and the hostess estimated a 1 hour wait. Sux We tried again on a Monday night and got seated right away. Yesss The service was just fine and the food was pretty alright. My caesar pizza had a crisp crust and tasted fresh. The gf's fish and chips was also tasty but maybe had a bit too much breading. The abundance of fries was welcome though. We had some beer of course and I will say that the Bottom Up Wit was amaaazing. Yuuuummy. We will be back again, just gotta make sure to pick the right night.
