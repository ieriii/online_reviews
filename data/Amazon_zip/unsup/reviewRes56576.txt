The quality of customer service is beyond exceptional. Arriving here is like arriving at some of the worlds finest hotels and checking in. They make you feel wanted and welcome. The staff know their wares very well. They are passionate about great steaks and it comes shining through. You really feel like a guest in someones home.  And the cherry on the top came after they called me the next day to thank me for having dinner there the night before. Very cool experience. Its worth every penny.
