Between the buzzing atmosphere, the well-balanced cocktails and the incredible appetizers I was won over. The rest of the culinary experience (i.e. main course and dessert) were not really memorable and this restaurant seemed to fall prey to a common affliction amongst fine-dining spots...tepid food, the latter point does really upset me but the infectiously laid back ambiance and the intriguing cuisine definitely win out. The sensory experience, including fragrance, lighting, and cuisine are changed for every season and I cannot help but want to go back and give it another go just to see what the chef has come up with. At least go to experience the cocktails and appetizers... Sitting at the bar until my table was ready I knew I was going to enjoy this place, it was stirring with excited conversation as Guns and Roses' "November Rain" played in the background.  My first cocktail, the Almond Paradise I believe it was called, was a delicious cucumber libation that was very light and refreshing which only made me more eager to find out what else this restaurant was going to offer; I tip my hat to the mixologist for setting a good tone for my meal. We ordered appetizers, main course and dessert, but I must say that the winner was most definitely the appetizers. The scallop came with a kind of German potato salad, it was cooked perfectly and was flavored very well. We also ordered sashimi which was very fresh and I enjoyed the combination of textures; the white tuna was paired with a crispy sesame cracker and avacado mousse. I was also impressed by their coffee. A table behind me was served their coffee whilst we were in the middle of our meal and the intoxicating aroma of rich, bold java coming from the mini french presses that it is served in teased my nostrils I looked forward to ordering my own when it came time for dessert. There were highs and lows, but overall I would say that this restaurant should be given a chance.
