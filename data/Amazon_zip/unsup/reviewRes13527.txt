I've driven by this place several times and figured this place was just a diner. My partner was craving Crab Legs recently so I did a Yelp search...all you can eat Crab Legs on Tuesday night at Glenn's? Good reviews? Ok, we had to give it a shot.... We stopped by on a Monday night without reservations and were seated right away. I do have to agree with the other Yelpers - you'll probably want to make reservations before heading out. I am not much of a seafood lover either but based on Yelpers recommendations, I went ahead and ordered a seafood dinner. Monday night's special was anything with a fin for $14.95 (or maybe $13.95? One of the two). I ordered the Mahi Mahi and my partner had the Tuna. Both were very fresh. The portions were generous. They were served with Asparagus and seasoned Red Potatoes. I found my Mahi Mahi to be a bit bland even with the Mango Salsa but I still enjoyed my meal. My partner had some sort of special Hollandaise with his tuna. It was spicy and he used it more for his vegetables than his tuna. The mussels are definitely good. They are served with delicious thick garlic bread. Mmm! I'd go on a day where they offer a special. It is a bit pricey but the quality is excellent. This is a pretty casual place and pretty small as well. Waitstaff is very attentive and friendly. They have Domestic Beers and a few special drinks on the menu (which includes special coffees). Street parking is available and gets difficult after 6:30pm, especially on a weekend. Be sure to carry a ridiculous amount of quarters with you anywhere now that the meters are ridiculously expensive.
