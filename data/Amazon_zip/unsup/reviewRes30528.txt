Got to have date night while visiting Chicago and we were stoked to find Sunda via Yelp. We did not have reservations, so we sat at a high table in the bar. Our table was reachable from the back side of the bar, so our drinks were always full as they could lean over and fill them without us even noticing. Living in California, I tend to not order sushi in landlocked states, I realize this is flawed thinking since most is flash frozen on the boat these days, but still... Our waitress was great and busy. Food was unique, fresh and tasty. The spicy was truly spicy. The dish we keep describing to friends was the duck. Served like a sushi roll, but on a bed of potatoes. Delightful. The escolar bite with the potato chip on top was delish. The main dining room seemed loud, but our little romantic table in the bar was the perfect mix of private conversation in the midst of a hip restaurant that made us feel part of the scene rather than the parents of 2 who usually stay home these days. Cheers!
