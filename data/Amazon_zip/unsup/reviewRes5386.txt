Fantastic. Personally, I thought this was much better than both the Bristol and the Publican in terms of food. Everything was really, really excellent. Nice ambiance, too. I would recommend the pork blade steak with 'nduja & honey - it's absolutely mind blowing. Crispy and charred on the outside, tender and flavorful on the inside, and a pretty decent sized serving, too. The pig's ear, arancini and brussel sprouts were also very good.  The cured meat platter and eggplant schmear were good, but not remarkable or noticably different from what you'd be served at other restaurants. My only beef is that the wine is not exactly cheap. The least expensive glass they had came in at $6 (the bulk is at $8 and up), and they actually ran out of it pretty early into the night - presumably because everyone else was drinking it, too.
