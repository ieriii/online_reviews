Don't you wish yelp allows half stars? 3.5 is more like it. I stopped by here with a friend for a quick bite before heading to Ontourage for a show. The sandwich was decent but honestly, maybe it's the viet in me but I prefer Nhu LAN. I also got their churros and they were not anything special to me. Good, not great.
