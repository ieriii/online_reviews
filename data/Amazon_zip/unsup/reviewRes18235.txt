We ventured over to Bad Apple with some friends after the Half Acre tour. This is the perfect place to go to if you want to continue your 'good beer' high. Just the list of what they have on draft is amazing, and the prices are great. A Great Lakes Dortmunder for $3.75? I don't mind if I do. If you can't find something on draft, their extensive bottle/can menu is impressive (and bigger than their food menu). We started with the cheese curds - wow. As someone who has spent a lot of time in WI... these really do curds justice. I'd go back just for those! I had the Frenchie burger and it was amazing. Sometimes with specialty burger places the patty is too large and I can barely get through a half once the snazzy toppings are added. This burger was perfectly sized so that I could enjoy the delicious burger and the great toppings (brie, spinach & truffle mayo - umm... yum!) Oh, and you can customize your fries. Extra truffle oil can't hurt anyone in my opinion, so why not put that on there too? =) I cannot wait to come back to this place and try some more of their specialty burgers and see what is new on draft.
