Like a scene from Alice in Wonderland. The tall back chairs you feel like you are in your own tiny island.  The drinks are great and the servers, while they take a while, are very informative and friendly. And the food is sooo tasty. I most highly recommend the duck meat balls and the banana, bacon, honey and nuts and peanut butter sandwich. While I most definitely miss Del Toro with all my heart, it is nice to have a classy upscale place that is worth the price in the neighborhood. I mean drinks are outrageously priced at Debonair and that place is a dump.
