With 3 locations to choose from within a 1 block radius...it looks like i luckily stumbled into the highest-rated one.  Fast, cheap, casual, no-frills, late-night mexican food is basically good to me no matter what (unless it's Flash Taco in the Wicker Park crotch - a place that even the trashiest of eaters dont seem to condone)...so La Pasadita is favorable in my book by default. The best part of La Pasadita is chips, pico, and 2 kinds of salsa (1 chipotle and 1 verde) on your table upon arrival! I gorged myself on those and ended up not having the space to help myself to a huge platter, so I got two tasty guacamole tacos instead - left full-stomached and happy, spent about $3.  Can't really complain.
