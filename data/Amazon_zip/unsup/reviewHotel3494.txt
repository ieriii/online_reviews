Updated Review: My credit card was credited back. So that's good. It's in a great location and decent. Just watch your credit card statement.  Old Review: BEWARE!!!!!! I prepaid my 2 night stay at the Allerton through Expedia. Allerton Hotel then proceeded to charge my credit card $160. I even confirmed during checkout that there were no charges to my room and everything was pre-paid. Then I came home to find a 160 dollar charge on my credit card from the Allerton Hotel.
