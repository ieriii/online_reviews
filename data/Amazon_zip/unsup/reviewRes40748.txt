The pho is indistinguishable from that of any random Thai restaurant that serves pho in Philadelphia, New York, Toronto, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Minneapolis, or any other city in which I've ordered pho. By indistinguishable, I mean that the broth, while clear, is bland; the meat, tough and overcooked. On a positive note, I liked the fruit at the top of the bubble tea.
