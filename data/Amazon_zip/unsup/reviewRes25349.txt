It has been years since I have been here but felt the need to review it anyway. This place is an authentic Greek restaurant and cafe. They have a full bar/coffee bar, bakery and full menu. I have tried the Greek coffee which was very good if you like very strong coffee. And for dinner I have always got the Yuvetsaki which is beef braised in a red wine tomato sauce over orzo pasta topped with Greek cheeses and served with lemons! Delicious!! And for dessert we always get the Loukoumades which are like little Greek doughnuts topped with honey and nuts...OMG so good!! Just writing this review makes me want to go back right now...I wish I lived closer! =[ But I will definitely be making my way back soon!
