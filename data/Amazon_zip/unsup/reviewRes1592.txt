Brought a Crossword puzzle to do in line with my wife and our friend Maggie. Had the Alligator Hot Dog, Foie Gras Hot Dog and the Cranberry & Cognac Smoked Chicken Sausage. SO AWESOME! Had 2 orders of the Duck Fries with Cheese as well. Worth it. Check the Hot Dougs website so you know what you want before you go and so you know what the weekly specials are. Don't sweat the line and enjoy!
