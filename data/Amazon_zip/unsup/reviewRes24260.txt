With a hot spot on south Michigan Avenue and dramatic interior design, you wish you could feel as though you were transported to Barcelona. But too many dishes were either bland or basic for this spot to be a real hit for me. The selection on the menu is impressive, and the dishes all SOUND appealing. We appreciated being able to split Mercat's gazpacho interpretation, made with golden tomatoes and enriched with a bit of crab and caviar. The briny flavor of the crab was lost a bit in the tomato base, though the contrast in textures was appealing. Grilled jumbo prawns arrived with their heads on - supposedly an indication of freshness - but several tasted heavily of iodine and one was so bad I had to discretely dispose of it in my napkin - too horrid to swallow. Grilled octopus was better, nicely charred and flavorful, if nothing special. The best dish of the evening was the cauliflower, with the pairing of currants and cauliflower complementing both. Flash-fried piquillo peppers with an almond dip sounded good, but the dip was a boring brown with no discernible almond flavor and the piquillos had no heat, just a vague herbaceous flavor tinged with oil. Tasting plate of 3 ice creams looked pretty, but none of the ice creams packed a punch, even on a hot late summer night.  Service was fine, if a bit "bossy", but none of the individual dishes stood out enough to make me want a repeat. There are lots of other great restaurants in Chicago, so I doubt I'd come back here again. It was just ... boring and bland.
