Always consistently Great! Have to say I've never had a bad experience at Mia's.  Food.... Service.... Atmosphere.... always above the norm I love everything from the pea pod and cucumber salad, carpaccio, any of their pastas especially the ones that include the sausage (yum) Of course desert is a must! One of the fun things about this restaurant is you'll always spot a face you recognize! I've never been there when it hasn't been crowded, so reservations definitely needed. It may be a little bit over the top in crowds and noise for some, but as long as you go expecting this you won't be disappointed by the overall experience.
