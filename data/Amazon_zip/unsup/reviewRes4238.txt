5 stars for late hours (4-5 am many nights) and amazing jazz even that early in the morning. The musicians are extremely talented and they play with passion. For me, that is the most important part. The drinks are mediocre, the staff can be rude, and seating is a major challenge, but the music! I could go on for days about how good the jazz is.
