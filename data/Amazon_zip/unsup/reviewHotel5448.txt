Sorry... I am a total hotel snob. This is an ok place. The best thing about it is the location. The beds are comfortable, but not like Westin's heavenly bed. The mattresses have to be replaced, as they are just too soft. The lobby is tiny and cramped. The bathrooms are big, but need serious updating. The rooms are actually quite large and there was a great view of Barney's. It made me smile. Toiletries are ehhh... although their oatmeal soap is scented with rose oil (I think), which is quite lovely. Lots of hot water. Good shower water pressure. Fresh orchids in the bathroom... my favorite. Overall, I think this place needs a major facelift. But the location is fantastic and the people who work here are very nice and cheerful.
