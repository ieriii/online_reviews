Great service. Lunch entrees were superb. Very lovely pizza, salad, and I had the salmon on spinach. Very wonderful. Our apple tart desert was a bit of a disappointment ( all crust no apples). But it's easy to overlook when the food and service make you feel like it's worth it to pay. This isn't a a feeling we get that often in the River North area, to be honest..
