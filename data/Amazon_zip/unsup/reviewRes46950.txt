No valet parking but there was plenty of street parking on Devon. The entrance is on Devon through the metal gates. We (as well as a few others) sort of wondered around looking for the door. Anyway... The Carrot and Zucchini croquettes apps were good, especially the dill tzatziki. I would recommend the beet salad, however. The Cassoulet with sausage was out of this world. Beans perfectly cooked and a respectable spiciness to the sausage. I strongly recommend. If you are not into this idea, I would recommend the rabbit which was perfectly cooked. PS: We brought a 3 week old baby here for an early dinner. I was worried, but then the ambiance is nice and dark, with decent white noise. Also, I was relieved to see that a few others brought younger children here. The waitstaff were very cool with this and not snooty about it at all. It didn't matter because he slept the whole time anyway.
