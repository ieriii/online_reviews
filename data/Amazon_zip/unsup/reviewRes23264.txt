Delicious food and beautiful restaurant in Greektown. Feta was the best I have ever had. Gyros are delish. Too much food! Surprisingly enough they have good Tiramusu here. Who knew? It is their version of it. A little lighter than the Italian style but just as good. The building itself is cool! Lots of little nooks and crannies and steps, as if you were in Greece. Each dining section has a different look, feel, and style to it. Interesting.
