This is place is fantastic and truly a bargin for the quality. I was very pleasantly surprised.  Salad: The Chopped Salad is probably the best chopped salad I've ever had. It has all regular ingredients plus mexican tortilla - which was an unexpected treat.  Entree: The Bone-In Char-crusted Ribeye with Peppercorn Sauce. Excellent. Probably the best steak I've ever had and it was only $32 and probably 20 ounces. It was cooked to perfection and I had enough for breakfast the next month. Yummy. Sides: Au Gratin Potatoes tasted just like my southern mother's...made me nostalgic for home. I didn't start with an Appetizer or finish with Dessert and I must say I'm glad. The portions are so generous you really don't need more than your entree. This is definitely on my list of favorites and I will be back many more times.
