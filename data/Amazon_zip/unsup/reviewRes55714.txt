I have been going to Sabitinos for over 10 years, mainly for lunch. The Chicago classic interior has not changed in probably 50 years. The food is a mixture of Itailian, Greek and American dishes and represent the best of values. This place is great to have a good meal and conversation. Not overly fancy but just pure Chicago! Wish they would serve the sirloin tips more often.
