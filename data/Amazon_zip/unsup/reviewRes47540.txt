After I checked out the menu for this place i'm even more upset/sad with the service that we received. We had a larger party of 30 and a private room. We were told about some of the meats so were expecting lots of deliciousness. For reasons unknown to me our table kept getting skipped and passed over. They made sure they went to the parents table, and to the table next to them. But continuously skipped ours. We literally waited over 30 minutes for the next meath skewers to come. We asked repeated for the venison, we finally got it after we were served dessert. One of the parents told us that they got it really early on in their meal. :( So sad because it was one of the best ones. never got the wagyu beef, red snapper, or the crab cakes. sigh.. In order of favorites was venison, lamb, pork belly, dont' remember between the beefs, and the duck was my least favorite. I kept asking for meat. I have never been to a brazilian bbq place and left hungry and wanting more meat. I was sad because I thought their food was pretty darn tasty. One of our waitresses was amazing, remembered my drink and always brought out what we asked for. The other waitress (some chick with short blond hair) was awful, one of my cousins ordered a drink and never received it. She also purposefully slowed down our drink orders and told us we were allowed to only have one drink a person. Then proceeded to count each drink and find out which person had what drink in order for us to order another. I thought that was ridiculous, and then she started to take our drinks away before we were done with us. If we weren't sitting there, our drinks would disappear. I loved the fact that they had a shuttle bus to get us all home safely. Sad that the roof top bar got too crowded for us all to go up after even though we had a reservation.
