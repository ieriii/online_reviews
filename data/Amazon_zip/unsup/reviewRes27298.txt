This place was nothing like I expected, and not in a good way. Having read reviews of the whimsical preparations and creativity this restaurant offered, we made reservations and opted for the 10 course tasting menu. We've been to restaurants like this before, it's nothing new to us. We knew the portions would be small. I had no idea, however, they'd be this small. The flavors weren't that good, the preparations were not terribly inventive. If you are going to spend this kind of money and want something original, try Moto, the flavors and dishes are way more interesting IMO. The service was great, however, way better than the forgettable meal itself, We went within a couple weeks of the new chef starting, maybe they are still feeling ti out. That said, I doubt we will be back to find out
