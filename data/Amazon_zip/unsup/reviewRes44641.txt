Having tried Gino's East, Giordano's, and Zachary's, Little Star, and Patxi's (in the SF Bay Area), I can't say Giordano's is the best. Sure, it was good, but for me, a bit too much cheese. I like the stuffing and each bite was full of sausage, onions, and green peppers. As with any deep dish, it's hard to eat more than two slices. A small size could potentially feed 3 people here. A good pizza, but good to know that my Bay Area choices can satisfy my cravings for deep dish.
