This place does not help my indecisiveness. Since I was a kid, I've usually had only a few options to choose from. Well, when the whole menu is veg and everything is just plain good, I have to play the elimination game... of 'eeny meeny miny moe'. Joking, of course. (Well, mostly.) But it's nice to have a place where you have so many options. I've tried numerous things on the menu, and everything has been great. I'm really fond of the Buddha Burger (I sub chez for avocado) and one of the specials I've had different variations of, a breaded chik cutlet with pesto mayonaise, arugula, and some veggies. Last time I went I tried the Hum Botanical Spirit and Soda. It tasted very herbally and a little bit like hippie sweat... but I like it and had 3.
