With a sushi-loving friend visiting from L.A., I finally had the perfect opportunity to try Wakamono. We stepped into the chic eatery and were seated within minutes. The muted lighting sets the stage for a romantic dinner or in our case, a relaxed atmosphere in which to catch up with a longtime friend. Walking in with a brown paper bag (contents: La Crema Pinot Noir) felt a bit gangster considering the sophisticated setting, but it took me only about 2 minutes to get over it. Wakamono is BYO which presents the consummate excuse to splurge on a nicer bottle of wine. Spending $20-$25 is almost negligible when you consider you'd be paying in the $50-$75 range with the requisite restaurant mark-up! We ordered the tuna dip with avocado and wonton crackers as our first course. Delectable, honest-to-goodness bliss of an appetizer. Next, we ordered two 'contemporary maki' rolls: the Snow White roll (super white tuna and avocado) and the Make Mexicano (yellowtail, cilantro, jalapeno, spicy sauce, avocado, and lime). Both were fresh and ingeniously divine-- the Mexicano was a little heavy on the cilantro but nonetheless fantastic. Everyone was chatty compliments of their own heavy pours of vino, but the music was never overly loud (contrary to what many of the other reviews mention). Our server, while more than satisfactory, was a bit aloof and didn't refill our water once she dropped off the check. And I was parched, courtesy of the spicy Mexicano maki! Can't wait to return and make my way through the beautiful Wakamono's repertoire of imaginative maki. Hopefully better service will catapult the experience to one deserving of 5 stars. Even their website is flawless-- check it.
