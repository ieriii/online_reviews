My wife & I had been wanting to try this place for a while, so we went rather late on a Wednesday night. It was nearly empty when we arrived, but, oddly, by the time we left, had quite a few people there. I had the stuffed cabbage with polenta & thought it was great. My wife had the schnitzel with spaetzle & it was also great. Will definitely be back.  I had a Romanian Merlot, which you should probably skip. They have a good beer selection. My wife had the sangria, which was quite good & refreshing. She had the apple struedel with gelato & caramel sauce for dessert & it is HIGHLY recommended. The owner is very accomodating, visiting each table, but is one "wild & crazy guy". The server seemed new, but the service was good. Be warned that they add the tip to your bill without notice. We will be back!
