Reserved a king guest room, but got a two twins(or double or whatever this is) instead. I'm just one person, what am I suppose to do with two small beds? Apparently they ran out, but what happened to the fact that I reserved it? Room is rather cramped. - Didn't inform me about the bed situation at the desk when I picked up my keys. Upon actually getting into the room I had to call them. I was then told that they ran out and they can move me tomorrow if I don't unpack. Since I'm only staying for 2 days, that's pretty much pointless. - Desk is stuck in a dark corner with no lights.  - Radio/iPhone/iPod dock is broken - it has trouble connecting my iPhone, the connection is loose - Makeup mirror is loose and won't stay in place - Front desk when called not very friendly - The view from outside my window is a dark alley.... - Didn't provide internet passcode at the desk when I'm getting the keys. - The light switch to the bathroom is broken off at the end (still functional thankfully!) Hopefully this list will not grow more as I endure the next 36 hours I'll be here...... I've been to many many hotels in my life in many different countries, this has been the most disappointing yet. Not going to come back here next time I'm in Chicago.
