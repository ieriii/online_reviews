Publican, I love what you do, you just need to do it better. There are quite a few complaints about waiting and reservations being messed up. This is a hard thing to bitch about unless you have experienced it several times. Service was fine, friendly and efficient. Although when asking how something was prepared the server was very ignorant of the cooking technique used. Half the food was great, the other half was mediocre, it is depressing to see such ingredients so twisted, and convoluted. Keep it simple, stop trying to show how cutting edge you are and you will gain a couple of stars, I will return, but not til next year. Beer list is fantastic.
