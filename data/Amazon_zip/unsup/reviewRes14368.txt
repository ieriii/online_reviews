This place is just around the corner from my house and I love it. The food is excellent (both dinner and breakfast) and there is something in all price ranges. It has some of the beast seafood in the city. Everything is really fresh and you can tell because sometime they run out of things. But that is the price you pay for good seafood. I'd much rather go someplace that runs out of selections than someplace that has had the same thing sitting in the freezer for a week. The only real downside is that because everything is good and the restaurant is small, reservations are basically required. IYou must try the maple pecan pie a la mode.
