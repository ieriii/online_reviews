I was really excited to try this new restaurant in my neighborhood.  I was kind of disappointed. We got bud's buffalo and the original bad boy buddha. The bad boy buddha came cold - i totally didnt expect that. I just didn't like it because of that - I felt like I was eating ketchup with rice and vegetables. The chicken was okay - and the sauce normal. Just didn't love it. And felt it was kind of expensive too for what I got.
