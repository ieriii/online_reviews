This was my first try at Cuban food, and I LOVE it. According to my BF who is part Cuban this was not completely authentic but to me it was as good as it gets. Service was impeccable, food was fresh, good, sophisticated and trendy at the same time. The ambiance was the most surprising, when you drive up to the restaurant it looks like nothing special, but when you walk in the place is huge, beautifully decorated, and plays lively Cuban music. (yes I have heard Gloria!) I didn't get to try their wine or any of the drinks, but by just glancing at the menu I can see that it would have been something wonderful. For everyone who goes, please try the Cuban Sampler as an appetizer, that was one of the best things I have had in a while! Overall highly recommend it, the place is great.
