i was unfortunate enough to order chicken salad for lunch from this place. Considering that i had ordered from this place twice before and been disappointed, i should have remembered right ? No So this review is for the lunch salad delivery. considering the price i paid, it was a shame. I like small plates but this place is a shame.
