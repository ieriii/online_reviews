We like this romanian restaurant. We have been there on several occasions. Food was always great (my favorite - veal paprikac, their signature dish - stuffed chicken), very good romanian wine "Dracula's blood" at very reasonable price. good live music. good place for groups gathering and casual dining. Charming owner Branco gave us as a gift a bottle of wine. We like this place and would highly recommend it!
