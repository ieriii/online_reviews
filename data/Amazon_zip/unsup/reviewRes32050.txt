Finally checked this place out. Saw Billy Dec in his usual gear... random tshirt and a hat. He was eating with the commoners which was pretty cool of him... except he was right in the front when you walk in so maybe he did that on purpose to be seen or something. Anyway, the food was great. The prices are kind of jacked up for the same thing you'd find somewhere else but if I had to review this place as a whole, it's pretty good. Service was attentive and the food was good enough (nothing amazing but good enough... cause honestly, how much better can it get than japonaise or any other restaurant like this one). If you're in the mood to spend some money or impress a lady, come to this place and go nuts. I don't have any must try items on the menu except for the lobster and wagyu roll... which is $20. I think it's worth $20... I think... Oh... try to stay away from the communal tables... they're super uncomfortable. It's definitely a last resort kind of thing.  Am I coming back? Maybe... when I'm richer.
