I'd never heard of Nana prior to this weekend when a friend who lives in the neighborhood took me there. We ordered the watermelon/beet salad which was refreshing and delicious. We also ordered the Sunday Supper--I didn't really look at the description of the meal that closely before we ordered and then when it arrived, it was like an embarrassment of riches. The chicken was good as were the biscuits but I especially loved the grilled veggies and slaw and mac and cheese--my goodness. A lot of restaurants somehow fail at mac and cheese--too bland or runny--but not Nana Organic. Between the desserts available to us I think I preferred the ice cream sandwich with the honey ice cream to the PB&J cake but overall it was a delicious, beautiful meal with friendly service to boot. My only wish is that there was a North Side branch!
