We had to wait for about an hour to get in on a Saturday night, which I expected. However, I was told that they would take our phone numbers so we could leave in the meantime, and they weren't doing that. So the entryway was a little crowded. But once we got in, it was very nice--I liked the atmosphere (very low lighting and candles--although a little too low to read the menu) and it was fun getting to know other people at our table. As far as drinks go, we really liked the Part and Parcel and the Hush and Wonder. I would definitely go back!
