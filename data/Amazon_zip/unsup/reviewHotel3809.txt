Maybe the staff at the desk read some of these reviews; they were friendly and helpful during our 3-day visit. My complaint about this hotel is that, under the trendy and slightly pretentious veneer, there's an air of neglect. A case in point would be the remote that didn't work, and the two phones ditto. The impact of the ubiquitous granite everywhere is undermined by cheap furniture underneath. The amazing views are obscured by the big TV, desk lamps, and a truly horrible tangle of wires below. Not pretty at all. But we got a super deal and we liked the staff, the bedding, the bed, the view, the shower, and the location.
