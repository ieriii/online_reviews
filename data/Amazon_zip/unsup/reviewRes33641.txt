Several vegan options, including falafel, rice and lentils, lentil soup, tabboule, hummus and baba ghanooj. Falafel sandwich is (usually) great, though on occasion it has been way too watery from the Jerusalem salad. Prices are very good compared to the rest of the neighbourhood. Service has been on and (more often than not) off for the past couple years. It used to be a lot more reliable. At busy times the food is just slopped together. Best to visit during off hours.
