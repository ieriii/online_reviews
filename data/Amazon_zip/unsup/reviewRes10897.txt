For me, it's a shame the place itself is so obnoxiously loud because the pizza is so good. My guess is the high ceilings contribute to the noise level, but I don't enjoy places like this at all. My boyfriend and I went with another couple and we were constantly having to repeat ourselves. The whole point of going out to eat with them is to catch up and when it's that hard to hear one another, it's no fun and really kind of pointless. We started with the chips & salsa and goat cheese appetizers. At $5.95, don't waste your money on the chips & salsa and save room to eat more pizza. For less you could either make or buy salsa that's just as good, if not better. If you enjoy goat cheese (I apparently don't) you'll probably like this one. The real star of the show for me is the pizza (which now ranks #2 on my pizza list). As I really don't care for red sauces, a huge plus in my book is that one of their base pizzas is white. Topped with spinach and ricotta--amazing. I tried a piece of a red pizza that was also ordered and while fine, I wanted to hoarde that white pizza all for myself. I don't remember what sizes we ordered, but whatever the case, beware that the prices really add up when you start getting toppings.  If you want to eat here during dinner, I highly recommend making reservations. We got there at 7pm on a weeknight and were told it'd be an hour wait. We got lucky and got a seat in probably half that time or less, but I wouldn't count on it.
