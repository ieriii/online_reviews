All the quotation marks in the menu make me laugh. "This Cheeeezeburger is delicious." I went vegan for two years and looked forward to every visit to the Chicago Diner. Having gone back to being an omnivore, I have to say I still genuinely enjoy this place.  I've gorged on the seitan tacos innumerable times, and tried the delicious huevos mexicanas over the weekend.  And their raw desserts must be good for you because they're raw, so I don't feel bad binging here. They have a fantastic menu all around, but their desserts and milkshakes are really good too.  I'm a repeat customer for life.
