6 of us went here for NYE. The restaurant was packed but we managed to get a reservation 4 days in advance. We shard some amazing sushi rolls as an appetizer. The best being Tale of 2 Tunas and a Lobster/Wagyu Roll (mouth watering delicious).  This was the first time I ever had Kobe beef (the ribeye for $49). It was amazing. A buttery and tender texture that I've never experienced before. Cooked perfectly and sliced nice and thin. I tried a bite of everyones dishes and was pretty impressed for the most part. The pork confit was crispy, juicy and amazing and the crispy cauliflower was unique and delicious. The shaking beef was a little over-flavored and a little salty but tender. Service was good and the staff was knowledgable. Pricey for sure, but what do you expect, it's Chicago and Sunda is probably the most trendy place in the city right now. I couldn't eat there every week or even every month (only b/c of the price), but I would love to go back.
