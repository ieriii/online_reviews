How did I neglect to give this great place a review? Starving, and with my daughter in tow, we bee-lined it over to Pasta Bowl for an early dinner. Fast and friendly service, tasty and I am sure fattening pasta (but who cares) and 45 minutes later we rubbed our full tummies and vowed to come back again soon. Tortellini with tomato cream sauce. Penne with Arrabiatta (spicier if you want it so), fresh bread, and never ending water, we find this to be a bulls-eye every time. 5 stars if they had a sexier dining room.
