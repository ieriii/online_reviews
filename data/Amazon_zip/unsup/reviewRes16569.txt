This place is AMAZING! If you want to get Indian cuisine between LaSalle and Michigan Ave, this is the place to go! We went to another Indian restaurant in that area that had gotten stellar reviews and we *walked out* when we saw that they had listed quinoa and noodles on the menu. Quinoa and noodles are NOT traditional Indian dishes. Run, don't walk, out the door if you see such a thing. I digress... India House had a wonderful buffet that Sunday with more than a dozen main dishes, plus rice and tableside naan and tandoori chicken. It had many different types of dishes (curries, subzi) featuring fish, chicken, vegitarian, and lamb. The dishes all equally excelled in spice level and quality, which is something that I find very rare in buffet type places. There were three different desserts (gulab jamun, mango kulfi, and kheer). All three were amazingly delicious and not sickeningly sweet. There was also an ample salad bar with the usual chutnies, as well as some nice achar, fresh veggies and fruits. This place is an amazing oasis of real ethnic food in this area of Chicago--we didn't want to drive up to Devon Street since we were planning on doing shopping afterwards. After being disappointed by two restaurants pedaling inauthentic ethnic cuisine (Indian, Thai, and Chinese) in this area, we were so thankful to find this place.
