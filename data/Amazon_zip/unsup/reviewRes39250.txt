Went here with an old friend I hadn't seen in over five years, and our waiter Ryan was immediately attentive to the fact that we were here to catch up and enjoy a long friendly meal and conversation. He paced the plates perfectly, and even expressed his concern that the pumpkin ravioli came too soon as we hadn't quite cleared the grape apple salad. We didn't send a single plate back with a spot of food or sauce on it... and even licked the bowl of the pumpkin ravioli clean, it was like an f'n dessert mid-meal!!!  Back to the beginning, we started with the meatballs over polenta... the polenta was whipped super light and it's creaminess complimented the super meaty meatballs perfectly. From there things only got better. We split the grape and apple salad and moved onto the pumpkin ravioli... (I am going back later this week just to have this dish once again!) I cannot even begin to describe it, other than what I wrote above. Finally we finished with the Steak and Eggs... The "sunny side up" or soft cooked egg was perfectly cooked inside the perfectly cooked, and I assume home-made ravioli wrapper... (or whatever you call that deliciously al-dente wheat based skin...) Come dessert, WTF, I cannot remember dessert... I remember it was really really good, but we were food comatose by this point and in sheer bliss... I checked out the menu online... We shared the warm gruyere donuts... again, f'n amazing! Ryan our awesome waiter brought us an aperitif gratis and shared a few (more) laughs with us while we enjoyed the drinks before serving us with the check, which was beyond reasonable for such an amazing experience in life & food!  Cheers L&E we'll see you soon, if not sooner!
