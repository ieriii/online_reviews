Pretty cozy spot in Gold Coast, it very missable too because it looks like its hiding. I like the freedom you have in there to do anything you want it seems. If you feel like eating and studying there for 7 hours, you can! You feel like having a drawing marathon? You can! Just remember to order at least one cup of coffee. I guess they also have rotating artists who put up work there and live guitarist during the week sometime...I can do without both elements. The food is surprisingly good and it seems like a lot of tortured poets, and artists dine and work there. I also love that they have a full service bar that serves alcohol no matter what time of day. I definately prefer the upper dining area.
