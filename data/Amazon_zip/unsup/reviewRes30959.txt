OMG, who do they think they are?? This restaurant was awful, we were not greeted at the door for sometime or until we seated ourselves and the food took forever along with the coffee which was weak. The food was so so my grits had hot hot peppers in them I thought I ordered grits with cheese but got some kind of mexican hot stuff in them. This is actually a Mexican Breakfast place hot and spicy and so so over priced for the neighborhood. Wow. Let's stop with the $3.00 for coffee and no refill either. omlette with only one toast for $11.00 never again. go to Mele's it's great. jeanne
