Theres a reason why this place is always packed. it has good food, its as simple as that. Ive been to this place 3x. The first time, I had pasta and it was really good. The second time I ordered the specials which really didnt blow me away and the third time I had the pork chops which were just ok. My personal lesson, stick wih the pasta and risotto dishes coz they really are good. Try the Budino for dessert it is light and heavenly. If you want rustic traditional authentic italian dishes this is the place to go.
