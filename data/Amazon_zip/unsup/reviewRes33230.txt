As you walk in the Decor is very pleasant and welcoming. The service was attentive but could have been more personalble. The food was excellent I enjoyed the the Borscht Soup and also we tried the The Short Rib and it was very appealing to my taste pallete. The band started up the night as we were almost done ( we got there kind of early) to expierence the band I say be there at 8:00 pm. The owner stopped by and greeted us he is very welcoming. I'll be Back after 8:00 pm ! enjoy!!!
