Tapas galore -- the Purple Pig is the joint to be at if you want to stuff yourself with casual, unique, appetizing, fun and eclectic food! The food here is prepared fresh and you can taste it with every bite you take from the various dishes. The flavors are simple yet bold and each ingredient of the dish is highlighted very nicely. The flavor combinations, for the most part, worked together and had a great balance. Here's how I would rate the ones I tried: --Tuscan Kale & Romaine Caesar Salad With Hard Boiled Quail Egg - 3/5 --Porchetta with Salsa Verde - 3.5/5 --Milk Braised Pork Shoulder with Mashed Potatoes - 4.5/5 --Mussels with Pancetta, Crme Fraiche & Marjoram - 4/5 --Roasted Bone Marrow with Herbs - 4/5 --Eggplant Caponata with Goat Cheese - 3.5/5 --Eggplant Parmesan Balls - 3/5
