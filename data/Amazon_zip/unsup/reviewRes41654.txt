I agree with Bob T. "Don't snack before"! I went there for lunch with co-workers and ordered the steak sandwich which comes with fries. I have to say that all at the table gasped at the size and needless to say I could only finish half. It was delicious, though, and I feasted on the other half for dinner. The waitstaff was attentive and friendly. I only give it 4 stars because of my co-workers complaints of the butter drizzled on their steaks; don't know, looked good to me. Prices were competitive with other steak houses in Chicago. I will be back!
