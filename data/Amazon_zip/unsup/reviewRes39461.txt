Korean BBQ can be a little daunting if you're new to it, especially if the place is more authentic, because that sometimes means English speakers may have trouble communicating with the staff. Which is no reason to be put off, you can get your message through by pointing at things on the menu and using your fingers to indicate numbers. The money still spends, right? The staff at San Soo Gab San seem to communicate better; the place seems more welcoming to non-Koreans than some of the other joints around. It also seems to attract a more rowdy crowd of hipsters. I'm not making a value call on this, just an observation that may be of use to others. It is what it is. All I care about is the food, and the food here is pretty terrific. I found the meat to be more tender and flavorful than other places I've tried. The ban chan were plentiful and good, but I like the assortment at Cho Sun Ok better; Cho Sun Ok has a few favorites that I crave at random moments, and they didn't get served up here. The seafood pancake, though, was worth the whole trip. Service was excellent, especially as crowded as it was. The hostess was blunt with us when we were hanging out too long finishing our wheat tea; she loudly asked us when we were planning on leaving. Didn't mind that, as it was crowded and there was a line out front. We were being pretty lazy about getting our show on the road, so fair is fair. If that kind of thing upsets you, get over yourself. The world doesn't revolve around you. You shouldn't feel entitled to hog a booth in a popular restaurant for three hours just because you feel like it. I hate you. If that kind of thing doesn't upset you, let's be BFF 4-ever LOL ;P
