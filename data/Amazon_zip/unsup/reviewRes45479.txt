The place is pretty inside, but that's pretty much where the good stuff stops for me. 1. The service was horrible. Nearly twenty minutes passed between the time we got seated and our entire party arrived and when the server finally came by to take our orders. When the order finally came, my fiance had to ask the server three times for tartar sauce to go with her fish & chips and one of the people joining us had to ask multiple times for the sauce that was supposed to come on his burger. 2. The food was overpriced and mediocre at best. My meat loaf was barely warm and about as tasty as mud. Granted, I have never tasted mud but it seems a safe guess. The fish and chips was okay, just okay. other people at my table mentioned that their food was acceptable but not much more than that. My other problem was the portions. it seems that for the amount of money we spent, we should received a bit more. Between the lousy service and the sub-par food, we will not be back.
