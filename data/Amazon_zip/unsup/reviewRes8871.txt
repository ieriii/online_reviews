I've been coming here ever since I saw them on Check Please years ago and have taken almost all of my friends here for some special occassion or another. The food and service has always been excellent and I have never once been disappointed. Cheaper than Reza's and definitely more flavorful! My fav appetizer (in addition to the free feta, beet and onion plate they give every table) is the Oloveih, which is similar to a chicken salad that you eat with pita bread but 10x better! I usually get the shrimp and chenjeh (ribeye) combo which also comes with a side of grilled tomatoes, onions and green peppers and your choice of white, dill or white/dill rice. I love that the servers ask you what temperature you want the meat to be and its never too tough or dry. The shrimp has a light flavor but squeeze a little bit of lemon on and it helps intensify the flavor. This is really fattening but I also love to melt the butter onto the rice (which has a light sprinkle of saffron). A meal for two people (appetizer and two entrees) usually costs us about $35 + tip and tax which is pretty decent for a nice Friday dinner but the awesome thing is that Noon O Kabob is now part of http://restaurant.com. You can now get a $25 gift certificate for $3 (use a 70% off coupon code) - minimum purchase is only $35 (versus $50 at other restaurant).
