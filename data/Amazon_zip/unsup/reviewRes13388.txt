We love us some craft brews and Rev's seasonal Saison Coup D'Etat is #1 on our list. Food Highlights include the Smokehouse burger with pulled pork, Hombre Burger and Arugula pizza.  The large central bar, beer barrel walls, peek-thru to the brewery, tin ceiling and sweet light fixtures make for a casual, warm, clean, pleasant, and fun atmosphere. tip: not the best for intimate conversations as restaurant gets noisy when full!
