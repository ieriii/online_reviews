For a long dark period of my life I was ordering a stuffed crust pizza from here twice a week all for myself. It was probably my favorite stuffed crust pizza in Chicago. Much better when it first arrives than reheated in my opinion though. Which is why I would typically try to eat it all in one sitting- then lay on my couch in agony unable to move. But I have not ordered from here since finding a large hunk of glass in one of my pizzas. Actually my boyfriend was the lucky one to bite into it. It was over 2 inches by 1 inch- looking like a pint glass broke most likely. Anyways it was two days after I had had it delivered when he bit into this crazy nugget of near death- I called Giordano's to notify them that perhaps they should be a bit more careful in what ingrediants they are adding in their pizzas. The manager we spoke with us was rude and told us simply he couldn't give us a refund since it had been 2 days- um, we didn't ask for a refund, just wanted to make sure they were aware of a dangerous situation. I don't think there was even an I'm sorry. Ordering pizzas now that won't cut me thank you.
