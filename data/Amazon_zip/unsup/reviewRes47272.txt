First things first: check your Yelp app on your phone as the Lockdown Bar & Grill usually has a check-in offer for a free draft beer! Score! Second: HOLY SMOKES THE BURGERS HERE ARE AMAZING. Third: Lockdown usually offers 1/2 price burgers every Tuesday (follow them on Facebook for updates & offers... they are really good about letting you know when they are offering awesome deals.) Fourth: Their mac & cheese is made from scratch & just as amazing as their burgers. You can build your own mac & cheese (or pay the extra $2 & try it with your burger; totally worth it. So much food you'll be asking for a take-home box!) Last but not least: Veggie burger is homemade, huge, flavorful & they will either build your veggie burger to order or you can substitute a veggie burger (or turkey burger) on any of their fun, tasty burgers. Vegetarian tip: if you get the mac & cheese with your burger, ask them to make it without bacon. I had no idea they even would do this until the awesome waitress last night offered it to me. Side-note: Love the decor of this place (skulls & bones & blaring music & usually some sort of live concert on the multiple TVs...) Waitstaff are laid back & hip; very friendly. The Lockdown is kitty-corner across from The Empty Bottle, so this place is perfect to have dinner & drinks before a show.
