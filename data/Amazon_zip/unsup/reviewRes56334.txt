Ate at Simply It last night with a group of friends after reading about it in Time Out Chicago, as one of a few restaurants whose owners are in debt given tough economic times and should be experienced. We were very happy with the service! There are over 60 items on the menu & our server gave us great recommendations - portion size was ample. Great for date night or groups. Not loud for dinner conversation. Everyone should check out this undiscovered gem!
