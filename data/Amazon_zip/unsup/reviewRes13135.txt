Went last night to clebrate my birthday with a few friends. The only negative I can thing of is the price. A group of five and about 2 drinks per person (only 5 drinks were alcohol) came to a hair under $300!!! (GASP) However, they were really cool about the fact that we were an hour late for our reservation ( stuck in traffic) and seated us as soon as our entire party had arrived. It wasnt very busy and we did recieve excellent service. Unfortunately, our table was in a corner so most of the guachos sorta passed us by but our waiter (Roberto) made sure if we wanted anything that he's send someone over immediately. THe decor was very nice and while half our party was dressed up and the other half dressed down we were all still comfortable and didnt feel over/under dressed. THe drinks are also very strong (IMHO) so if youre a lite drinker you may want to go for something fruity. I would definitely go back when I have a 50% off coupon. Like I said it's a great place, the service is excellent and the guys running around are VERY easy on the eyes (sorry I didnt pay the ladies any attention so I couldnt comment on them) : ) Make sure you bring an extra credit card just in case you dont have enough cash on hand.lol. Bon appetite. PS- If you're torn on what to get for dessert go with the chocolate mousse cake....its a chocolate lover's dream and big enough for 2 people.
