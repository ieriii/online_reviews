Neither fancy nor upscale, but great food served by nice people. This is the best Cuban food I have found outside of Miami. Well prepared food, helpful service, cheerful ambiance, and an overall friendliness. It was a very cold December night, and we greatly enjoyed the warmth of this dining experience.
