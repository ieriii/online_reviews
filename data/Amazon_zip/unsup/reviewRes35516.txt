** Sunday Brunch Review ** If we could give 10 Stars to Shaw's for their Sunday Brunch, that might not even be enough. This may have been one of the best meals we have ever had at this price. If you are a fan of Seafood and Brunch, this is the ABSOLUTE BEST.  Let's start with the Brunch Items. Made to order omelettes that you can add crab meat or shrimp or lobster; made to order Belgian waffles with all the toppings; scrambled eggs, carmelized bacon, potatoes au'gratin, French Toast with Bananas Foster toppings and sauce, crepes. Seafood Bar that had unlimited oysters on the half shell, cold shrimp (this was the best shrimp I've ever had), blackened shrimp, shrimp salad, crab meat salad with some frut (looked good), Alaskan King Crab pieces (cold) and Alaskan King Crab (hot with melted butter, the King Crab is simply excellent and cut into nice 1-2" pieces in the shell, smoked Salmon, Salmon Pastrami, Maki Rolls with Tuna, Halibut, Salmon. Buffet had roasted Halibut (best Halibut I've ever had, anywhere), roasted Turkey Breast, roasted Beef Tenderloin (that was a good as my Fillet at Gibson's the night before), Lobster Bisque, Breaded Shrimp (did I already say this Shrimp was incredibly good), Lobster Pasta, Crab Cakes.  Our Service was excellent, the server was never more than 10-15' from our table. Coffee was great. He brought us a piece of chocolate cake with candles (Anniversary weekend) and took our picture with our camera.  Did I mention Desserts? Too many to mention and at that point who can eat desert? This place really is the absolute best Sunday Brunch we've evern been to....Including Mother's Day and Easter Brunch at Signature Room, Hyatt, Clubhouse, etc....all more expensive that this too.  I am now a huge fan of Shaw's......will make the trip in Chicago just for brunch !!!!
