We had such an amazing experience at Srrout. My husband and I go out to eat often and can be picky. We thought the food was unbelievable as well as the service. I got the scallops and wagyu which were both amazing and my husband got the octopus and short ribs. He said the short ribs were probably the ebst he's ever had!! Dessert were unusual and delicious! I HIGHLY recommend trying this restaurant!
