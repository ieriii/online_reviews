Update: Lost a star. Went a second time and were less impressed. They took the cauliflower steak off the menu. The pasta we ordered (Riccio di Mare e Granchio) also failed to impress as much. ----------------------------------- What a find. Amazing food and at a reasonable price. Loved everything we ordered. The Octopus is a must-have. The Cauliflower steak is amazing. The Truffle egg toast... I could go on. Good wine list and competitive prices. The restaurant has a wonderful ambiance, service staff is extremely welcoming and we will definitely be back.
