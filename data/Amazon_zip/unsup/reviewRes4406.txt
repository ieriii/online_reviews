What else can I say about the Green Mill, except that it is legendary, the music is always out of this world, service is straightforward, and nicely poured drinks. If I have to be picky, my only complaints is the selection of beers on tap. But then again, if you're sitting in Green Mill, having a great night, you don't really care. Now, if you're going to Fat Cat, then that's another story.
