We went here with a big group of friends old friends hoping to catch up. Unfortunately they sat us at a long table, instead of one of the nice circular ones on the side, so talking was quite difficult. The interior was nice and the service was very good. Food was mixed. I'm cheap and so I got the fish and chips. Really, nothing to write home about. My boyfriend got the roasted red pepper soup special (amazing!!!), and scallops (okay).
