I've been going to the Art of Pizza for years, since way back in the day when they only occupied one store front at Ashland and Nelson. Now they occupy three. And they deserve the success. As far as pizza in Chicago goes, this is probably the best. A slice of pizza is very reasonably priced at $2.75 a piece. The staff is friendly and the line always moves quickly. Occasionally, I've had to wait five minutes or so while they pull a fresh pizza out of the oven, but this has always been worth it. Make sure to sample their deep dish selections--stuffed spinach and mushroom particularly is a sure winner.
