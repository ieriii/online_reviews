I'm glad I went here with someone who knew about the place, as I almost walked by the front door! It's somewhat hidden, but suppose to be. We walked in to a very intimate and fancy lounge. Loved the setup with high chairs and what seemed like a private little area, even though you're surrounded by others. Large drink menu, and a few food items. Had plenty of seasonal drinks, which was nice. I wouldn't become a regular here, but it was a fun place to try for a change.
