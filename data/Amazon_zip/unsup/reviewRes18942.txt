Went here in April, just posting now. Loved it! The french burger was so good. Our service was the best - literally, I would have hired this woman to work for me if we were in the same industry. DJ was awesome and really made the scene (low key, good jams) on a Thursday night. Have been wanting to go back and that is what reminded me to post.
