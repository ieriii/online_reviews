I like this place - excellent food, friendly & attentive service, pleasant setting. It is a bit on the expensive side, so it is more of a special occasion type of outing for me. Easier to get a table when it is nice enough outside for the extra "al fresco" seating, and I have felt somewhat crowded when seated inside. The chef is present and paying attention, which I regard as a good thing, and the gracious wait staff is knowledgeable about the menu and wines. Salads are generous (maybe even a bit too large) with good homemade dressings. If you like veal you can't go wrong ordering it here, they have delicious lasagna, and they know how to treat fish, all this topped off with exceptional desserts. Sapori is not cheap, but it is a cut above your typical Italian kitchen, and well worth repeated visits.
