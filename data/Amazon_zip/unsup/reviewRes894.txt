Best hot dog I've ever eaten. I had the duck with foie and the Chicago dog. Both excellent. The duck fat fries were amazing. My wife had the Santa Fe chicken, I tried that as well. So good. We went to frank and dawgs a Few days later and it doesn't compare. Can't wait to go back to Chicago and eat there again.
