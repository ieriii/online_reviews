LOVED! Wagyu Beef Stroganoff - I'm not a meat eater, but this dish made me actually enjoy meat. Loved the sauces. Pumpernickel Crusted Sturgeon - Perfect. Do not leave this place without trying it. Chocolate Torte - Dense chocolate flavor, and nice texture. EHHH... Glazed Pork Belly - The pork was tough, and hard to cut into. The pork on its own tasted mediocre, but combine it with the butternut squash and greens...YUM! Arctic Char Fillet - The fillet was nicely cooked, but it wasn't as flavorful as the rest of the dishes. Although the cider bubbles really pulled this dish together, it was sloppily doused on the plate. Blood Orange Dreamsicle - Fun yummy desert for orange lovers. I'm just bothered by the way it jiggles... HATE. Deconstructed Italian Beef - I normally like beef tartare, but I wasn't feeling this one. I guess it was the whole deconstructed deal (I'm kind of a lazy eater). **I wouldn't call this top notch fine dining, but it was a nice experience. You just have to stick to the right signature dishes.**
