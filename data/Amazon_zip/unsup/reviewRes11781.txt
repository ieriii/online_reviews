Went to Bongo Room for lunch and thought it was pretty good, but nothing outstanding. Their tuna sandwich was slightly above average (and didn't have celery, woohoo), was very generous in size, and came with some decent potato salad. The service was so-so and they seemed to be somewhat understaffed. I had heard all of the hype and was actually kind of surprised after my visit, nothing really stood out. Next time I'll have to go for brunch...
