Checked out this place with my wife after hearing about it from a friends for awhile. I'd have to say we were very pleased we did. Good place overall for a date and/or friends. Overall decor is a modern, lounge feel, but nothing too crazy. We got there around 7:30PM on a Friday night without a reservation and were able to get seated without a wait, but I think we got one of the last open tables. The place was packed for the rest of the entire meal we were there for. The menu is HUGE. There's a japanese section with probably 4 pages of maki rolls. They have other hot dishes, sashimi, appetizers and other stuff too. The Thai section was another 4 pages too, so finding something that you want to eat should be no problem. We ended up ordering the following: Philly Roll - pretty standard, got what we expected, no complaints White Dragon Roll - tasted good, fell apart a bit, but I'm easy to please as long as it tastes good Tempura roll - also good, its a bigger roll than the philly rolls (thicker) Santana roll - really big, pretty unique combination of ingredients that i really liked Also ordered - Tom Yum soup which was excellent, Bkk Street Scallops, which were awesome (maybe my favorite dish). Its 2 HUGE bacon wrapped scallops cooked perfectly with a nice sweet and spicy sauce served on top of a salad with a sesame-ginger dressing. The greens were fresh. Just a good dish all around. Overall, we were really happy we came. Presentation of food was nice on everything, but I need to come back and try their Thai curries and other rolls. There's so many kinds.......but I'll take more choices than not enough any time. Def check it out. It's easily better than any sushi option in Evanston.
