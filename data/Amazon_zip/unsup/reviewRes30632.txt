The only thing that would make this a "5" for me is when I have an opportunity to sit and enjoy a full experience. I went late during the week with a small group and we intentionally sat near the piano and ordered appetizers only. Loved the atmosphere, the service, the food, the entertainment. Pricy and worth it.
