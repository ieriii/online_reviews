What a delightful little place. Nice little atmosphere, warm service, hearty but healthy meals. Each crepe (I like the make-your-own option) comes with a soup of pureed sweet potato, and fresh fruit. It's very filling and affordable. Get yer crepes here. Get crepe'd!! Sorry, now I'm just writing words to write words.
