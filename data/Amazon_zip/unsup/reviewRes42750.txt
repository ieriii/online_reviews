Yum Yum Yum. I was craving mashed potatoes so I grub hubbed "mashed potatoes" - they were delicious. I got a whole chicken dinner which comes with two sides (i got the mashed potatoes and corn) and a pita all for like 13 bucks. It provided me with 3+ meals :-) I can't comment on the pizza because I haven't had it but I will try it eventually! I recommend this place for sure.
