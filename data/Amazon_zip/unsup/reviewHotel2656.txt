Stayed over Memorial weekend of 2011 for 4 nights and had an amazing experience! First off, the hotel is gorgeous! Loved loved loved the feeling, the design and the BEDDING! Sometimes I didn't want to leave the bed! The location was also perfect. It was so central to everything, we were able to walk everywhere with ease. Thanks to the other Yelp reviews for making sure we booked at the James. The cleaning staff was amazing. After a long day of touristy stuff with my partner we'd always come back to a clean room! The room was the perfect size for two people and we even had a gorgeous view! The staff was always accommodating, setting us up on tours, recommending which place to go and always hailing a cab for us! The rate of the hotel was actually pretty decent. Plus, FREE WiFi! Loved the James Hotel and will most definitely be back!
