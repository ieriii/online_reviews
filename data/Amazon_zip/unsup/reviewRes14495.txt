We came here to celebrate a birthday with a group of 9. The staff was very attentive and took very good care of us. Everyone loved the food, I mean EVERYONE! The selection of fish was great, the crab cakes were wonderful. They also had a clam chowder that was very good. I had the potato-encrusted white fish which good. A little rich for my taste but still very good. We will definitely be back! I also heard they have a wonderful breakfast!
