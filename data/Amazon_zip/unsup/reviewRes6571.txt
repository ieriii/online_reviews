I haven't been this impressed with a restaurant in long time. I celebrated a friend's birthday dinner here with 8 friends. We ordered and passed around several dishes including the Linguini with Sea Urchin and Crab, The risotto, rigatoni, and the halibut. We even ordered a pizza, and that was fantastic. One of my favorites was our appetizer....the "Focaccid di Recco", which was basically a semi-sweet cheese sandwiched between a crispy crust. I would go back, just for that! The reds wines we had were delicious too. And all in all, the value was good and our waitress was great.  I just simply loved it.
