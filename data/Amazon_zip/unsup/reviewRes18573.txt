Had dinner there again on Saturday. I would say that they are very friendly, and we had a large group with kids. The beer selection is great and menu is also very good. My only complaint is if you are going to put your establishment out there as a place for burgers and you ask how you want that prepared....make sure you hit it right. I asked for medium rare and it was way overcooked....second time that has happened. Just saying...the burger did taste great and I will be back.
