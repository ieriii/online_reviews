We took a bunch of people here for a work outing, so we had a set menu, 5 dishes, but I'll share our experience. we had some real good salads - they both had bacon in them, not my thing, but i was able to get around them and enjoy both the iceberg and spinach salads. the bread was very good :-) i had the salmon, which was very good.. it was served on a plank of wood, a very nice touch! the others mostly had steak or the pasta, and everyone left quite pleased! the desserts were great, as were the coffees. we had a peanut butter pie and some sort of cheesecake maybe key lime - both were big hits! they have a nice bar too, where we enjoyed an after dinner beer.. nothing wrong with that! if you're an out of towner, get a ping of the goose island "honkers" ale on tap - it's great!
