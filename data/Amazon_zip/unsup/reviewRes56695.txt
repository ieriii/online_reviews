This place was fantastic. The owner runs the show in there and he bends over backwards to make all his customers happy. We didn't have a reservation, but he found a way to fit us in even though the place was packed. The food was delicious- we had the pumpkin ravioli and spaghetti and meatballs, and tira mi su for dessert. The wait staff was very attentive.The food was excellent, but the most remarkable thing about this restaurant was how well it was run. I didn't see a table sit empty for more than five minutes, but we didn't feel rushed in the slightest. The owner was going from table to table and was totally in tune with what was going on with all of his customers. This guy should teach a class at Northwestern or something- it really was impressive.
