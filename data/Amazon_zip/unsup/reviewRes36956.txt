First try and absolutely no complaints! We wanted a relaxing night "in" and decided on delivery....yes, we were being lazy as it is a neighborhood joint, but we all deserve those days!! They are listed on grubhub with the online ordering option (thumbs up!), which allows you to peruse all options without ordering difficulty and request adjustments without the order-taker messing it up. We tried the crab rangoon, egg rolls, basil chicken, and beef fried rice from the Thai menu. The appetizer portions were small, though perfect to get a taste of what you want and not get overstuffed with the entree portions (e.g. crab rangoon has four small "purses" and the egg rolls had four small egg rolls). The food was light and flavorful. Of course, we shared our entrees....unlike most of our attempts in which we try each others and then continue eating our own entrees, we definitely split both entrees as they were delicious! We will be back for more...
