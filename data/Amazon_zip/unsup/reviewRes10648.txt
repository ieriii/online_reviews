My lovely chi town friend brought me here! The atmosphere is loud and the music is awesome. I had the tomatillo scramble, which is avocado, tomatillo, eggwhites and spinach! It was sooooo delicious! The tomatillo salsa was sweet with a hint of spicy. Even the english muffin was light and unluke the crap you buy in a supermarket. I also had a pretty nice latte to accompany it. A go to for sure!
