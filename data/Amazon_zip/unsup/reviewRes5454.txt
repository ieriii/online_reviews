One hour wait on a Tuesday night. But we stayed since we really wanted to try it. I don't mind communal tables, but the animated talker next to me elbowed me the entire night. I asked him to move over, no dice. I spilled my wine on the 21st hit, got kind of mad. Whatever. The food: it's fine. Nothing is bad. It's just not incredible. If you're looking for this type of pork palace, you'll get a much better experience and value at Mado or Publican. The mortadella was just a paste spread on very chunky bread. I tasted more bread than I did meat. Same with the bone marrow -- way too big chunky bread. The most disappointing dish was the panini nutella dessert, which was simply toasted bread with nutella inside. Really? I could make that at home for like $.50 a serving. Pork shoulder was cooked well, but served on top of bland mashed potatoes. I did like the cucumber ribbon salad that came with the quail. There wasn't much meat to the quail though. Prawns ok, octopus ok. Nothing great. Our waitress was super charming though (if a bit pushy).
