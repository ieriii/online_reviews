Wicker Park--one of my favorite neighborhoods in Chicago. Definitely enjoyed my breakfast here. Firstly, they had intelligentsia coffee!! Really delicious, and they refilled it plentifully. :) We wanted to try a few of their pancakes, but didnt want to over stuff ourselves. the server kindly let us know that instead of getting all 3 pancakes like the menu states (arond $10), we can just pay a few bucks for 1 pancake of each flavor/kind. So we ordered 2 different kinds, and even got an omelet. (definitely suggest doing this, since their pancakes, though delicious, are quite heavy, and I dont know what we would have done if we got 3 of each) We got one pancake that was white chocolate cream cheese with berries, and another with cream and caramel. The pancake itself was very fluffy and thick, and the cream was suprisingly not overbearingly sweet. But very heavy, so I had a small slice of each and was happy. You can choose 3 toppings for your omelet (we got spinach, mushroom, and chicken sausage). The omelet was good, but it was more like veggies wrapped in a sheet of egg.  The interior was clean, spacious, had bricks and a forest green wallpaper. Very pretty and trendy. Service was excellent.
