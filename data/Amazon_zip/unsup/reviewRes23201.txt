Best Chinese food you'll find in Chicago, maybe even this side of the pond. They primarily do Szechuan style so take the pepper ratings serious if your sensitive to spiciness. I recommend the Chef's Special Dry Chilli Chicken if you can take the heat. Service is very hit or miss but the food more than makes up for it. You can get in and out in a timely manner or sit around for an eternity.
