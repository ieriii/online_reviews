Taste, taste and more taste! Went with my wife for an Anniversary dinner and ever so glad we did. The food was incredible and we didn't have to wait a minute even though we walked up at 8pm on a Friday night (got to sit at the bar in front of the kitchen which was more enjoyable anyway). The tequila selection here is worth the trip alone. I got a flight and was happy with all the selections presented. Some of the best Mexican I've ever had though I can't comment on authenticity.  Great service too - will definitely be back!
