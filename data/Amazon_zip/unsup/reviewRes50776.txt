I'm one of those Chicago transplants--born in New Orleans then moved up north. With that said, I love this place. The gumbo is an absolute must. The only I prefer is my grandfathers.  Go during brunch-ish hours so you're sure to get complimentary beignets--which are delicious. I normally wouldn't order burger at a genre specific restaurant like this, as burgers can be found everywhere, but the ones here are incredible. Huge. Great bun. Great cheese and toppings. Then there is the garlic aioli. I hate mayo, but I cannot get enough of the garlic aioli. It's made fresh, and puts everything over the top. Thank god they over-slather the burger in it, so fries can pick up the drippings. They also have a great bar with a very knowledgeable staff for after hours entertainment.
