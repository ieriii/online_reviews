This is my fave place for any time drink in the neighborhood. I love the atmosphere especially around the fireplace, so comfy - 5/5. I am not a fan of the food served there, but people around me like it. Just not me - that's why I rated overall 4. The only thing I ever liked there was the seafood, but this is just personal taste. Can't wait for drinks there - coming soon:)
