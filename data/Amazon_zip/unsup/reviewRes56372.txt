Simply It is one of my favorite restaurants in Chicago. Located in the heart of Lincoln Park, it has wonderfully delicious, authentic Vietnamese food. My favorite dishes are the summer rolls and the beef pho, but everything is made with the freshest ingredients and tastes amazing. The servers are all very nice and helpful if you have any questions about the menu or need any recommendations. The restaurant is BYOB and the prices are very reasonable. I have gone to the restaurant by myself, on a date, and with large groups of people - and the restaurant is accommodating to tables of any size. Everyone that I take always leaves happy, full, and excited to go back for seconds!
