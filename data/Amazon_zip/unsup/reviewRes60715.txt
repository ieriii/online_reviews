I took a friend here yesterday and really enjoyed it. The beer selection was good, though my 312 was a bit warm but the second one was a normal temp. I had the steak and my friend had the salmon, my steak was well cooked perfectly seasoned, I didn't care for the spinach however but that was a personal preference. The wait staff was extremely attentive and always had a smile, great place!
