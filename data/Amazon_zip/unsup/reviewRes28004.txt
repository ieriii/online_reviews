This was one of the first pizza places that I came to when I moved to Chicago. I was on my search for "the best Chicago style pizza." I have to admit, I realized that I really don't like the deep dish Chicago style but Pequod's is different. It is a deep pan pizza with a caramelized/burnt crust which is something to crave. So it is really much better than traditional Chicago style, but just as filling. I can only finish one slice here and then i get sleepy. But if you haven't tried this place- you should. You can order it and pick it up or go in to a dive-type atmosphere.
