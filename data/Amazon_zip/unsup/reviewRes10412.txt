I'm a true Chicagoan so I know what I am talking about when it comes to pizza...this place is AMAZING! I love how you can go wild with your pizza toppings and it always comes out more than delicious. I could eat 5 slices if it wasn't so close to bikini season! I highly recommend the white pizza with mushrooms, spinach, and giardiniera yum yum YUMMY! thats my fav and I've had a couple of different combos. Lastly I would love to give high praises to rocket...He always answers the phone when I place a carry out or delivery order. He is so nice and fun on the phone I sort of want to call back and order more pizza. He has great customer service skills and when i make my combos on the pizza he always has other ideas for next time. Every business needs a rocket! He rocks :) All in all the pizza is amazing, great price and the beers are really great too, so nice and relaxing with a group of friends open doors pizza and beer...does Chicago get any better?
