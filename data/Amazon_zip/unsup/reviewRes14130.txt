This was the second time I'd been to Revolution. Both times on a Sunday afternoon. It's true that you will have to wait if you go during peak times. And peak times for this place include Wednesday evenings. So that's why I couldn't give the place 5 stars. But I guess my point is, it's busy for a reason. I've had a variety of items from the menu. From the cheddar soup, to the beet and feta salad, sausage plate, and pulled pork. Everything I've tasted has been delicious. As a former Virginian, I'm quite impressed by the pork BBQ. Not too saucy, slightly tangy, and extremely tender. As a pulled pork lover, I'd say this was some of the best I've had in the city. And the beer, yum! So excited to have a quality microbrew in my neighborhood. They also have a wide variety of bottled beer. As far as the service goes, I haven't had a problem. I went with my parents and aunt and uncle who were visiting for the weekend and we all thought the service was great. I was a bit nervous about bringing older people there in fear that it would be too noisy, but they gave us a booth upstairs, which worked out great. Enjoy!
