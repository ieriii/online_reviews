Went for dinner on a Friday night and found it to be highly over rated. I've heard raving reviews but not sure why. The food was ok, but used fancy descriptions to make it sound better than it tastes. I tried the pork belly and it was all fat. It was more like glorified carnitas at 10x the price. My wife ordered the pasta and found it very pedestrian.
