Great find for northsiders. The number of menu options and specials are a little overwhelming. My wife had a special homemade gnocchi stuffed with asiago pesto, and in a creamy red sauce. This might have been the single best item of food I've ever placed in my mouth.  My entree was a large elbow pasta (also homemade) with creamy meat sauce, and chicken Parmesan on top. I think we'll probably have 3 more meals with the leftovers, because we also had garlic bread and salad, but that's fine by mee! Oh yea- service was good, and there was no wait at 7:30 on Thursday night. This will be a neighborhood favorite for a long time.
