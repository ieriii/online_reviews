I've been to New Haven and have had apizzas but I did not think Piece was anything special. The crust was good, but the sauce did not have much of a tomato taste and the garlic did not come through. We had spinach and bacon on ours, which helped with the flavors but nothing from the sauce or crust.  The server was good and staff was pretty accommodating due to the short wait. I was surprised at the number of people who had brought young children or babies for a bar environment. Strollers were blocking paths and babies were being held at various locations. Since the area is pretty busy, parking can be difficult.
