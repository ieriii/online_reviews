The Purple Pig is, in no small measure, one of my favorite places on Earth. The cooking is right in my wheelhouse - approachable, yet by no means pedestrian, and full of flavor. The atmosphere is boisterous and lively, especially if you sit at the "chef's bar" right next to the pass. Can't wait to visit the fair Windy City again. Be worth the 3-hour flight just to have another go at their 'smears' menu.....!
