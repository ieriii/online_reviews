My boyfriend and his family hyped this place up, and for once, I was not disappointed in something that everyone raves about. From the minute you see the place from the outside, it's inviting and colorful. I liked the casual and homey feel on the inside. Even though there was a line to be seated, everything went pretty speedy and the restaurant apparently has two large rooms. Before getting our entrees, they brought out a small complimentary special to everyone at the table. That was a huge plus, and it really gives you a nice preview of what's to come. I had chicken enchiladas with red sauce, and it was amazing, though very rich (to be expected). I tried the pork fajitas too, and they were delicious as well. Overall, I would definitely go back. It was great not just for the food, but for the dining experience.
