This place is amazing. My fiance and I go as often and as early as we can to beat the rush which usually starts by 5 pm. We love the pizza. It's great the next day. The farro salad is soooo yummy. The boards with ragu of the day is to die for. The davanti burger was so different and so fantastic. The ambiance is great, friendly wait staff. I can't rave enough about it. So good!!!!
