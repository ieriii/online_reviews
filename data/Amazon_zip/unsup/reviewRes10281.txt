This. Place. Rocks. Seriously!!! The atmosphere is awesome, the food delish, the service wonderful, friendly and very knowledgeable!!! I cannot believe I have not discovered this place sooner....especially because it has the most gorgeous outdoor patio area I have seen in a long time. I can't wait to go back next spring when it gets warm out again! Valet parking was only $6. So cheap! We had a group of 10....so it was tough for out server I'm sure.....but he did a great job! Thanks Anthony! Go here. Soon...you won't be disappointed!!
