Went here for a birthday dinner in late June. Aside from the truffle popcorn we were dissapointed overall by our experience. There were 8 of us and it was our first time to Chicago so we wanted to give some attention to a locally known chef. Menu lived up to Elliot's notable creativity, but flavor for many dishes fell flat including the split pea soup was a nice presenation but lacked in flavor and was almost cold. The biggest dissapointment was our service. We were brought more appetizers than we ordered, and even after sending them back we were still charged for them.  It took about a half an hour to resolve our bill which included two bills from the waiter who got it wrong both times. Finally the manager was able to help us out. Our waiter was snobby throughout our dining experience, he continusouly brushed us off as if he had more important patrons to tend to. If you want a top notch dining experience in Chicago I advise that you skip Graham Elliott's overated self titled establishment.
