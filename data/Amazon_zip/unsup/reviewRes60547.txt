I'm a huge fan of both Grand Luxe and Cheesecake Factory, but at Grand Luxe you never get sat "cafeteria style". You know, elbow to elbow with the strangers at the table next to you??? Anyhow, owned by the same folks, but Grand Luxe always seems to have a smidge more flavorful product which is weird. My TOP PICKS......the pineapple martini...OMG YUM!!!!!! The Chicken Picatta with extra capers and then to finish it off...the whit chocolate rasberry cheesecake. FABULOUS!!!!! Never had a bad meal or service there!!!
