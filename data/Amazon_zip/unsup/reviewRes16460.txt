This was my first time at Carnivale and I loved it!!!! I'm not really sure why we had never been there before, but we will definitely be back. We went with a larger group on Saturday night and were seated pretty much within 10 minutes of our reservation. Most people had the sangria and they all agreed it was really good! I stuck with my usual white wine ;) We ordered a few appetizers to begin with and they were ALL phenomenal! I think the plantains were my favorite though. The flavors were just soooo out of this world. We also had the fish tacos, the shrimp ceviche and some kind of cheese concoction. Everyone at the table enjoyed everything! For the main course I ordered the Atun - Seared Tuna, which was honestly to die for. It was so buttery and flavorful and it came on a bed of spicy fufu (idk? it was delicious)! I ate my ENTIRE plate. I never do that. My boyfriend had the braised short ribs, and he definitely liked mine much better. He said it was lacking in the taste department and kinda dry. One of our friends at the end of the meal commented and that it was probably one of the most flavorful meals he had ever had, and I think that pretty much sums up Carnivale. Delicious!!!!
