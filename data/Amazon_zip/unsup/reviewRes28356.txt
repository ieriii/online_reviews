My favorite place for pizza in Chicago! Go with the thick! They place some cheese between the crust and the pan so that it caramelizes. MMM MMM good. Also the Italian sausage has a little kick to it. You have to get the pizza and eat it there...i once ordered it for delivery and the crust was separating from the rest of the pizza....and it wasn't has great as I've had it at the restaurant. The wait staff is cool. The best deal is the $5 lunch special where you get a pint of beer and a mini deep dish pizza.
