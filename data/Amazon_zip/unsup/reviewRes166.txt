I know, I know, this review is very late. My husband and I decided to celebrate our wedding half-anersary here and I must say, it was a really really good experience. Everything was en pointe and nothing beats having grant achatz plate the whole table with our dessert! here's our video: http://www.youtube.com/u and here's photos of everything we ate. http://www.flickr.com/ph a word from the wise: grant achatz loves truffles, and a lot of what we ate had truffles in them - and if you dont like the earthy, vomit inducing flavor - tell them. we were "suffering" through all the trufflecentric dishes. GO!
