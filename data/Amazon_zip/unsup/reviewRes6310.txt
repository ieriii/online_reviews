I love this place since I suffer from phantom nostelgia and the wood paneling and old fashioned service makes me feel like I'm in a supper club during the 1940's. The steak is tasty, though nothing super special, and the potatoes rock. What also rocks are the martinis- at least according to my fiance. He always asks for extra blue cheese olives and the bartender never fails to honor his request. Yay for good service.
