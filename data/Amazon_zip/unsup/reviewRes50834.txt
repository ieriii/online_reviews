I really wish I liked this place. It's a stone's throw from my house and they have patio seating on a quiet little strip of School just off Lincoln. The first time I was here, we ordered brunch. I got crab cakes and others got more familiar brunch fair. No one was very impressed with their food and my crab cakes tasted like they were microwaved. The biggest problem I had with it was that to be in there on a Saturday afternoon for brunch was comparable to the atmosphere at the Field Museum's cafeteria. Full of little kids, loud and echo-y, and not very well lit. Just not a fun time. So I went back fairly recently to grab a quick bloody mary. I sat outside, had to wait about 10 minutes for service, and after all that, the bloody mary tasted like red water with an olive and celery in it. Come on, really? If Reggie's Rock Club can make one of the better bloody's I've had in Chicago, why can't a place that supposedly uses such fresh ingredients go to Foremost and buy some Ditka's Bloody Mary Mix? I was never checked on and had to ask for the check inside. $6.50 later, I stepped out the door, determined never to go back.
