I was looking forward to eating at Xoco for the longest time, but I gotta admit that it did not live up to my expectations. I tried the Ahogado and I thought it was a little on the saltier side. I also had the churros with the chocolate dip, and it was really sweet. Overall it was an okay experience. Maybe it was because it was towards the end of the night? I don't know. I think i'll have to go back and try it again. Hopefully it will change my mind!
