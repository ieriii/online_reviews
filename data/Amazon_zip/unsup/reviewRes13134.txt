Glenn's was recommended to us forever ago as a great place to go during Lent since they've got great fish. Well Lent ended a while ago, but we finally had an excuse to be in Glenn's 'hood, so we gave it a whirl. Verdict: why oh why did we wait so long to get up here! Lent or not, Glenn's is awesome. It is, in fact, mostly seafood, but instead of doing seafood in a fancy, haughty way, they just make it taste awesome. It really feels like a diner, but an uber popular one. Without reservations on a Wednesday evening we were relegated to the bar. But with the super friendly, honest and helpful bartenders, it was hardly a set back. Don't be intimidated by the huge menu they give you. Toss it aside and focus on the chalkboards on the wall - that's where the good stuff is. Fish of every make and model, in a huge variety of preparations, plus apps and desserts that looked amazing. We went with the shrimp in butter and cheese and goodness for an appetizer, then the jambalaya and the arctic char for dinner. All SO good. Seriously, pretend Montrose and Damen is a convenient location and get your butt up there ASAP!
