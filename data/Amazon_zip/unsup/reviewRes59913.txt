Conveniently located across the street from my favorite gym, Wicker Park Fitness, I can grab a great cup of coffee before I go make myself bohemieth. Just kidding, I'm more into toning. Just be careful because all the great cakes that you see in the window can be dangerous to the gut but well worth it.
