Great and unique Chicken wings in a very surprising restaurant. If I was walking by Crisp I wouldn't pay it much attention and most likely wouldn't go in. After reading other yelpers reviews of Crisp I decided to go and try it out. I have only been once but my experience was very good and the staff was extremely friendly at all times. I tried the Seoul Sassy wings and the Crisp BBQ wings and they were both very good but I preferred the Seoul Sassy. For the amount and quality of the wings, I happily paid $8 for the wings. Great wings restaurant and everything thing is cooked to order so you will wait at least 10 minutes for your order. A gem of a fast food restaurant, just wish it was closer to my apartment.
