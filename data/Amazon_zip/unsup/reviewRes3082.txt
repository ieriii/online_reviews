DELICIOUS! A coworker and I picked it up for lunch and brought it back to the office. Everybody at the table was raving about it. There was enough variety of items for it to have not been a fluke. There were wings, there was some barbecue, there was a sandwich and some chicken strips. I had the sandwich with the Seoul Sassy sauce. The sandwich was huge and tender and flavorful. The vote was unanimous, we would definitely get lunch again from Crisp.
