I think this is the quintessential real-Chicago restaurant. I love everything about this place -- decor, menu, service. of course, you're in the warehouse district in Chicago, so skip an alfresco table unless you want a view of scurrying rats. Hey, its' the neighborhood. The food is crazy-good and SIMPLE. I love how the menu allows you to go from individual small plates to large plates meant for sharing. The serves are exceptionally knowledgeable about their beer menu. I had the short rib and its was seasoned subtly (I usually want very bold flavors) and it melted in my mouth. The seafood here is as good as the pork and beef. How often can you say that? The decor is perfect for people who want to just come for drinks (nestled in the center of the restaurant) to all the outlying tables for dinner. Also, the front desk is probably the best in town. I like this place so much, all my friends are getting gift certificates for their birthdays. The peeps behind this wanted a high-end but no-muss/no-fuss Chicago experience, and they delivered a knock out punch.
