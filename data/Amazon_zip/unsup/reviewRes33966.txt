Here's the thing about Sultan's: I've been eating there for years, but in the past two years it has poisoned me about 50% of the time I've gone there. Poisoned. Bad. This never happens to me - seriously iron stomach here - and I'm baffled that this place has an effect on me that street food in Africa and South America almost never did (nor have any other Middle Eastern restaurants in town). Ew.
