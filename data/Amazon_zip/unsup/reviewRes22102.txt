Irazu? Yes, I DO-razu. I was totally intrigued by the Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives connection. This was gonna be good and it was EPIC! I had the pepito sandwich with chicken. I loved how they used black beans like a spread. Words like "pretty awesome" don't even come close to describing how yummy it was. I'm drooling just thinking about it. The hubby had El Tico with chicken; really good favors all sauted together, served with a few slices of sweet plantain, side of black beans, slaw and rice. Nothing but love for that dish too. For Chicago this place has great prices.  We also split an oatmeal banana milkshake (2% milk is what they use, soy is the other option). I have to say I was a little surprised it wasn't cold, it was almost room temp. I fixed that with some ice cubes from my water. Once it got chilled down a bit, I could full enjoy what was probably one of the best milkshakes ever! I was a little skeptical about the oatmeal factor, I was expecting it to be grainy but it was so smooth and thick and utterly amazing. If I was smart I would have order my own and then another one for the road. Cash only.
