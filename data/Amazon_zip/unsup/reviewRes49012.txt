I went to the Publican for a bachelor party, and it was great. The restaurant is located in the Fulton Market (west loop) amongst all the industrial meat packing companies. You'll be overwhelmed with their beer menu, so be sure to ask the knowledgeable servers for their help. The food is outstanding, but the menu is also complicated. They recommend you order your food "family style". So you choose a variety of dishes, and pass them around sampling a little bit from each...kind of like a tapas restaurant. Everybody at my table went nuts over the pork belly, but my favorite was still the oysters....so good!
