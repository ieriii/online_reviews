What more can be said about Piece? Not much. It's good. Darn good. And when you combine good pizza with good beer, it's even better.  A note to the newbies, don't blow your wad on toppings. I know, I know, they all sound droolicious, but we're talking thin crust here. Too many toppings and you'll need three hands to hold each slice. Or you'll need to use a knife and fork. And please... that's LAME, not to mention the slices won't fit on a plate.  My only reason for docking a star is because this place is alway busy. And that's spectacular for them, but their system for letting people know that their table is ready on a jam packed Saturday night involves one host pushing through the bar crowd screaming someone's name that the table is now ready. I can't hear you. I'm drinking my Camel Toe and screaming over the crowd so that my friends can hear me tell a hilarious story. What's wrong with little buzzers, yo? Or is that too efficient for the Wicker Park scene?
