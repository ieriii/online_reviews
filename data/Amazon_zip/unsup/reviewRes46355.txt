It's definitely a tourist trap but its such a beautiful restaurant and such great food that I still love it for my downtown eating. HUGE and varied deserts, a huge menu with things like yummy lettuce wraps and great pastas. Its not surprising gourmet food but always good and a nice experience. The wait can be really long and its so busy that service can be so so but I still go back alot.
