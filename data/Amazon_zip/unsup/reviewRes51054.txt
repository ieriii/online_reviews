An update.... Paul, the owner, very graciously reached out after reading of our unfortunate experience and made a very kind offer to try and rectify the situation with assurances that the waiter situation had been....resolved. An extra star for effort. As I did mention in my review, we had a very pleasant experience the first time we were there so it seems like trying dinner with reset expectations seems likely in our future.
