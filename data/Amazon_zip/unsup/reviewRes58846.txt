Best sushi in Chicago! Everytime I dine at SUNDA the customer service blows me away, but last week in particular really blew me out of the water. I had called earlier in the afternoon around 1PM, hoping to make a reservation for two in the dining room, unfortunately the dining room was fully commited so the hostess reserved us a spot in the lounge. I know reservations are hard to come by, expecially on a Friday night, so I was ecstatic to have a seat regardless. Much to my excitment later in the evening received a phone call from Carla, one of the hostesses who informed me that she was able to find me a seat in the dining room because of a cancellation. She couldnt have been friendlier on the phone and when I arrived treated me as though I was the only one in the restraunt. Once seated we had the pleasure of having Rachel wait on us. She was very knowledgable of all the dishes, super friendly, and fun- she made our dining experience one to remember! All in all the food, ambience, and service that SUNDA provided was impeccable- I highly reccomend this restraunt and will definately be a retunring customer.
