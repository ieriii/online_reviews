Five ++++++++++++++++++++ Stars. This pizza is amazing. I go about every week to get a slice and if I miss a week I get awfully cranky. I can't speak for the deep dish or the thin but the stuffed crust is out of this world. The crust is perfect, the sauce is perfect and it has enough veggies that you can almost convince yourself that it is healthy.
