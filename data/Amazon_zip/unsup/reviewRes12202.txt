This place is amazing!!! They have a new special every 2 weeks. The Leek Soup is amazing! The Taste of Cuba appetizer is to die for with that saffron sauce, it makes my mouth water just thinking of it. For Entrees the Lamb Shank was superb and Carne a la parilla is two thumbs up too!!! The Organic Agave Nectar Margarita is sooo good, I can have like 5 of them. One last thing I also love the Papa rellena. As you can tell I have been there a lot and have Love every dish I have gotten there. So give it a shot :) The prices are very reasonable too :0
