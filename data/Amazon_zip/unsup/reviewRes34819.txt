I'm usually a burger / hot dog guy, but the Falafel sandwiches here are something that I actually crave on a regular basis. Other recommendations are the kefta kabob, and stuffed grape leaves at the bar. Prices are going up. Sometimes the quality of the food isn't as great when it's been sitting around a bit longer (this is rare). They only take cash (but there is an ATM across from the entrance. One time I ordered delivery and the soup was spilled all over everything else in the bag. It's a very quick walk from the damen blue line stop, but you might have to wade through a pack of hipsters smoking outside of estelle's / subterranean.
