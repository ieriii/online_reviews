This place was a total disappointment! Went to celebrate my bday there last night. And unfortunately I forgot the birthday card my husband had given me with a gift card in there. When I called to inquire about it, I was told that they didn't have it. I spoke to the General Manager, Joe Taylor and his demeanor was very dispicable to say the least. He claimed that they never keep such things and would have no way of returning them anyway. He showed absolutely no sympathy and added that he does not believe any restaurant would keep it and hold it for the customer in case they called. I understand it's hard to get something back like that, but he was an insensitive jerk, that it just turned me off completely....it's not like I was dining out at a fast food joint. It's all about customer service. When I told him I was disappointed with his response and that I would write about it, he said, "Go ahead, my name is Joe Taylor...." He did not care about loosing business. To top it off, the food wasn't even worth the price. Eat a much better qulaity meal at Ruth's Chris, the staff there have manners.
