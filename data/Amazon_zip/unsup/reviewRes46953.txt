Went here a few weeks ago. The atmosphere was nice, but I wasn't all that impressed with the live music on a Sunday afternoon. I never thought I'd have to yell during brunch-time to be heard across a table.  Otherwise, the food was good, but not overly impressive, especially at the price. The service was good for the crowd, and we were seated fairly quickly. Oh, and even though there's a parking lot, there's still easy street parking.
