I wish my stomach was bigger! What can you say that hasn't already been said? Valet is middle of the pack price wise, but when you roll yourself out the door after dinner, you'll understand why they get away with $12 (Walking WILL be very, very hard). The salad bar is freaking awesome. I love the different cheeses, chicken salad, and apple salad. The polenta, plantains, and garlic mashed potatoes are delectable. My favorite main course has to be the Parmesan pork. Unreal. This was our fourth visit, and Fogo has always been amazing. Definitely bring your wallet - it's expensive, but make sure your appetite is right behind it. You will not go home hungry after Fogo de Chao. We love this place!
