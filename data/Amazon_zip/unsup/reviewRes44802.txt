So far this is my favorite Chicago style pizza(better Gino's East, and def better than Lou Malnatis) I know i need to try a lot more. Anyways i'd prob only give it a 3.5 but I feel fine with 4 stars. I've never had great service at any Girodano's but average at best with it coming close to bad. The pizza is consistently good no matter how you order it or what toppings you get. The apps are consistently average, think frozen and flash fried.
