Okay you're probably thinking Why 3 stars? First time here and we didn't realized the area that looks like bar seating is the waiting area. The bartender never told us we can't sit and eat there so we had to move to the bar in which they only had about 8 seats. We were lucky to be able to sit. So we ordered the small pizza and it was HUGE! I wish the bartender told us to order the individual size but he didn't. He wasn't really helpful with us at all. Anyhow I felt the pizza was okay. There was nothing that stood out about our deep dish. We got the one with everything in it, sausage, mushrooms, and other veggies. So overall do I feel this place is overrated? DEFINITELY!
