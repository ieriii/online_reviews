If you're looking for a place to have a hearty breakfast, look no further--Yolk is your place.  When you first look at the menu, it may be a bit overwhelming, as they have so many delicious items to choose. However, I'm more of an omelet person, so I have tried almost all of their omelet dishes and they are quite tasty. My boyfriend usually gets their skillet dish; which to my amazement, he manages to eat it all. FYI - The portions here are pretty generous. If you do plan to visit this place, expect to wait between 20- 25 minutes on weekends. I usually wait outside and sit along the flower beds. They have an outdoor intercom so you can hear when they call your name. Some opted to wait inside; however, it's just a big open space for people to stand. As one reviewer previously noted, wish they utilized the open space---they can easily put 4-5 additional tables there, or provide seats if they plan to use it as a waiting area.  The ambiance is modern, vibrant, and airy. The service is prompt. The location is excellent---just minutes away from the Millennium Park.  Enjoy!
