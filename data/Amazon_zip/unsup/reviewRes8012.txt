This experience can only be summed up as such: An Epic Journey of Meat. Now don't get me wrong, I love a good salad, and their salad bar is amazing! Crazy cheeses and tons of different kinds of lettuce and spinach and all sorts of sprouts and just... if you can think of it, they probably have it. But the meat! O, the meat! Guys walk around in little pirate pants, (ok so they're supposed to be Brazilian gachos or something, but they look like pirates). And they walk around with meat, hunks of meat on swords, and all different kinds of meat! Chicken and sausage and lamb and pork and loins and roasts and fillet mignon that's like butter.  Expensive? Sure, but I think I can eat $60 worth of meat. And desert? Strawberry creme with blackberry liquor... gelato, dulce de leche...  Just try it.
