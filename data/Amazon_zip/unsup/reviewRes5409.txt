I would definitely recommend this place. Great wine selection, ambiance, delicious and flavorful fare. The wait staff was helpful and provided suggestions based on our preferences. Purple Pig is also reasonably priced for the quality of food. We waited about twenty-five minutes for a table but sat outside on the benches and ordered a glass of wine. We were seated at a communal table and meet some awesome people from Southern California and Ohio. It's a great weekend or week night option if you are looking for great wine, delicious and flavorful food, and a chill environment that's not too loud. I loved the whipped Feta with cucumbers, and the Panini.
