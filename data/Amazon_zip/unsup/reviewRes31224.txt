After reading over the reviews for this place, it seems that most of the reviewers who gave it a one-star rating are neither vegan nor vegetarian...and some have even prefaced their review by stating that they don't like vegan food.  For the love of Satan...If you don't like vegan food, don't effin' eat here! Your review is a waste of time for those of us out there who LIKE veg food, and are willing to try new dishes sans meat. I've followed a vegetarian diet for twenty years - most of the time, vegan. I vacillate back and forth between the two, and really don't care about anyone's preachiness. Chicago Diner doesn't seem to have that kind of a vibe, so I don't really understand the comments that attribute preachiness as a characteristic you'll find there. Quite simply, the food just really isn't that great. I have eaten there probably a dozen times over the last ten years. Nothing has ever "WOWED!" me. On the other hand, nothing I have had there has been gross or terrible or disgusting or...you get the point. It just kind of IS... ...as such, I won't go out of my way to eat there. If a friend from out of town wants to eat there, I'll take them. I won't suggest it, but I'll happily go along.
