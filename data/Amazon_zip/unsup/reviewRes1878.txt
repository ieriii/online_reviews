We waited for almost 2 hours but I don't regret it. Hot Doug's has a great variety of dogs and it's a great atmosphere. Since this will likely be the only time we are at Hot Dougs, we ended up ordering 4 different dogs plus an order of cheese fries and an order of duck fat fries. All of the dogs were good and we appreciated Doug taking the time to make recommendations on toppings etc - he's very nice also. The fries were great but I honestly couldn't taste the difference between the regular and duck fries. After trying their competitor's hot dogs, I can say confidently that Hot Doug's has the best dogs in Chicago.
