The portions are giant but the food is fantastic. I live in the neighborhood and it's a fantastic default. I have never had to wait for a table and the service is very good. Brunch is great but don't try it too early cuz' they aren't open until late morning. The menu is huge so even the pickiest eater will be pleased. I would recommend the crab and asparagus omellete and anything on the appetizer menu. Enjoy!
