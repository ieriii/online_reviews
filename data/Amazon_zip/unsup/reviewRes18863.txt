A friend told me I HAD to come here upon my arrival in Chicago. So, I went for dinner on Monday and it was delightful. So, I went back for lunch on Tuesday. Oh, yeah, it's that good. And somehow, even though it's kind of swanky, I find it charming, affordable and delicious. TIPS: Ask for their soup of the day! I've had it three times now, and each time it's innovative and delicious (i.e. venison chili,pureed cauliflower with crab, etc.) Also, be sure to inquire about their sandwich of the day at lunch time---I once heard of a porkbelly with soft shell crab....yep, that's real. If you're into mushrooms, try the wild mushroom sandwich...soo good. For Dessert, try a sampler of their sorbet--recently, they had whiskey sorbet and it rocked my world. The only thing here that I warn everyone against are the chicken livers. They just need to take it off the menu. Really.  Overall, The Gage is why I look for any reason to visit Chicago (it's not really hard); the service is excellent, the food delicious and intriguing, and the soap in the bathroom (I'm not kidding) is wonderful. I regularly use the restroom multiple times just so I can use it.
