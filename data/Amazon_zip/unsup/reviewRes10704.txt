Piece is a decent place to go for good thin and crispy pizza....it's a nice change from all of the deep dish Chicago pizza around (not that I don't love deep dish too!!).  It's a very comfortable place, and if you don't feel like getting all all dressed up to impress, this is a great laid back place to come and just relax and eat!!!
