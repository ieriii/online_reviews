I have my go-to churrascarias in California, and had always thought that Fogo de Chao (as a chain) would be overrated and overpriced. But one day, my buddy and I found ourselves bored, hungry, and hankering for meat in Chicago. So, we called for a reservation, got lucky with the parking (which sucks in Chicago), and prepared ourselves for insane amounts of meat at a completely unreasonable price. Lo and behold, I thought I got my money's worth. Yes, it was as expensive as I thought it would be, but the flavor of the grilled meats was the best, just absolutely top-notch. After sampling the dozen+ meats available, my declared favs were the sirloin cap (picanha) and the rib-eye (ancho). We had a particular server who asked us if we wanted anything cuts in particular (after noticing that were were starting to decline some things), and then afterwards would come to our table first when he had a freshy with him. Sure, the salad bar disappoints... but why the hell are you coming to place like this for the salad bar?? They should hang up a sign that says, "We reserve the right to refuse service to non-carnivores." So my verdict... I would go to Fogo again. The meat outweighs any shortcoming of the salad bar. Sometimes, it's nice to have misjudged. (Also, I didn't feel like you had to be particularly dressed up to go here).
