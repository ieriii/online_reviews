This place has been on my list of places to try ever since I saw Duff Goldman recommend it on 'The Best Thing I Ever Ate' Pizza Episode on the Food Network.  We got very lucky because we didn't have to wait to get in. We went in the late afternoon on a Thursday, if that helps. ;) On the episode mentioned above, Duff said to get the Sausage-Patty Style, so that is what we ordered (Medium). It consisted of golden crust, chunky tomato sauce, layers of cheese and a disk of Gino's East fresh Italian sausage. It had everything that a tasty pizza should have, except it just wasn't tasty. We had to wait 45 minutes for the pizza (all the deep dishes take 45 minutes). The crust, the sauce and even the sausage were devoid of any flavor. While this pizza looks delicious, it was mediocre at best. The atmosphere and the decor are fun. The service was decent. If I would have had to wait in line AND wait 45 minutes for the pizza, I would have been a very angry tourist. I simply don't think it would be worth the wait.  Go on a day where there is no wait and see for yourself but I personally wouldn't choose to eat here again.
