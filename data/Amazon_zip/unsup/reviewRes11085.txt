What's more to life than pizza, great microbrew and lots of tvs turned to the best sports games? Karaoke. Yes, the karaoke is the icing on the cake, or should we say the excellent toppings on the pizza at Piece? I love the white pizza which has some garlic, lots o cheese and not a tomato in site. I put some delicious healthy veggie options on top (broccoli and mushrooms please) and I'm set. The red sauce pizza is great too though and with any number of toppings to choose from you can't go wrong with these thin crust, gigantic slices. If you're looking to feed a group go for the large pizza and of course get a big old bottle of beer to go with (servers are very knowledgeable about their brews).
