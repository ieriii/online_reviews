I don't know who came up with the name, but there should be a truth in naming law for restaurants. There is nothing pub-like about the place, and certainly no publican in place.  First, there is no bar. NONE. Second, the place is sterile. I like a good wood any day, but this place looks like it deforested half of Illinois. Lights are too bright, noise level is over the top and really - $14 for a beer? Come on. If you are lucky, you'll get one of the handful of non-communal tables. Or perhaps, the claustrophobia-inducing booths with doors that you have to open to get in. What possible purpose do they serve? Otherwise, its either the communal tables or the counter.  The food may be as good as many of the Yelpers say...we wouldn't know. We were so turned off by the place we left after one drink. And won't be back.
