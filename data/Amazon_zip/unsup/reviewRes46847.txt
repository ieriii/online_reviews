I moved to Chicago a month ago and we happened upon this gem a few blocks from our home. My girlfriend and I are both big fans of slow food and craft beer served up by friendly and talkative people. This place nails it! Really awesome patio area surrounded by planter boxes of herbs and vegetables.  I would have given 5 stars but I've gone in late night on two occasions and got the waitress on the tail end of a very long double each time. As a veteran of the industry I am sympathetic to horribly long days but at the end of mine, yours just isn't my problem. P.s. The bar is beautiful
