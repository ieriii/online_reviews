Service was quick and attentive, the space was well utilised and the food was fantastic. We were the last table to clear out and they were very kind to us about it. I prefer Giordano's sauce and amount of cheese on their deep dish pizzas but Gino's East can't be beaten on their cornmeal crust. Best part of the whole pizza. Well, that and the pile of sausage they piled on...
