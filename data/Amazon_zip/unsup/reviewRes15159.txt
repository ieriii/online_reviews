LOVE this place....only had a few entrees here (Chicken Marsala, chicken parm, I think, and Paglia Feino, which is linguine alfredo+mushrooms+peas+pancetta, FAB-you-lusss), but they give you so much in portion, and with soup AND salad, and a big loaf of bread (w/oil, butter, parm), even if you're a pig like me, you're likely to have leftovers to take home. Entrees VERY reasonable (mostly $15-20ish, except for steak or seafood), service is great (I've only dined at the bar), and, it's old-school. If you're a vegetarian, hipster, or expecting nouveau, trendy or chic, yeah, probably don't bother, if that isn't obvious by just looking at the place. Duh. I'd love to eat here every day, but I'd weigh about six hundred pounds.
