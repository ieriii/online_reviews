Join their select guest program, the benefits are real and significant unlike a lot of other places. Search and work for good rates. Omni's prices are always going up and down. I get the best luck when I call the hotel directly. The website and toll free number are unyielding. Great hotel, clean rooms, excellent location, great staff -very friendly, free room service coffee every morning for select guests. Restaurant and bar are way over priced and I don't like the starbucks coffee they serve every day but I can overlook this. I love starbucks and their specialty drinks but their ordinary coffee has always tasted a bit skunky to me. Also the sliding doors for the bathrooms can't be locked. If I weren't staying alone or shared a room on a business trip this would be awful. Thanks to Chicago's crappy zoning regulations, one thing that's really a shame and will change Omni forever is the Ritz-Carlton. Ritz-Carlton is building a massive hotel just to the South of Omni. I mean there may be 6 inches if that between these hotels and the Ritz extends just a about 4 feet closer to Michigan completely ruining the South view and corner room views Omni had on Michigan. What were once top rate, top price rooms, are now the worst rooms in the hotel. What a bummer. Omni can't be happy. Still a great hotel that can be had a fair prices. Thanks to the Ritz maybe even better prices.
