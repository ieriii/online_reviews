Love the fact that you can get deep dish by the slice and that everyday they have a variety of choices (not just one special on certain days). My favorite is the deep dish spinach mushroom. It's delicious! I have found it tastes a little better when you order a whole pizza, but I make do with buying just a slice since I often just stop in while I am out and about and don't need a whole pizza. I have had it both to go and in their dining room, and both are good experiences. Dining room is pretty low key, but for a quick lunch or dinner it's perfectly fine.
