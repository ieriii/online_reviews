So far I've only been here once, but I'll definitely make a point of going back when I find myself in the neighborhood. I had a glass of the Mettler cabernet, which was lovely. One of my friends had "the spiciest bloody mary" he'd ever tasted, and the other had a Frail Baby, a coffee liqueur drink that scores points just for the name and was apparently very tasty. The shop itself feels (for lack of a better word) extremely tasteful. Recommended!
