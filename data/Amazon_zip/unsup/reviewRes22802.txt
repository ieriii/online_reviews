The food is cheap, but tasty for the price. The "hole in the wall" decor seems to be a good fit for the food. The shakes are a must. But it is popular enough for the tiny size that the wait can be brutal.  I recommend going for breakfast (love their beans and eggs options) or lunch. Or go in the summer if you must go on a weekday evening since there is additional seating out doors, and you can easily bide outside while waiting.  Still, I you would be hard pressed to find a cheaper way to try a cuisine that isn't well represented in Chicago.
