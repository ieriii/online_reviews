Gino's East's major selling point is their home based decor- they sell you marker pens and let you write whatever and wherever you want. The place is LITTERED with scribbles and doodles on every chair, every statue, every inch of wall space and window; it's crazy. I even saw writing in places that were unreachable- not sure how people managed that. The prices are ok, but the pizza is sub-par. You can clearly taste that the crust is made of mid grade cornbread. Giordano's is the other place we visited for deep dish pizza and that was WAY better.
