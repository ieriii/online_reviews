Ambience: Very dark, but I heard that's normal for steak restaurants. We sat in the bar area with the live band, which was not too bad except that it was hard to hear each other talk. Service: Pretty good. Waitress was knowledgeable and prompt, as you would expect from a restaurant of this price, so not much to say here. Misc: We made a reservation on a Monday night, so they weren't really that busy. We were about half hour late for our reservation but they were ok with that. Food: Steak was excellent. Among the 3 of us we covered the basic cuts - filet, new york strip, and ribeye. The 22 oz ribeye was very flavorful and cooked exactly how I ordered it. The steaks come out sizzling hot and juicy - they serve them on heated plates. We also got the lobster mashed potatoes as a side to share, which is also very good. Price: The steak was $50, plus $30 for the side divided among the 3 of us, for a total of about $60 per person. This price is on the low end for this restaurant. This is not really a place to visit regularly, but I had a severe craving for a good steak and it was money well-spent for me.
