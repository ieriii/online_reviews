According to Crain's Chicago Business, this half bar-half bistro is categorized as a "Gastropub," and does everything possible to distinguish itself from the bland South Michigan Ave. area it's in. We arrived 15 minutes earlier than our reservation time and were seated immediately--a first for us in Chicago restaurants. The lively atmosphere was a blend of financial district Gordon Gekko types sipping $20 Scotch, hip academia schmoozers, a smattering of office workers in from the snow. The draped but separate dining area offered a slight comfort from the rest of the bar. The Gage may be owned and managed by an Irishman, but it is culinary leaps and bounds beyond Bennigan's. The food is difficult to describe. It's eclectic: house-made sausages ($16), Amish chicken ($15), semolina and risotto soup ($19) are a few choices from a rather complex and pricey menu. Our waiter, charming Augustus, was efficient, cheerful and knowledgeable, and I have never seen someone fill my water glass as fast as Augustus' assistant. Though the prices may keep my friend and I away from casual dining here, we would enjoy returning again.
