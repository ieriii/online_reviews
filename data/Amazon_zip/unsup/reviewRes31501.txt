With far better and somehwat less expensive alternatives in town, Chicagoan's should skip this place and leave it for the unfortunate tourists. Perhaps its considered a fine dining stop in Phoenix but I'll be amazed if it cuts it in Chicago. Why? All smoke and mirrors and beyond amatuerish. I ordered the best champaign on the wine list for a special occasion. It came out slightly beyond tepid, was poured into our oversized flutes and after I advised the waiter that it was not acceptable it was wisked away in favor of a supposed new bottle which did not appear for a good 15 minutes.  Before that new bottle arrived, I was asked, out of earshot of my guests, if it would be o.k. to simply pour our portions back into the original bottle, chill it and re-serve.  I kid you not.  After I suggested that would be a touch tacky the new bottle arrived but it too was tepid. Next, my wife ordered fresh crab legs but they came out partially frozen and considerably waterlogged. When she ordered a different menu item as a replacement the waiter returned to say the restaurant was out of that alto it was only 7 p.m. All this ineptitude and at a price thats probably 10 - 15 percent higher than our other steak or steak and seafood places like Joe's.  The coup de grace... 48 hours later I received a call from a young women who had the phone etiquette of a high schooler to thank me for my recent patronage and to invite me to stop in again. I told her I would never return to the restaurant, encountered a long pregnant pause as if she had no idea what to say, then followed with a "thank you very much" . What was the purpose of that call? More smoke and mirrors Do yourself and your pocketbook a big favor, despite any hype...... SKIP THIS PLACE!
