let's go with 4.5 an excellent experience. largish group with varying tastes - they accommodated everybody's different spice threshold and recommended dishes for all to share, some for the spiceophiles and some for the spiceophobes.  The vindaloo is, yes, awesome. the Hyderabadi offerings are also fantastic.  Goat is also fantastic there.  try stuff that you otherwise wouldnt. you'll enjoy it :) bon apetit
