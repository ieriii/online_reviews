Found Glen[s Diner on Diners Drive-ins, & Dives, and I have been at least 5 times now! The black board selection of seafood is always overwhelming because there are so many great choices and I love that they are constantly making changes to the menu to keep it exciting. I've had tuna, salmon, swordfish and tilapia here ( with awesome glazes, crusts etc) and am always satisfied. They also have a to DIE for appetizer- the shrimp cargo- which is basically 5 pieces of shrimp drowning in butter and cheese that you eat with garlic bread. Do it. Trust me.
