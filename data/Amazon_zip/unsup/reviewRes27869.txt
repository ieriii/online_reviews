The food here is fresh, organic, and delicious! We arrived at 11:30am and there was a line out the door!!!! WHAT THE HECK?? There was about 20 people ahead of us but luckily we were able to snatch a seat. What I didnt understand was why there were so many open tables. I had asked to be seated at an open table for 2, but was told the table was unavailable. WHY?!?!?! They dont even take reservations so I dont understand why it was unavailable. Anyways, we were offered a counter seat and being crunched for time, we decided to take it. The menu here changes monthly so our waitress wasnt able to tell us what a signature dish is at this restaurant. So we ordered the guacamole as an appetizer. I ordered the Camarones a la Veraniega (garlic-marinated fresh Gulf shrimp served with daily-changing "rooftop salsa" of tomatoes and chiles from the restaurants rooftop garden, with green onion-studded Gulf-style white rice, cilantro salad) and my friend ordered the Milanesa de Puerco (crunchy-coated Maple Creek pork loin served with roasted tomato sauce, black beans and pickled red onions). Both dishes were delicious!!! And the seating at the bar was not uncomfortable at all. Overall a great experience!
