Chicago Scene named this place the best neighborhood bar for a reason...there's nothing to hate! I've been everywhere on Division and this place never disappoints. Everything from the service, to the food and drinks and the atmosphere, I can't complain.I try to come here as often as I can just because of the food. The burgers are amazing and you should get yours with a fried egg because that's an option here. The nachos are so good, and their gaucamole is very flavorful. The skirt steak sandwich on garlic bread makes my mouth water. I like what someone said about the cheese fries..just do it...don't even think about it!!Right now they are serving drinks in these plastic red cups which you can take home. Their draft beer selection is kind of weak, but I do enjoy my 312 so I'm happy to get the free cup because I have about 15 at this point. The service is always great, and I notice the same servers are working all the time which means they must not have much turnover here. I notice a lot of them chatting it up with the patrons and cracking jokes. We even got some free shots last time we came, our server told us she thought they tasted like gummy bears. They were chick shots, but strong. When you go to the basement, right above the stairs there is a sign that shows a comic strip of bobble heads downing drinks, the caption says "I think you should shut the fuck up" hilarious. This will be my destination for the upcoming sports seasons and I can't wait.
