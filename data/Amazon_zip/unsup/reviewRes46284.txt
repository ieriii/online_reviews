Grand Lux Cafe is my go-to restaurant when I have friends or family visiting the city. This place has EVERYTHING. You can have specialty drinks, wine, and appetizers in the bar or you can have a nice sit down meal. I like this place because it is not as expensive as other nicer Michigan Avenue restaurants but the waitstaff and hosts make you feel like a million dollars. The wait can be a bit excessive on Friday and Saturday nights, but if you go at non-peak hours or have time to wait, its not that big of a deal. I've gone for casual lunches but also went for New Years Eve dinner. My favorite dishes are the mashed potato eggrolls (sounds weird but seriously they are AMAZING) and the patty melt. They also have these baked to order desserts which are quite incredible. Also, if you can get a table by the windows, it is so fun to people watch and see the sky change from day to night.
