It's good... Basic and a little over priced in my opinion... But the food was solid and tasty. The hummus was standard. Dolma was a bit different than I've had before, but still good. I went with co workers who loved it. The atmosphere was great. It was pretty crowded for lunch on a Wednesday and I've walked by at night and it's always packed. Plus the restaurant is decorated beautifully, too.
