Anyone complaining about service here must have never been to a real Chinese restaurant. Sorry but service is unfortunately not the focus of most Chinese places, instead the food is where the focus is.There are two areas. One where you can sit and dine. The other where you walk in, attempt to decipher the scribbling on the board and order carry-out right from the cook's window. Love to order carry-out cause I can talk to the cooks and see what they like and have them show me where they are cutting from. BBQ pork is fantastic. Not too saucy and fatty. Lean, deep flavor. Just order a combo for two and judge for yourself.
