I would give this place 2 stars, however since it's a niche restaurant and unlike any other restaurant (except maybe melting pot) I'll bump it up to 3 stars. I'll try to make my assessment brief. I had a http://livingsocial.com deal which I'm sooo glad we did! I definitely would have felt this place was over priced without it. I guess my expectations were pretty high based on most of the glowing reviews. I was looking forward to a romantic dinner with good food. I don't think this place SCREAMS romance, unless your idea of romance is a dimly lit restaurant. The food was ok. My fave part of the meal was the cheese course and the dessert course. I had the chicken/shrimp combo and I thought the meat was pretty skimpy. I'm glad I went for the experience but I don't think I will go back. Oh and when we left out of there we stank like oil:(
