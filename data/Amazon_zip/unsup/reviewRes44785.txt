Giordano's isn't exactly deep dish but it is my favorite non-thin crust pizza in Chicago. Unlike Uno's, all Giordano's pizzas taste the same no matter which location you go to. So nice to know it is always going to taste good! The problem with the pizza is that I can never have more than 2 pieces. But lucky me that I always have leftovers the next day.
