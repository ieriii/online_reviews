Stayed four days two nights.Great large room. Select Guest Service thing was ok. I forgot to put the thing on the door one night until after 2am (yes i was out partying late!! ;)). No goodies. The 3rd night i forgot to put the delivery time (no goodies again). The staff was friendly but in that very vague robotic customer service way. The pool was great. I used that two of the three nights i stayed. Location was perfect. On Michigan had access to to the Red Line train and the buses on both Chicago Ave and Michigan Ave. It was overall very enjoyable stay.
