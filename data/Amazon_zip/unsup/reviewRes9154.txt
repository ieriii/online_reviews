Located right by the Kedzie Brown Line stop and on a busy road with a small parking lot to accomodate both the restaraunt and take out location. At first I walked into the take out location and the man behind the counter asked if I was looking for the restaraunt. I looked around and asked what I was standing in just to realize there were no tables LOL. Dinner started in a beautifully relaxed yet somewhat sophisticated setting. We were immediately greeted with warm pita bread and a variety of fixin's to go with it. We ordered hummus which was sooooo creamy and amazing! I had a glass of Pinot Noir with dinner. I got the chicken and ground beef combo kababs and my friend got the same except added a kabab of lamb. Both of us enjoyed the dill rice (mmmmmmmmm.....) and stuffed ourselves stupid. His lamb was cooked perfectly and all the kababs had a wonderful grill flavor. The chicken was tender and not chewy as grilled chicken can sometimes be. And even the ground beef kabab pleased my palate. The tab was a bit pricey but not too bad considering I had food to take home and the service was decent (it didn't wow me but it was fine). If I lived in the area I'd probably order to-go all the time but I certainly wouldn't avoid coming in to sit down and enjoy a good time with friends and family :-)
