Even though I have had better sushi elsewhere, it is nice to have Indie Cafe in the neighborhood. The sushi is not bad at all but the quality has been inconsistent. Strangely enough only with the more basic rolls? The Pad Thai and Rama Chicken are very good. I also like the fact that they have lunch specials. Nice atmosphere for dinner. The lighting and music is just right, the staff always friendly and the clientele a fair representation of the neighborhood.
