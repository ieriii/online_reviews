My friend and I went here for dinner last night. It was our first time there and the staff certainly made us feel comfortable. They ran thru the menu, gave us the run down and recommended 2 great bottles of wine. They even brought us their special sauces, try them they are delicious. To top it off Jeremy was amazing. He was a lot of fun and certainly went above and beyond. He even brought out a tasty dessert for us for our celebration!
