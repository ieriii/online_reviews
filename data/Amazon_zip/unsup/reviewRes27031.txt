We decided to embrace the line and wait for a table. We chatted it up in the bar with like minded customers while drinking exactly 2 margaritas before we were rewarded with a table.  It was fun and we met an interesting couple from Chicago. My first drink was the classic Fontera Margarita. YES, you should get one! Then I had a beautiful champagne enhanced margarita as the second. It was very light and didn't overpower me. Before we knew it our light flashed, we were seated , and our meal lay before us in all its splendor. started with: *fresh bay oysters  served with a choice of either tomatillo-habanero "minoeta" or smokey chipolte-garlic salsa LOVED LOVED LOVED  preferred them just with lime squeeze/ but they were good with the salsa as well  We wanted to maximize our experience and taste as much as possible. If you feel the same way order from the trios available on the menu and share with your table mate. We did and we left fully satisfied with our approach. We ordered the following entrees: *Old School Frontera Trio  -Smoked Chicken Taquitos (2 pieces) (wanted more they were so good) -Mexico City Style corn masa quesediallas (order these if you brought kids) -classic ceviche tostados (melts in your mouth/pops with freshness) *Mole Trio -mole pablano enchiladas (don't pass on the mole it is unforgettable) -grilled-seared pork manchamateles (mmmmmmm) -roasted vegetables-in green pumpkin seed mole (what a surprise / loved it) So happy we made it there and stayed to enjoy the night. Please don't let the line intimidate/discourage you from putting your name on the wait list . Dive into the bar and embrace the experience.
