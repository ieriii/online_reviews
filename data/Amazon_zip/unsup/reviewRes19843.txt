One of the best places to meet up with friends from out of town for a drink or a meal. You can't go wrong with the selections on the menu, and the big leather booths are so comfy you want to stay and chat for hours. The sandwiches are knife and fork style with delectable ingredients that are inventive and tasty. The ambiance has a historic, yet kind of trendy feel to it that lends well to an add'on visit to the art institute or stroll through the park.
