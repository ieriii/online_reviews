Grand Lux Cafe has an absolutely HUGE menu. So there is definitely something for everybody. They also have an eclectic assortment of drinks from which to choose as well as more than a few mouth watering desserts. Four of which you have to order in advance because they take a half hour or so to bake and prepare. A pet peeve of mine is having to cut my salad. Why would I want to chop my own salad? Maybe it's that restaurants leave the leaves whole for presentation or whatever but I'd rather have my salad cut up and ready to go. I ordered the caesar and as you can imagine, the leaves were left whole. So I had to dig in with fork AND knife. They had a nice parmesan crusted topping though which was excellent. The service was good. The portions are huge. I think this place is a tad bit over-priced given the fact that it's a glorified cheesecake factory. But it'll do when you're indecisive about what you feel like eating because well, like I said, they have everything.
