I hate being compared to other people so I am not going to compare Lockdown to Kumas as much as I want to with all of its similarities. Try to time your visit on one of the many Lockdown specials throughout the week or buy a gift certificate. Once you find street parking, you will enter to find Lockdown has loud metal music for your night ahead. The place is not the biggest so be prepared to eat at the bar. The service is quick and attentive to your needs. The beer options are great on its own with draft choices such as Dead guy, Hobgoblin, and Matilda for under $6. The reason that has me coming back is the food. The burgers are delicious and so is the mac and cheese. I am not going to recommend one because each burger has its own specialty. I will warn you though the Aarson is HOT! The Empty bottle is across the street so if you plan it right you can also catch a show for a nightcap.
