We recently moved to the West Loop and happened to walk by this place while exploring our new 'hood. We went in for the baklava and a coffee, and found much much more. Tons of pastries, 2 or 3 three kinds of baklava (almonds? walnuts? rolled?), tons of coffee concoctions (but also the yummy traditionals), salads, pizzas, cocktails, wine....you name it, they have it. We stuck with our original plan of baklava and coffee, but will definitely go back for the rest. I was pleasantly surprised when I ordered a single shot espresso and the waitress came back with what was easily four shots of steaming hot espresso. Gotta love that.
