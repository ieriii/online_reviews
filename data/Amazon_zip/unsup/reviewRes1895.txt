I used to go to Hot Doug's back in High School (4 years ago). This was at its first location, before the fire. I remember going everyday for lunch with a group of my friends, and Doug had all of our orders memorized! It was amazing how he did it! I haven't been to the new location yet but seeing all of these reviews makes me crave it so bad! I will definitely be heading over sometime this summer.
