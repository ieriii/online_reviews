This is not your average supermarket. If you want average, you go to Dominicks or Jewel Osco. You'll find here what you won't find in any other grocery store. From foreign exotic goods to the daily morsel desires. I never thought I'd be giving a 5-star review to a "market" but Fox & Obel deserves it. Here are 5 things I absolutely love about this place: 1. Foreign Goods. I once needed to find sticky rice (Korean/Japanese style). I wasn't going to drive all the way North into the suburbs. My sushi needed the rice pronto. I ran to Dominicks; didn't find it there. Guess where I find my sticky rice? Yup - at Fox & Obel. 2. Better Fruits & Vegetables. The fruits and vegetables are very high quality. Fresh. Never did I need to pick and be choosy. You'll also find exotic fruits like Star Fruit and Kumquats. 3. Cafe/Restaurant. The dining goods here are quite amazing. I especially recommend brunch here. The eggs Benedict is to die for. The fruit french toast is also quite delicious (especially if you have a sweet tooth). 4. Cheese Selection. I'm not a huge cheese fan. But I really got into truffle cheese (thanks to the cheese guys at Fox & Obel). You can sample any cheese before you buy your cheese here. I highly recommend their cheese selections. Very personable cheese servers who will cater to your cheese choices. 5. Bakery. The bakery here is amazing! You can get your seasonal goods. But what I love is their baguette (freshly baked everyday) and their seasonal goodies (like the zucchini bread). They offer free 2-hour parking for all those that grocery shop there. I think my 5-star there is well deserved. Yup yup.
