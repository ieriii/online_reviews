Maybe I should have read reviews of this place before I went, but it was a bit too experimental for me. Here is an example of a dish we had: three pieces of well prepared lamb, with 60 possible sauces/herbs/fruits for you to choose to eat the lamb with. Did I seriously just drop almost $300 to compose my own dishes? I'm certainly no expert at doing this and definitely made some suboptimal choices. And do people really like the dessert where they drop things everywhere? It's a cool show but taste-wise, it was pretty far from the best desserts I've had. I have to give it 4*s because a few of the courses were among the best dishes I've ever had, in terms of taste and presentation. Some of my favorites, without going into too much detail for fear of ruining it for others, included an otoro course and a lobster/crab dish. Just know what your getting yourself into: it's much hype, not everything will be even close to the best things you've ever tasted, there won't be as much meat/seafood as courses at other restaurants (one course was only ginger), the reservation system where you buy your table in advance with no ability to change it at all is highly obnoxious and shows how pretentious these people are (no other top restaurants in the country do this). But the presentation of the food was by far the best I've ever experienced. So there are some things to cheer about.
