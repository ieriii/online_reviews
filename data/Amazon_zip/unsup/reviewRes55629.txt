Went on a Saturday night and didn't have to wait a minute. The place is big, with a simple but nice atmosphere (lots of exposed brick)- we got a table on the back patio. The menu contains delights from both Mexican and Cuban influence. The food is excellent and the portions hearty. I had the Cuban Style Chicken, which was great and the plantains were delicious. The Jalepeno Mashed Potatoes are equally as amazing.Can't wait to go back and try some more Cuban dishes (and more plantains!) I will be coming back, and in greater numbers.
