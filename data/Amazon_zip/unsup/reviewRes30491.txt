MAKE RESERVATIONS IN ADVANCE! We did a birthday dinner for 4 and could not add more people for Saturday night at 7:00. Unless we wanted to change it to 5:30 or 9:30. All other restaurants in the River North area were booked with reservations too. Billy Dec did awesome. The interior design of this restaurant is amazing, the lighting, to the furnishings, to the intricate designs all over the restaurant. I still have to check out his other restaurants. This place is known to the best, and it is. Welcoming greetings and complimentary coat checks are offered. Here is what we ordered: -Eggplant and Tofu Toban -Sticky-Icky Rice (comes in 2) - wasn't the favorite -Rock Shrimp Tempura (A MUST!) -Sweet Potato Caterpillar -Dragon (Very Tasty) We were too full for desert, but I'm sure it would have been awesome. The restaurants philosophy is to "share" and it satisfies 7 types of Asian cultures (learned from our waiter). Our waiter was busy, was sweating but he knew the menu well. Our food came 15 minutes after ordering too, which was awesome. They have special events here, like NYE parties and such, but I may have to wait for a raise to attend! :) Here's the dinner menu: http://www.sundachicago.
