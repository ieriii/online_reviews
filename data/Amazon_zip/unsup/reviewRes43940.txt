We just had our first visit to Milk and Honey. It was profoundly disappointing. Starting with a curt and officious order taker at the counter, we felt like they were in a hurry for us to eat and leave. We were seated by the side door (freezing). The quiche was dry and not anything special.  We had to bus our own table and there is a sign asking you to continue your conversation at the bar as soon as you are done eating. Overall experience: B-. We will not return, ever.
