My husband and I tried this place on Saturday and we loved it so much that we came back on Sunday as well. It's been a long time since a new restaurant has impressed us this much and since we are die-hard foodies, that is saying something. Our top two faves were the truffle egg toast and the ricotta and honeycomb. To die for. Seriously.  Other hits were the polenta with the ragu of the day (we had pork shoulder) and the sea urchin linguine with crab. The big ravioli dish was good as well but yeah, a bit hard to justify $9 for that.  The one "miss" for us surprisingly was the seared octopus. After so many glowing reviews, I was surprised we weren't a fan of this. I'm thinking it must have been an off day because the octopus was chewy and not tender like so many others have exclaimed.  I'm already excited for my next visit there...gotta try the risotto and pizzas! Oh, and all of the staff is very friendly there but Erik really stood out! He was super friendly and funny but you can tell he also had a real passion for the food.
