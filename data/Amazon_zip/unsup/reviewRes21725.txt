come for half price margaritas on tuesday and thursday, like everyone says. on monday, wednesday, friday, saturday, and sunday, i would stick with a sober meal. at half price, you feel like you're getting a pretty good deal for a pitcher ($20), but there are better ways of spending forty bucks five out of seven days of the weeks. the salsa is spicy, the fish tacos were tasty, and ... there's an outside patio! bam, sold. see you there (on tues/thurs).
