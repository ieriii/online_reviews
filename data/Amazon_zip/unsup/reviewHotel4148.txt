To close out a week in Chicago we stayed at the Hyatt Regency. This Hotel is HUGE! The fact that they give you a map upon check-in confirmed just how big it was. Great hotel for a last minute stay right in the thick of everything. We were able to walk/shop down Michigan Ave. and relax at the bar. Great atmosphere, nice decor. Not a fan of their shuttle service and the although the bar is SUPER nice the service is SUPER horrible.
