5 stars, they earned every one of them too! This is our go to lunch place. The food is simply outstanding. Today's lunch consisted of an Olympian pizza, a rustic Grecco pizza, and the hummus plate appetizer - we actually would have licked this plate clean if we were not in public! After lunch instead of desert I had a Coffee Americano, that was near perfect. Love this place, it's cute, service is great, I wish it was closer so I could go more often!
