My girlfriend and I went to Shaw's because i have heard from others that they have the best crab legs in town. We weren't disappointed. Reservations were made for 6pm on a Saturday. We arrived on time and was seated immediately. The concierge offered to check in our coat for us which i thought was a nice touch. I can tell they wanted us to know we'll be taken care of at Shaw's. The waiter was very knowledgeable of the menu, very polite and did a fabulous job. The food was incredible. We both ordered the Alaskan king crab. The sizes of these legs were so huge and delicious. We both felt we have eaten the best crab ever in our lives. I definitely got my moneys worth. Hands down the best in the city, if not the entire Midwest. I highly recommend Shaw's Crab House for its fresh food and excellent service.
