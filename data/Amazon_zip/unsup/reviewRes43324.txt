This is hands-down the best pan pizza you'll get in town - taste and money wise. The think crust ones are not as special but what do you expect - that is not what they are famous for. They also open somewhat late-ish (11pm), so if you are in the adjacent neighborhoods and needs some fueling up before your night really begins, totally stop by and grab a piece.
