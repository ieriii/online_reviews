I love that this place is BYOB. We brought a bottle of wine to split. The table next to us had a six-pack of beer and wine. The large party behind us? A bottle of vodka. For an appetizer my friend and I split yellowtail carpaccio, which was amazing. It came with five pieces, so I was secretly delighted when my friend told me to take the last piece. I highly recommend starting with this. The flavor and freshness was right on. Per our servers recommendation, we ordered the White Dragon Maki-- a shrimp tempura, wasabi tobiko, cream cheese avacado roll topped with scallion spicy sauce, wasabi dressing, eel sauce, and tempura crumb. (Wowza,) I was a little worried that the roll with be huge with all the ingredients, but it was perfectly proportioned. Bite-sized and delicious. With it we ordered the Coast Crab, spicy white tuna and yellowtail scalion maki. All were great, and we left full. I would definitely come back here and give it 4 stars.
