Very nice ambiance. Several couches if you just wanted to chill. We sat in a table for 2 where I was on the bench side. I really liked the lighting. Several wines & beers to choose from. The food is meant for sharing. Everything was very good. We started with the sweet balsamic /roasted garlic on toast. It was warm crusty bread served over a sweet balsamic and pieces of roasted garlic. Different, but very yummy. We then had the pork meatballs over polenta. These were very flavorful. Next we had the chilled Hamachi Crudo. Excellent. We also had the frites which were a little salty, but very good. We look forward to going back. They had a few outdoor tables if you want to sit outside.
