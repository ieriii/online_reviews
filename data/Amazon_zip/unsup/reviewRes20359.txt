Gage...how can I put this in plain english our group of 15 paying customers is reprimanded by the manger Pat in a Chicago establishment for cheering for the Bulls on a 52 in flat screen tv at the bar...his exact words, "if you want to cheer on the Bulls go to a sports bar down the street" place is stuffier then your nose during flu season...had one round of overpriced drinks and the service is lackluster at best...any Chicago fan of any team shouldn't float this place a penny.
