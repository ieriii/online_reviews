First off the drinks are mixed very well and are very good. They are the only reason why you would be a patron of this place.  Costumer service, the worst i've ever had. The doorman, took my cell phone # to call me when a table was ready. So I went across the street with my partner to Pontiac Cafe for some drinks outside while we waited. While we waited, we watched people entering and no one leaving as we sat outside. Uhh, where is OUR table? The doorman called an hour later. When my partner and I were finally seated, we realized half the bar was empty and most of the tables were empty. We were furious. We waited that long so we ordered drinks. The drinks took another 20+ minutes to make. Again, the place was deserted. I have never felt so insulted from poor service. It seemed very personal.
