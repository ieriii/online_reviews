Wow... wow. The Crostini di Avocado appetizer was incredible. For the main course we split two dishes - the Osso Bucco & Gnocchi Seafood dish were full of flavor and they don't mess around with portion size! If you've already got your Chicago-style pizza fix, this is the other MUST have in town. Service was great and informative, owner happened to be present and attentive. I'm budget oriented, but the dishes here were worth every penny. Can't wait to come back!
