So today I decided to take a tour along the # 36 bus route. My plan was to ride it to the end of the line which is Devon but once I saw Sun Wah's, I remembered there were several places in particular I had been wanting to hit up. Soooo, I just said eff it, I'll hop off here. I walked in and instantly I am taken aback by the sight of hanging meat. I don't know why. I have definitely seen hanging meat before but it just did something to me. I actually walked in/out several times. I stopped people to get feedback and the regulars had only good things to say about the food, especially the duck. I decided to get some ribs even after reading Johnny T's glowing review. I know I cheated myself but I felt I needed to play it safe. The ribs were very tender. There was nothing fancy or spectacular about them but they were seasoned just right. They are served with a small container of soy sauce instead of barbecue sauce. It worked though. So the ribs were okay, the service was quite speedy, the prices are okay, but the portion size was a tad bit on the small side. I'll be back and be a bit more adventurous.
