Unfortunately, wasn't that impressed by Sunda. We (3 of us) were seated in the lounge section - very uncomfortable, and our waitress was a flake.  We ordered the Dragon roll as an app - which was pretty good. My husband had the BBQ pork that he liked, but thought was rather fatty.  We shared three entrees - the chicken, the cod and the beef short rib. The chicken and cod were really good - the beef short rib had a lot of fat on it - also wasn't very interesting. The bok choi puree that came along with it was not good.  We ordered dessert also - the sesame pudding was pretty awful - we sent it back, but the molten lava cake wasn't bad.  For the prices I was expecting a lot more. The ambience was good - nothing I was really struck by though. The best part of Sunda was the company my husband, his old boss and I shared.
