I was here for a Bachelorette party and from researching restaurants, chose this location. We were seated right away, which was a bonus! Our server, Liz, was extremely knowledgeable when it came to the menu. I had a lemony martini with some wasabi in it and thought it was pretty good. I tried the strawberry martini and that was excellent. I ordered the prawn rangoon and the baked soft shell crab hand roll. I was not expecting the prawns to come with head and tail still attached, so that creeped me out a bit, but Liz explained how to eat them and dinner resumed. The hand roll was great. I also tried the egg rolls which were good. Some of the girls at the table raved about the lobster roll. I though the steamed buns were not good, but maybe just not up my alley as they were really doughy. We had the ridiculous dessert and it was just that! Glad we shared! Also, the bread pudding, not up my alley, but some of the other girls said it was quite good. Restrooms are downstairs, so watch yourself if you have had a couple of drinks! :) A great experience and I would definitely ask for Liz again!
