This has been our favorite sushi rest for the past 18 months! We go almost every Friday night and also love the BYOB. Being a sushi fan since the early eighties (yes 1982 was my 1st experience), I've tried may places in the Chicagoland area. Indie Cafe offers some of the best sushi out there BUT what makes it even better is their prices! Many over rated sushi rests in the city with ridiculous prices on their food and wine, Indie wins hands down!! Our favorite waitress is Taya!
