As always I had the best meal here on Friday night. We made 8:00 reservations and we usually need to wait (even when we have reservations), but we were fortunate enough to get right in. We started with the crabcake appetizer, which I think is the first time I've tried it at wildfire. Like everything at wildfire it was very good. Then we had my favorite chopped salad- the small was so big that we only ate half of it. I had the halibut dish and my boyfriend ate the steak trio. He tried the bluecheese, horseradish, and double baked potato crusts. I tasted them all and the double baked potato one was amazing. I wish I could have had room for the skillet cookie dessert, but we were just too full from all the food. Next time I want to save room for the dessert tray.
