My favorite restaurant during my trip to Chicago. I read some reviews and ordered similar items that others have tried and I loved every single dish. Started with the sweetbreads (never had it before but was delish), puff pastry w bleu cheese (cheesy and tasty), bone marrow with crostinis (my favorite) and wild boar sloppy joe. These dishes were the perfect size to split and it was more than enough food for two. For dessert, we tried the cornbread pudding (how do you make this?! I want to know!) and crispy chocolate thing w Fernet. I was in heaven. Definitely worth trying out. I left more than happy :) Come to San Francisco and open a L&E!
