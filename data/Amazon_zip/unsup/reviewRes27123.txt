If you like mexican food cooked with Lard, continue to read this. I've been going to this place for over 30 years and it's still great. My arterties may not like me going there but I still do as I love introducing others to it. I remember when it was just the front area and that was it. I love it's a BYOB and the price is sooo inexpensive. Good authentic food, good service and a lively atmosphere makes this place great!
