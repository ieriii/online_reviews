My favorite breakfast place in Chicago, and that is saying a lot considering breakfast is the favorite meal of my day! I have tried many many many breakfast places in the city and this takes the cake. Red velvet pancakes are something I dream about. The menu changes with the season, not sure how I feel about that because my beloved 4 berry pancakes are gone now :(
