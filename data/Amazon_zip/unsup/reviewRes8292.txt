Very pleased with my pizza experience here last Friday...... Arrived as a party of 3 around 8pm.....there were a couple of other groups ahead of us...but we didn't wait longer than 5 minutes and bingo! our table was ready! We each got a pizza all were red sauce based Funghi e Salsiccia: This baby was mine.....and it was delicious! Mushrooms, basil, sausage and mozzarella.....crust is thin but slightly chewy (I actually wish it was crisper) perfect ratio of toppings to sauce to cheese.....mmmmmmm.....mmmmmm.....good! Diavola: Bf's pie....mozzarella, basil, red pepper flakes and spicy salami......I had a piece....it was yummy but certainly not as spicy as I wanted it to be.......with a name like diavola they should bump up the heat. Funghi: Our friends choice....I actually did not try it....but apparently she gets this almost every time she eats there and loves it!! Tiramisu: Yum!! Pretty authentic tiramisu.....lady fingers held up under the mascarpone and had just the right amount espresso squish......perfect! Service Our waitress was quick but friendly.....couldn't ask for much more! Ambiance I believe there are 3 rooms....we ate in the 2nd....wall are a cheery yellow.....lights were up....it was loud but not obnoxious.....good place for a casual date or a dinner with friends. Overall Happy Happy......I would eat here more often if it were anywhere near where I lived......
