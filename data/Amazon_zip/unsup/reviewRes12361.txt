For those looking for some Latin fare on their rotation of places to dine, Cafe 28 definitely does not miss the mark by much. Just down the street from my old elementary school at St. Benedict's, this place bolsters a lively atmosphere and a distinctively flavorful meal enjoyed both by young professionals and families alike. I give major props to the wife on this recommendation. Friendly waiting staff and prompt food service made the evening flow seamlessly. There are two dining areas and one bar area near the entrance. Free parking can be found 1/2 block past the bridge east of the restaurant on the left. They do have drink specials Monday-Thursday and a brunch option. Moderately priced, but left satisfied. Loved the spicy honey butter spread for the bread. What we ordered: - Pappas rellenas - recommend - Honey jalapeno pork chops - recommend (enough to share between two people) - caipirinha cocktail When we went: - Friday @ 7:00 PM and did not wait for a table Will we return: - definitely
