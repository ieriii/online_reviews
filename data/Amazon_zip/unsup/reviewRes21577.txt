The best hot dogs in Chicago. I also like the fries that come with the hot dogs. DO NOT get the burgers--they're not good or worth the price! I've also had the shakes and malts, and they're also some of the best I've had. My husband is a total malt fan, and he said they're the best he's ever had. If you want to watch your diet, don't go here. But if you're really hungry and want to eat a meal that will fill you up for hours, this is the place. Note: I went to the Super Dawg in Midway Airport--they were AWFUL--the worst I've had! Everything was horrible--even the malts, shakes, and fries. Do NOT go there--it's not the same quality as this location. It was so bad, I wanted to ask for my money back (which is impossible, of course). We even threw out our malt, which we've never done before.
