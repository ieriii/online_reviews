this used to be my favorite restaurant in Chinatown. As the restaurant has gotten more popular, the size of their dishes have shrunken by a lot, although I guess by regular (non-chinatown) standards they still give huge portions for reasonable prices. Whenever I eat here, i always order the same things and they've never disappointed. Fu Qi Fei Pian for an appetizer, shui zhu rou (I always scope the chili flakes off the top first), pao cai yu (love the pickled veggies), and the chili chicken which I can't remember the chinese name for and usually just point to it on the menu. I've gotten hot pot here only once and it was also a great deal. Lots of meats and seafood for under $30 bucks
