Nice and comfortable place for breakfast and brunch. Good selection on their menu and everything sounds delicious. The food comes in big quantities so don't order too much.  We had the chorizo-avocado omelette and the vanilla bean-strawberry brioche french toast; both were really good. The table next to us had cool mugs for their drinks and upon asking, we found out it was their hot chocolate drink. We'll have to try to that next time.  Overall, I would recommend this place to people. The brunch menu is only available on the weekends and includes items like the eggs benedict and tenderloin of beef burrito.
