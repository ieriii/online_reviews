You really cannot beat the margarita special at this place, especially since it's half price two days a week (Tues and Thurs). I'm not a big fan of eating entrees at Mexican restaurants, although every once in a while I do (too much cheese and tortilla gets to me). But I love going later in the evening, getting margaritas, appetizers (they are generous with their guacamole portions unlike many places), and dessert (love their flan). The service is really good (even though they probably aren't thrilled that we aren't ordering actual meals), and it's a really cute and cozy place.
