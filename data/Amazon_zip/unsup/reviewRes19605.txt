The XOCO hype is worth it in fits and starts. The fact that Rick Bayless actually came in while I was there was pretty fun. 1. Chips and guac are amazing. 2. My pepito sandwich was a greasy, glorified Philly Cheese Steak. I only ate half of it. 3. The hot chocolate is fantastic!!! I would skip the line to order it and take it out. I'm glad I went, but I think it might have been a one-time thing.
