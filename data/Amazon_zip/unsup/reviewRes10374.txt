Ridiculously Awesome. First off, my sincerest thanks to our server Franco. He was the balls. My gf and I went there for our anniversary dinner, and he made it awesome. The food was really incredible. The staff, from the valet dudes outside, to the three hosts out front, to the bus staff were all super friendly. We sat inside, but within view of the outdoor garden seating, which looked idyllic. The wine selection is huge, and contains a fair number of reasonably priced bottles. Franco's rec's were spot on. Collectively, Piccolo Sogno provided an warm ambiance that really can't be matched by any resto in chicago. And I mentioned that it was our anniversary to the host over the phone (also very sweet). It wasn't even brought up until dessert, as the chef prepared a special desert with Happy Anniversary written on the plate in chocolate. Nice. Great Food, Great Service, Great Wine, Great Franco. Oh, and the legit balsamic and olive oil at the table is reason enough.
