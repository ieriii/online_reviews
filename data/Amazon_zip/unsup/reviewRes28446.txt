Overall great experience, great food, loved everything. First let me just say I love the popcorn/bread coarse, as others said the popcorn came out slightly cold, but the flavor more than made up for it. apps Beets - great salad, when you got a bite of everything together (the marmalade was a little bit overpowering, but as long as you got only a little bit in each bite it really brightened the dish) Duck - good, not especially memorable, but I cant think of any complaints about the dish Mains Chicken - Recommended by the waiter, good and really fun, the foot beer bbq sauce was great and the greens and grit cake went perfectly with the chicken. chicken was also cooked well. Beef - Beef was fall apart tender, melt in your mouth goodness. the Foie Consomme also added this great flavor to everything. the little slices of confit potatoes underneath everything were ridiculously good. Scallops - Perfectly cooked, perfectly seared evenly on both sides, beautiful color on all of them, and they tasted really fresh. everything else on the dish went really well with the scallops without overpowering them. dessert Chocolate - really beautiful and fun dessert. extra points for the chocolate covered pop rocks. everything else we went there on an Wednesday night so it wasn't too busy, we found street parking on the same block. wait staff was really nice and attentive. atmosphere was great (its hard not to like a "fine dining" place that plays Sufjan Stevens and Jimmy Eat World) 2 apps, 3 mains, and one dessert came out to about $160
