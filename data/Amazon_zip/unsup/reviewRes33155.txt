Yesterday I had a "girls night out" at this place. Service excellent or should I say more than that - we GOT very SPECIAL attention - thank you!!! We started with .... MARTINIS - lemon drop and cosmo - great!!! Food was very good - We went for red Borsch soup - omg - the size of the bowl - it was almost like an entree itself - very good flavor. we shared two appetizers: fried calamari - they were crispy and nice and Vinete - eggplant spread (recommended by our waiter) - wow - that was delicious. We also shared our main entrees: veal paprikash was our favorite - creamy sauce with a touch of sweetness perfectly blended with polenta, stuffed chicken tights were served with different type of polenta - taste was nice, gulas - delicious - beef was melting in the mouth and vegetables were giving different taste in comparison to other entrees. Dessert - it's another story - again DELICIOUS - apple strudel with ice cream, chocolate ganache and apricot crepes - melting in the mouth. We were happy with our choices - 3 samples - 3 different tastes - 3 winners! And amazing owner and our waiter who made our dining even more fun!!!
