Q: How many oysters can two women eat? A: Too many. So many that when we ordered more, the server pretended to misunderstand us. That, my friends, is a lot of oysters. Our Shaw's experience was freakin' awesome! Thanks, Yelpers, for giving us the heads up about the happy hour. We ordered a few things, but the serious standouts were the oysters. Large, plump oysters, lovingly arranged on a massive plate of ice. The most adorable little bottles of tabasco sauce were tucked between the oysters. The service was okay. I didn't really appreciate the server pretending to misunderstand our request for more oysters, but, in all fairness, it was probably time to stop eating so many oysters. Plus, my dirty martini was pretty darn good, so how could I hate on this place? Go for the oysters!
