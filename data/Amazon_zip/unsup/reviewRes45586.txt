Seriously the best veggie burgers I have had ... ever! We ordered a few appetizers to share and each person ordered a main dish. We had too much food, next time we'll probably skip the appetizers. This place is large and has a good atmosphere. Music playing, lots of people. Has a homey feel. There is a "library" section in one area that looked kinda cool (Wilde was a writer). Service is good too.
