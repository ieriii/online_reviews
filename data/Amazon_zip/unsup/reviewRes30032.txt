Since I'm not a vegetarian this wouldn't be my first pick, but I went with a veggie friend for lunch who had been dying to try this place. And, honestly, I've been curious myself for years.  We went right after the tsunami/earthquake in Japan so they were donating a portion of the sales to help with disaster relief - nice touch!  We ordered: * Mozzarella Teese Sticks (breaded vegan cheese sticks by Chicago SoyDairy, served with zesty marinara) * Titanic BLT Burger (seitan patty stuffed with corn, peppers & onions, topped with Upton's Naturals veggie bacon, french fried onions, vegan BBQ mayo, lettuce & tomato, on a toasted multi-grain wheat bun) *Special Shamrock Shake The green shake was the best, by far. It tasted like a mint chocolate chip (my favorite) shake. Yum.... The burger and cheese sticks were alright, but I'd prefer real cheese in my sticks and real meat in my burger. :) My veggie friend LOVED everything. So, I recommend to vegetarians/vegans, but not to meat-eaters.
