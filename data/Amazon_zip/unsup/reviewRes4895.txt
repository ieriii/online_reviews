"Cheese, Swine & Wine" Yea, that's pretty much all you need to know! This place is an awesome hang out for groups. I can see how easy it'd be to sit around for hours with beers/wines and an assortment of tapas that they offer. The razor clams had to be my favorite dish. Savory, tangy and chewy. I love the texture and the natural ocean flavor of clams. The fried pig ears seem to be a favorite with reviewers, but I wasn't wow'ed. I mean, you couldnt really taste the pig ears. I could have been eating pieces of fried dough for all I know. Local or tourist, definitely a place you should check out. I wish they had a place like this in SF. Hey, someone open one up! NOW! Oink oink.
