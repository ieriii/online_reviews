I wanted My Pie for lunch but it was closed, thankfully this was across the street and open. Service was friendly and fast for lunch. Bruschetta was ok-I've had better. My friend had ravioli in meat sauce. The sauce was the best part, I kept stealing some for my bread:) I had the mac and cheese-yum!! It has brocoli in it and it was topped with herbed bread crumbs-I want some just thinking about it. Both dishes came with a fresh bread. Plenty in the portions-you could share. They had other interesting pasta's that I will definitely be back to try.
