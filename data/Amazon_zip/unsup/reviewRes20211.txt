we were in town for 24 hours for the chicago marathon. after my fiancee ran a personal record, we went back to our hotel to shower and change before making our afternoon flight. we asked the concierge at the JW Marriott, what they recommended and they said well chicago is known for pizza and steaks. we were not in the mood for either, so they suggested the gage. WHAT A FABULOUS SUGGESTION!  even though it was marathon day, we were able to get in without a wait for 2 within our 10 minute walk from the hotel to the restaurant. the hostesses were accommodating and sat us immediately. we got TREMENDOUSLY lucky that we were seated in Megan's section. she was a ridiculous waitress! we had no idea what we were in the mood for but 100% wanted to splurge and have a celebratory post-marathon meal. we started with the Gage N-17 "Fondue - which was DELISH!!! I MEAN DELISH!! i wanted to use my finger to wipe the pot clean...yum-o melted brie!! how could you go wrong?! megan was super knowledgeable about beer choices. i had a good bloody mary to start. after doing some beer tastings, we decided on a Affligem and a beer from their seasonal libation menu that was comparable to an anchor steam. after our brie app, we had a "The Gage" USDA Prime Burger and a Roasted Woodland Mushrooms sandwich. had a great meal in chicago and truly a wonderful experience at the restaurant. will highly recommend to friends traveling through.
