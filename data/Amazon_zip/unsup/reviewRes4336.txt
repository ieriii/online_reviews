Wonderfully cheesy faux-Renaissance artwork and sculptures line the walls of this place. The drinks are reasonably priced. There will be a cover but in almost all cases it will be worth paying because the place attracts the best local and international players. And because the place brings in the big players, expect to keep quiet while they are playing - this is a place to see good jazz - not have some pleasant background music while you get drunk and chat with your friends (don't worry though, there is plenty time to chat between sets and after the show). Oh! and if you happen to check out local sax legend Von Freeman there sometime, scope his piano player, Ben Paterson - one of the most underrated players in the city.
