So I went to the newly remodeled Garcias and I was very happy with the new and improved place!!! First of all it was wayy bigger ( I think they added next door building to the place). The food was good but the salsa seemed to taste different. The service was the same with all random people serving you it's kinda hard to tell who your real server is. Other than that it was nice.  I heard there was long waiting when they first reopened, but i am unsure how it is currently. Bottom line the food is cheap, tasty and the serving size is big. The service will continue to be average and the atmosphere is improved. I would go again!!!
