This place is the best deep dish pizza I have ever been to. The selections are countless, and the quality of the ingredients is supurb. We had a small sausage and mushroom pizza, and it was more than enough for 2 people. There was a lot of cheese, and you could taste the quality. The sausage was really fresh, and didn't taste like typical pizza sausage. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for Classic Chicago deep dish pizza!!
