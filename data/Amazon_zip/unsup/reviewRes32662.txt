I've been hanging on to a Groupon from last May waiting to make a return visit to Demera. I hadn't been back since a friend's birthday party about 2 years ago. This place has changed. I'm not saying it is in a bad way, the food is still great, but it's definitely a little more swanky and I think a little more expensive. Hubs and I were happy to see that the food is still the same deliciousness that we were hoping for, and we even had the very same waitress we had 2 years ago. We actually sat at the bar, which I would highly recommend if the place is crowded. You'll get great service, you might get free shots, and you will be a little removed from the noise. All in all, this is a great date night location. I don't know that I would recommend it anymore for large groups, which is how Hubs and I had originally experienced it.
