I ordered "The Warden," it was delivered on time. I asked for it to be cooked between medium and medium rare, but it was completely raw in the middle. The flavor was disgusting, over seasoned and old - I feel slightly nauseous. The cheese that oozed out the middle of this burger was a luke warm mystery fluid surrounded by raw meat that was rancid and sticky - I am afraid that I will become ill from the little bit I did managed to choke down. The fries were undercooked and soggy - they probably would have been OK if cooked properly. This is the most unfortunate experience I have had yet at a restaurant in Chicago.
