They did a brilliant job hosting a single-malt scotch tasting this evening--really good food, good service, intelligent logistics so that the crowd never got all that much in each other's way. I plan to spend some time this winter in the downstairs garden/sunporch/fireplace area. The host was also very cool, welcoming a bunch of us in at the door chivalrously while greeting us collectively as "women"--a nice variant that reminded me of a friend who addresses gatherings that include me and other women as "ladies and Suzanne."  That said, I wouldn't come here to consume huge quantities of expensive meat, and the atmosphere has big pretentiousness potential. But also offbeat nicely designed bar potential.
