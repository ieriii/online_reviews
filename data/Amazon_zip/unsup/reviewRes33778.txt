I was really hesitant to go.... breakfast food has been such a disappointment lately for me. To my surprise... I recommend!!! Parking sucks. There's a garage right next door and Yolk will validate it so that it's $7 instead of $9. Must get: strawberry orange juice. Very delicious. Can't think of any other spot that has something similar. I got the Zamboni crepes: ham, spinach, hollandaise sauce, scrambled eggs, and i'm sure something else..... =) i added mushrooms. Cuz I'm a mushroom junkie. I really liked it! The crepes were fluffy. Not flat or super delicate. But almost meat-y! But still sweet and light. No sogginess here. The potatoes that came with it are also really good too. Flavored, good on texture, good on salt. Just the portions are HUGE!! Came with two crepes. I finished only about 3/4 of one and got full. My bf got somethin else. Can't remember. I was too interested in mine. But there are definitely a lot of things that look real interesting on the menu, So I'll definitely be back for more.
