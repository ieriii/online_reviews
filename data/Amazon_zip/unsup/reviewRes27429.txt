In a city full of awesome pizza joints, Pequod's easily holds its own.  What makes it so good is that it is completely different from other pizzas in town. The standard Pequod's pie falls somewhere between the ubiquitous Chicago deep-dish and the standard delivery fare. The crust is thick, but light and buttery, the sauce is substantial, but not too sweet, and the burnt, crispy cheese hugging the crust is a thing of beauty. Sure, once you knock down a couple slices, you'll feel like an aggressive baby is trying to punch his way out of your stomach. But I'm a firm believer that sometimes you need to suffer for your food.
