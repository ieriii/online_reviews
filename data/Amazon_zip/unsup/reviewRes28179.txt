I went here last night with my husband for dinner. Overall, I was really impressed. The atmosphere is just awesome. You get great innovative food and good service in a very laid back environment. I started with the crispy buffalo chicken. It was interesting and tasted really good. It had just the right amount of heat. I then had the heritage pork loin. To me it was just okay and why I am giving four stars. The pork was served on top of farro which was just blah to me and overwhelmed the plate. Now my husband's meal was incredible and I don't even like seafood. He started with the lobster corn dog. It was crispy and the lobster was cooked perfectly. He then ordered the pan roasted scallop. It was just awesome and very well seasoned. We ended with the strawberry shortcake, which was my favorite part. I probably could have licked the plate clean if they hadn't taken it away already.
