Mastros is amazing!!! Five starts, two thumbs up, a 10, whatever rating scale you go by, this place rocks.  I took my fiance here for his birthday, who is die-hard Gibsons fan. We both loved it, although his ego won't let him admit that he liked it more than Gibsons.  Our waitress was super helpful. She recommended the shrimp cocktail, which were HUGE and came out in a smoking dish filled with dry ice. I felt like we were in the movie Beetlejuice. I also had the lobster bisque which was sooo good, and also huge. The steaks were great; my fillet melted in my mouth like butter. And nothing compliments steak better than lobster sauteed in garlic and butter atop mashed potatoes, also recommended by our fantastic server. Everything was like heaven! We even had the most amazing dessert, although I can't remember now what it was called since at the time I had had two martinis.  The ambiance was super cool with the live piano player and singer at the bar. It really made for a spectacular birthday dinner. The service at Mastros was also amazing. I even received a phone call the next day from the restaurant asking how we enjoyed our dinner. Of course, I told them it was fabulous!
