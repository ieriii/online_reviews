Love Cafe 28. Great drinks (especially their caiprihinas), and an excellent blend of Cuban and Mexican dishes.  I have been there for dinner and brunch and both are fantastic. In the summer they have a nice little back patio as well. While writing this review I'm dreaming of their ropa vieja with those amazing plantains! The service has always been consistently good and they seem to deal with their huge wait well. If there is a long wait you can try to sit by the back bar... not many seats there either but you might get lucky.
