I was taken to dinner here by some students from the school I was interviewing at. As soon as I saw it from across Michigan Ave I knew it would be a carbon copy of the Cheesecake Factory. My guess was pretty darn accurate. The menu was extensive (and slightly overwhelming) and included a variety of styles of dishes. I went with the Indochine chicken and shrimp and enjoyed it. That being said, it still lacked the flavor punch I was looking for. Oh, and if you want fresh baked cookies for dessert, just be sure to order them with your entree.
