My hubby and I have been wanting to try Ethiopian food for the longest time. We are sooo sick of all the normal "nice" restaurants so we thought this would be a great way to start another wonderful year together. To make it ultra romantic we brought along our 5 month old daughter. We had such a great time. The food was really awesome we got the vegetarian/meat messob. The doro wat (chicken) was ok, the michetabish was awesome, the ye-siga wot was good, the ye-dnichena carrot alicha, ye-shimbra assa, and kik alicha were good. For the appetizer we had the beef sambussa which was delicious. For dessert we had the sambussa turnover which wasn't bad but it was probably my least favorite thing of the night. Overall, I loved the injera and eating with my hands. The server we had wasn't great and didn't really give us any suggestions or guidance otherwise I would give this place 5 stars. I will definitely be back!
