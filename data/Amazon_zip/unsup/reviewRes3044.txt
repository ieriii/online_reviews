CHICKEN WINGS!!! delicious! sassy wings and bbq! they are huge too! 3 girls ate 15 gigantic wings..burrrpppp. buddha bibimbap was good as well. lots of veges, beef, and nicely done sunny side up egg. add some kochujang and yum!!! huge portions as well. place gets packed very fast...but turnover rate is quick as well. walk across the street to bobtail ice cream for desserts...cute neighborhood to walk around too
