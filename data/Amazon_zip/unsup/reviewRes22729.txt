My wife and I had a great time here this evening and the only thing that kept Greek Islands from getting 5/5 stars was the fact that they were out of three differnet items that we wanted -- Their house wine (The white Nostros), the sea bass and finally Rice pudding. How can a Greek restaurant be out of Rice pudding at the 2nd seating of the night? (We were seated at 6:45pm.) For an appetizer we had the Dolmades, which were exquisite - lots of flavor, moist and tender. My wife, instead of the Sea Bass had the whole striped bass which was perfectly prepared and flavorful. I had the combo plate of moussaka and spanakopita. Both were incredible - the best versions I have had.
