Wow. I can say without hesitation that EVERYTHING I ate was worth eating. And I would eat every single item I ate again. No changes.  We started with salads (I had the mixed greens, and they were simple and perfect), and also an order of the shrimp and crab fritters, which are served with a lovely spicy sauce. Very good. I had the Erie Perch, and it was superb, and though you might not find the Perch on the menu every night, you will find a fish served with the luscious lemon butter, and I do not hesitate in recommending it. I also tried the potato-encrusted Grouper, and it was also absolutely fresh and delicious. Nice preparation. The table also had creamed spinach, mashed potatoes, and hash browns, and all of those items were great. My tastes run towards veggies, so I liked the spinach the best, but the mashed potato server was scraped clean by everyone else. And finally, our table shared an order of Alaskan King Crab legs, served chilled. Holy. Wow. I don't know how other crab legs are (this was my first taste!), but these were absolutely incredible. Ask for some melted butter for your table, even with the chilled legs, and you will not be sorry. I think I'm in love. After all that, there was no room for dessert, but I'm sure that it's handled expertly. I can't imagine it wouldn't be dynamite. Can't wait to go back!
