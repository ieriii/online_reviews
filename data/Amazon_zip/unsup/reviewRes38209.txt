Cause you're sweeter than apple pie Everything that you want you got Girl you know that you need to stop Most beautiful thing in sight...at GIORDANO's PIZZERIA! - Colby o' Donis (What you got) This is the very first thing we ate when we came to Chicago. It was on my list of places to try and it was conveniently located two blocks from our hotel. The waiting time for this place in the afternoon was crazy! They let you order your pizza before you even sit down (which is kinda neat because it saves you time since it takes 30 mins+ to make) but it didn't really seem like we saved much time because we probably waited for 45 mins+ on a non-weekend lunch and even after sitting, it took another 15 mins for the pizza to come. Either way, we couldn't wait for true chicago-style pizza and after the hour wait...it probably wasn't worth it. We were extremely hungry and if you're extremely hungry, almost anything tastes AT LEAST good. Maybe chicago pizza isn't my thing either, it has alot of cheese and you eat it like a pie. I do have to compliment the crust because it was delicious but i wish i found out how good it was by itself before the end of the meal. (towards the end when i was getting full i just pealed off the pie crust and ate that) All in all, its really filling and if you look around at the tables around you, almost no one finishes their pizza so whatever you think you'll be able to eat, order 1 size smaller than that and you'll be good. At least I got to say i've had chicago style pizza - you silly silly food. Food: 3 stars --- Service: 3 stars --- Atmosphere: 3 stars --- Price: 3.5 stars
