I don't understand why this restaurant has so many great reviews. The quality of their meat and seafood is terrible. I had the panang curry with chicken, tom yum soup with shrimp and spring rolls. The spring rolls tasted doughy and bland. I went with a large group and tried some of the beef dishes, which tasted off as well. I think Thai Valley on Kedzie or Spoon Thai are much better options for Thai in Lincoln Square.
