They have the best cocktails in the city, hands down. I am entertained by the prohibition theme and the dcor inside is gorgeous. I've been going there for years and they even make drinks that are off the menu now, you just have to ask. It's just an out there place that's hard to describe, but certainly worth trying. The only downside is the wait.
