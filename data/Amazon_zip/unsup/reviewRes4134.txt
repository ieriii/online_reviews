I know that the majority of the Yelp reviewers are thumbs up on Schwa, however, I don't share the same opinion/rating. The courses that I enjoyed were the beet risotto, quail egg ravioli and parsnip custard with candied sweetbreads. I felt that the dishes missed the mark; they tried to be creative by adding dollops of foam, a dribble of some concocted sauce or glaze, a shard or crispy curl of something such as candied peanut brittle, bits of chocolate in a savory dish, etc. but all of the tidbits of embellishments FAILED to make the main ingredient (which had no special preparation to speak of) in the dish stand out in anyway. To add insult to injury, they played rap music loudly the entire evening and with only 11 diners trying to have conversation in an acoustically challenged space, the "din" in the restaurant was extremely annoying! I'm a foodie from NYC and have dined in many 5 star restaurants to hole-in-the-walls to street vendors in search of good food and there is very good to fantastic food to be had at all price points. However, at Schwa, $55 for 3 courses or $110 for nine courses just isn't worth it; the food is different but far from being worth the tab.
