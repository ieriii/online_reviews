Loved this restuarant! Old-school cocktails with a twist, interesting and delicious menu offerings. Shared an appetizer, a side and the mussels. Even though I am not much of a beef eater, we had the marrow bones and bread for the appetizer...it looked like something out of the Flintstones but was fabulous! Beets served with cream fraiche and outstanding mussels! The best and biggest lemon meringue pie I have ever had. Will definitely recommend!
