So, first let me say I live a short walk from this place which definitely gives it extra cool points. One thing Logan Square has needed for a while (and seems to be finally getting) is options. So, let me say I had the Forest Burger, and it was so good! I ate it without the bun and it was filling, and delicious. I also had a side salad. Now, I had a side salad because I wanted something healthy and they have no veggie side which bummed me out a bit. But it was nice to have the salad as an option at least. Now, my friend had the Working Man Burger. However, the burger costs $10.00 for which he made the comment "what working man can afford this?" which I must say is not only witty, but also the damn truth! So, RevBrew is tasty With a great beer selection, And is in Logan Square, But with an ironic burger list with the basic burger price being $10.00. However, the burger was damn good! So, if you charge high and it's abso delish then I can still like you. 4 stars!
