This pizza here is delicious (this coming from a New Yorker who hates Chicago deep dish) but he ambiance SUCKED. I went on a Monday night with one friend and I had to scream across the table at her all through dinner. I was also bumping elbows with the strangers on both sides of me. I would give it 5 stars for take out but I wouldn't recommend it at all if you're and adult who just wants to have a casual dinner with a friend. It's the kind of place that frat boys would love.
