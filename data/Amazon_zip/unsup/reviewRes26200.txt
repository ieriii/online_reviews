the food here is really good, but what makes this a 5 star rating is the service. the owner and staff are genuinely the nicest people in the world. courteous, professional, kind, funny - i just wanted to chit chat with the staff all night. this is a gem of a place in a row of bars and restaurants that are riddled with loud, drunk college people. it's worth braving that scene to bring your own bottle of wine to this affordable, tasty spot.
