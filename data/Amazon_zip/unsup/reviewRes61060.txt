I was in the city Tuesday. A friend and I went to Wishbone for a late lunch. The staff was good,we didn't wait long. My friend had the burger and was very pleased with it. I on the other hand had salmon. Everything started well until I got to the center of the fish. It was still frozen!  I felt a little sick! Our waiter was very nice about it , he even took it off the bill. I think I will not go there for awhile!I have gone to the wishbone again,however I didn't find it very good.I had the salad and it wasn't very fresh.
