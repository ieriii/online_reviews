Excellent food both at this location and the Near North Side location. What can I recommend? Crepes! Strawberry orange juice! Eggs Benedict! The sausage links! So, why 4-stars and not 5 like the Near North Side location review I gave? In the sweltering summertime, this location gets HOT.Not like regular "oh we're cooking" restaurant hot, I mean we spent a good hour here and when we left it was cooler outside than it was inside the restaurant. I only really see this being a big deal in the summer, maybe in cooler times it is more of an asset. But, I would love to frequent this place more in the summer, so get cracking on this, Yolk! (heh heh heh)
