Delicious! I love this place for so many reasons! The atmosphere is very cozy and attracts everything from families to groups of friends to a date. Be prepared to eat a lot so make sure to wear comfortable clothes! The meal starts out with not only bread, butter, and oils, but also cheesy bread. Cheesy bread! Next off, is a choice of soup AND salad. When the meal finally comes, you're usually stuffed. I usually order a half order of manicotti, but have been meaning to go back again to try more dishes. I love this place and every time I have gone there I had a great time!
