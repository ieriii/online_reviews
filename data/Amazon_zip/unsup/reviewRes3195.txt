The BEST chicken wings in Chicago. The wings are huge and flavorful and of course "Crisp" I could eat here every week! I am not going to say everyday cause I am an obese whale so every week is go enough for me. So don't be an idiot go try Crisp but don't take my word for it that it'll change your life!!!
