It was just ok as far as pizza goes. The biggest disappointment was the crust. It didn't have any flavor, very bland. And I tend not to like places that cut their pizza in squares. Cutting it this way creates 4 weird tiny triangle pieces that consist of mostly crust and, if you are lucky, one bite of cheese and toppings. It also creates that one sloppy piece in the middle that no one wants and you can't pick up cuz it doesn't have a crust to hold on to. I've had better pizza and the atmosphere and waitstaff was only so-so.
