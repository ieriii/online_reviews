I love love LOVE by-the-slice deep dish. That pretty much means I could have one slice of nine different pizzas without having to buy nine different pizza pies. Uhh, absolute genius. Anyway, my friend and I stopped by here for lunch because my brother (who is as much a Chicago-style pizza enthusiast as I am) urged me to try it. Right off, I wasn't sure what to think because the slices looked a tad bit deformed . . . but upon trying a forkful each of the mushroom/spinach and the sausage/pepperoni, I realized that Art of Pizza is up there with the best of them. The crust has that deliciously light fresh-baked taste and is similar to another Chicago deep dish crust that I can't quite pinpoint; the sauce has a nice flavor; and the cheese is herby and generous without being overpoweringly thick and fatty. Mmmm. Good stuff.
