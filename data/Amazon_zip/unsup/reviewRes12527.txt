I was hoping for more from this Cuban joint. I was finally hoping for some awesome Cuban food in this city, but alas...Chicago doesn't have good Cuban food. I thought 90 miles would be good...wrong, terrible. And I thought this place had the potential to really stand-out - some extra props for decent presentation, but, in the end, it was just good, not great. The empanadas were good, and maybe I should've tried their congri - but I'm a little weary of wasting my money after all the crap black beans and rice I've had in this city. If there is one thing I miss about south Florida, it's the Cuban food. Ain't no better anywhere else. In fact, the supposed "best" places for Cuban here, can't touch the worst places in Miami. I don't why this is; there are Cubans that migrated up here, they should have taken their mamas recipes after they fled, and gone on to sizzling steak and simmering black beans like they were back home. I dunno, maybe I'm just having a run of bad luck EVERYWHERE. Anyone got a recommendation? A true-blood Cuban that knows of a whole in the wall place with the best congri, croquettas, etc in or around the city? Let me know, I will try it...and then probably destroy the place.
