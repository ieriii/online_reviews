Still some of the tastiest sushi ever, but not as great as its sister restaurant. So being in the south loop I am a religious eater at South Coast sushi. Friends north of the river brag that their Coast is better than the south coast because north is BYOB, south is standard full bar, wine, sake. Finally made it to the Coast and sampled their sushi. The selection did not seem as broad as South and many of my favorite friend rolls, were prepared differently than what i'm used to at south coast. That said the service, freshness of fish and layering of tastes still makes coast some of the best sushi ever. No matter if you're looking for fancy rolls that combine a bunch of fishes, flavors and textures, or super simple rice and fish....coast does NOT disappoint. My sashimi was so fresh and tasty, even ordered another round. the byob factor of here was very very nice i must say, and the crowd was pretty cool too.
