Who would of thought encased meat in a bun can get so exotic and intricate?!! Try everything, don't ask to exclude condiments or add condiments that they don't normally put on the dogs, and come HUNGRY. You'll want to try half the menu. Fridays and Saturdays are the best time to come for duck fat fries but also the worse because of the wait.
