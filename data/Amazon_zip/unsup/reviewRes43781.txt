UPDATE Alright...since having moved within a couple blocks of Milk & Honey, I must say that I do frequent it multiple times throughout the week, and it has grown on me. While the same old menu for sandwiches & brunch still disappoints (I like at least a little variety in my life), the pastries & desserts here are some of the best available on this side of town. Back when the pumpkin donuts were in season, they were at times, my reason for waking up in the morning. (Before you start thinking how sad it is that a donut could provide a reason for getting up, let me just say that these are the best donuts ever. My co-workers confirmed this.) --- I keep wanting to like this place more than I do. I guess there's enough decent things about it to keep me coming back, but I'm always hoping for more. Mostly what disappoints me is the brunch: the lack of options, the never-changing menu, the food itself. It's all fairly decent, but not really very good or interesting. I think I just want them to infuse their brunch menu with a bit of the creativity that their baked goods seem to have sometimes. Last time I went I had some type of spiced cinnamon pear bundt cake. This was the most redeeming part of the visit, it was tasty, and a bit unique. The coffee is always decent as well. Eh, you could certainly do worse.
