I've been here three times in a month since discovering it. The food is fabulous and reasonable. The decor is awesome, especially the backlit piece of art that looks like it's a portal to another dimension. The music is fun, the service is fantastic, and the owner is the Eastern European Michael Scott. You cannot go wrong with Little Bucharest!
