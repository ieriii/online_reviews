Great place, and I think the only place, for fast inexpensive middle-eastern food in Wicker Park. Make sure you know what you want before you get inline--the staff will be very nice about it, but not the people waiting behind you in line. The have a salad bar and carry middle-eastern grocery essentials. Outdoor seating is great when it's nice outside.
