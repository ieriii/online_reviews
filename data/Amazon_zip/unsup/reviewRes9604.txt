I took a client here for dinner. (A client I don't like all that much, but whatever.) Dinner and service were great. Our server was very helpful in helping our party find menu items that we would like, by asking a few questions. I really appreciated that. Unfortunately, I can't recall the dish I had. I just know it was good. And so was everyone else's dish!
