This is a small restaurant in Lakeview comprised of a narrow room with limited bench seating, colorful walls and plasma tvs (random). The staff is friendly and helped me choose a dish since I had never been there before. Apparently there's lots of good things to eat here, according to them, but I will definitely come back to try other dishes. I had a crispy chicken sandwich topped with tomatoes, spinach leaves, bacon and bleu cheese. It was great except the bad thing is that it was $8 and I probably could have eaten 3 of them. Side note: $10 credit card minimum so order big or get a drink.
