For once the hype is justified. Arrived here on Saturday for brunch without reservations. Fortunately for us the bar is full service so we went there. I had the lamb casserole while my friend had the Huevos motuleos. My lamb dish was tasty. You could taste all the individual ingredients which is quite rare.Didn't try the motuleos but the presentation was superb. Make sure you try the Margaritas. I usually find Margaritas too sweet but these were wonderfully balanced especially the tamarind version.
