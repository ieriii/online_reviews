Oh. Dear. Service was brutally slow. Bru. Tal. Food was just OK. We've actually been once before when service was slow (but not terribly) but the food was fantastic. The naan is great and the beer I ordered was huge, so that helped our party of 7 (including two 20-month olds) get through the night. And it was actually quite pricey, after all was said and done, given how much and of what we'd ordered. The mixed tandori, the vegetarian dinner, two veggie sides, some samosas and pakoras = $140. Hmmm..... I will say that the spinach pakora and spinach paneer with tamarind chutney was delish and I'm happy to have a few spoonfuls leftover for tomorrow's breakfast. Yes, indian food for breakfast. Even if it was overpriced and came slower than molasses in January.
