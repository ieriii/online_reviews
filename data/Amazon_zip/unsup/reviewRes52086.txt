This was my first Chicago deep dish pizza and it surpassed my expectations. I didn't get a chance to try any of the other famous deep dish places, so i cant really compare it to them but this pizza is LEGIT. We got the Meaty Legend and the Gino's East Supreme and both were awesome. The toppings, the sauce, the cheese... everything was amazing. I have been to some of the famous pizza places in New York and this deep dish pizza easily crushes those. Enjoy!
