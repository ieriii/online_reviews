Excellent dinner there recently. As last and late guests the service was superb. Complementary wasabi fries and plentiful green tea (amazing). The green tea reminded me of a fynbos flavor I've never had outside of the Western Cape of South Africa. I ordered the fried calamari and the yo la mango rolls of spiced salmon surrounded with fresh mango. I sampled the dragon rolls and was impressed by the fresh shrimp. For dessert, the chocolate molten, Heaven & Earth was adequate. The wait staff were patient and accommodating. I saw no overwhelming evidence of a too dark or ambient experience. I found the lighting calming and I like the partnership with Wang's and am curious about the business model. Enjoyable and highly recommended albeit pricey.
