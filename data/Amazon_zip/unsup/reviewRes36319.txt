I'm not a huge breakfast person but went here along with my friends. I liked the selection and thought they had really good fresh, tasty, well cooked food. I had the cinnamon apple crepes and a side of sausage. Very good! I didn't really care for the service, pretty snooty. I think since they all have accents that automatically makes them better than all of us, or so they want you to think :)
