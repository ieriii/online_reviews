I was disappointed in Crisp! It's been on my bookmark list for over a year so I had some high hopes. I ordered the combo for 2 people for takeout, with the full chicken of Crisp BBQ (this was good, not amazing) but the fries were soggy and vegetables were very vinegary and we threw them away. There are not many foods I don't like so was surprised at this. I would want to try something else, maybe a Buddha Bowl, if I went back because there are a lot of great reviews on here.
