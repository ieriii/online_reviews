Well, I was sure that I would never want to eat meat after visiting a Brazilian steak house. I was wrong, as soon as I had left I found myself asking "When will we meat again?". The salad bar hosted a variety of options, my favorites consisting of roasted baby beets, Manchego cheese and the soup de jour, Lobster Bisque. Of course, with this type of non-stop food fest one has to have strategy and prioritize. I tried my best not to overfill my platter with filler and focus on the main and many courses. The gauchos were not shy about keeping our table well stocked with goodies. My favorites included the house cut and the sirloin wrapped in bacon. I did spy some scallops wrapped in bacon, which I should have wrangled down, but I was happy with my fill of meats. Service was top of the line. Our waiter was efficient and friendly. Especially when my friend went to whip out of her 25% coupon (benefit of signing up on the email list) and her birth control flew out of her purse and landed on said waiter's feet. He was kind enough to pick up and make a witty comment as not to embarrass her.  A few other notables include one of the best Old Fashioned cocktails I've ever had, a wonderful atmosphere (bustling with meat and that wine sommelier acrobatics) and validated parking.
