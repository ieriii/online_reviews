When Mom comes to town, this is where we eat, whether I like it or not. The spring rolls are still the best ever, but last time I was there, I ordered this vegetable and fried noodle dish that was...not very great, hence the subtracted star. It didn't come home with me. Le sigh - if only they had more vegetarian options. This is just not the greatest place for a vegetarian, unless you want to eat curry (that's not quite as good as mine, sorry) or steamed veggies (yawn). I think the next time she comes to town, I'll eat a big enough lunch on my lone before venturing here with her.
