-Party of 4. -Hour & a half wait. -We sat at the bar while we waited. The drink selection here is excellent. Their beer selection here is more than ample. If you are a whiskey guy/gal, then this is THE spot. They must have a hundred different whiskeys here for $3 a shot. You can even order a whiskey flight. Besides drinking at the bar, we went ahead and started with an order of meatballs and an order of seared scallops. The meatballs were good but I gotta say the scallops were perfect...served with black truffle gnocchi and braised oxtail. By the time we were properly seated everyone knew what they wanted to order. I had consumed the following: -Roasted Marrow Bones -Lobster Parfait -Pork Belly Dinner The Roasted Marrow Bones were pretty huge...served with a red onion jam. They tasted good, but I probably would've rather had two orders of the Lobster Parfait instead because it was ALL KINDS OF AWESOME. Yes. Lobster Parfait. I know it sounds weird. That's because it is. It looked like some kind of pudding in a small martini glass with a piece of seafood sticking out of it. IT WAS AMAZING. Next time I won't share it. Don't judge me! I had the Pork Belly for my main entree. It was cooked perfectly. Although pork belly dishes tend to be extremely fatty in a good way, I felt as though this dish had an ample amount of "meat" in it considering what it was.  It doesn't look very big on the plate, but it definitely packs a punch and sits pretty heavy once consumed. In fact, I ate it last month and I still feel its presence. Cool atmosphere and very knowledgeable waitress. Great chocolate desert dish. Can't wait to come back.
