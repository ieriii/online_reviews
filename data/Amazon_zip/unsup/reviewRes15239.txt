What a great cocktail lounge. Drinks: Some of the best in the city. Price: All drinks are $12 Atmosphere: Great. Very dark. Almost to dark. Staff: Very nice and helpful. Came with a smile We went at about 8 p.m. on a Saturday and had to wait in line for about 30 minutes but it was worth it. Big star is across the street so we grabbed some tacos while waiting in line. The staff was very nice and helpful. The drinks tasted great! They are well worth $12 a drink. The Violet Hour is not at all stuffy but still very classy. The violet hour is a must go for everyone.
