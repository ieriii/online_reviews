I give this place 4.5 stars because although the food is great, this place is small and can get so crowded to the point that you have to shout at people in your own group at times. It's also quite common for everyone--including the wait staff and customers--to consistently bump into your table or chairs. Not exactly what i want to happen when I'm trying to eat dinner. I don't even need to detail what we ate, because everything I've ever ordered at either of the Francesca's locations has been spot on amazing. It's not adventurous dining by any means, it's just reliable, fresh, well prepared utterly delicious food. Solid 4.5 stars all around.Our appetizers (fried calamari - lightly breaded and fried perfectly so you could still admire the true fish taste; bruschetta - loved the variation and fresh bread) came quickly as did our entre's despite a packed house.No one was disappointed in their food.Word of advise make your dinner plans at 7:30pm cause after 8pm it gets CRAZY BUZY...
