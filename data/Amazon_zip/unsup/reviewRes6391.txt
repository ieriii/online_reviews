can't help but update... i keep coming back to this place! (helps that we live close by and can just walk here) i'm currently on a mission to find out all the ragu's of the day. So far I've tried pork shoulder (love), pork cheek (love) and prosciutto meatball (wasn't a fan of this one), one with artichoke (thought was a little too bland). The last time i was there, the waiter scooped the leftover polenta on our plates. THANK YOU! please keep doing this... otherwise i'll have to start asking you to leave the pot with me and that just makes me look like a huge fatty... i actually thought the cheese platter was a bit pricey and the slabs of cheese were pretty small in my opinion. My sisters were very disappointed that our bread was a raisin bread. They thought it destroyed the flavor of the cheeses. i don't normally eat just cheese so i'm no expert. the cheese tasted great but i'm just not sure it's worth it. (unless some of these cheeses are rare or hard to find?) there is a day where it's cheaper so go on that day! i'm trying not to RAVE about this place because some people have come here and thought it was overrated. I always like to go in a place and have no expectations despite the reviews. So please go in and form your own decision about davanti! =)
