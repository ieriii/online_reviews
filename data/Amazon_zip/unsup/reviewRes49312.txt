TERRIBLE. I went here w/ a friend and we had to get the manager due to the horrendous attitude of our waiter. (I later found out he was going through all these personal problems and had other complaints against him as a waiter). The manager was the ONLY saving grace about this place and she is no longer there. She offered to comp our meal, but we refused, we just wanted our food and some good service! I will say the food was good, but not worth putting up with the slow and rude service. I've had other friends go here and we all have the same story.
