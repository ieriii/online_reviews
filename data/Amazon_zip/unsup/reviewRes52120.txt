Gino's East serves one of the best deep dish pizzas in Chicago. I am never disappointed by the quality of the food, and was reminded again today how much I like it.  We ordered dinner here today since my wife just gave birth to our daughter and we were at Prentice Women's Hospital at Northwestern Memorial, which is conveniently located on the same block as Gino's East. The estimated time for carry out was 45 minutes, and for delivery it was 1 hour and 15 minutes -- so I decided to pick it up. I guess it was the extra 30 minute wait that made me get off my butt and pick it up. The restaurant was actually pretty crowded when I came to pick up my food. The cashier at the counter was pretty nice, and during the course of our conversation asked "was it a boy or girl?" I'm guessing there are lots of new dads that end up ordering Gino's East for carryout, since Prentice is right next door. Judging by the amount of Gino's East boxes in the communal fridge at the hospital, it seems like many people have done the same.  The pizza was delicious, just as I remembered it: extra saucy, generous amount of toppings, and wonderful butter crust. We ordered a large for four adults, and it was more than sufficient. We actually had two large slices left over. The bruchetta was just ok. The bread was extra crunchy, but the tomato topping was pretty good. The topping was just the right consistency: not too saucy and not too chunky. Overall, I continue to be pleased by the food at Gino's East, and when convenient I will eat here again.
