Irazu is one of my favorite restaurants in Chicago. I always get the same thing because it's so delicious-- the steak casado, which is steak and onions topped with a fried egg, with a nice vinegary cole slaw, rice and beans and plantains on the side. I also love the shakes-- I usually get mora, which is blackberry, made with milk. The place has a nice homey feel and it's family-run so you will see the same guy, Henry, at the cash register pretty much every time. The only bad thing is that sometimes there is a long wait since it was featured on Check Please a couple of years ago, but it's definitely worth it!
