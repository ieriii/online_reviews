One of the best and most fun meals I've ever had in Chicago. I'm not sure really what else I could say that the 600 previous patrons haven't already. I guess I'll try... Of course the beers are great. They're great because the higher alcohol content sneaks up on ya, and definitely makes it worth the price. This is the first restaurant where I've ever had a fresh oyster. We order the smaller platter for four people, as three of us were oyster virgins. It would so good that we immediately ordered another sampling! We tried so many things of the menu. It was one of the few times where I've gone to a restaurant and pretty much tasted everything I wanted. It was liberating to tell the waiter, "I want this, and this, and this, oh, and a side of this!" Personally, I'd say that the mussels were my favorite dish of the night. A HUGE caldron of fresh mussels in a delicious garlicky broth was absolutely worth the fair price. Other favorites of the evening was the pork belly, roast chicken, and oddly, the brussel sprouts. I don't tend to comment on restaurant "concepts" or atmosphere, but this place has a vision. I loved the pig pen booths, and even though the restaurant was bustling and filled with loud conversations, as soon as we were sat in our "pen" the only people I could hear were my lovely dining companions. The lighting is also really cool. I love the big ball lanterns, and whatever bulbs they used just casted the most warm and inviting glow throughout the space. I love it, and can't wait to come back someday!
