It is very rare when you can say that a place's food and beer are so good, they overshadow the inattentive service one might receive there. Granted, the table service is dependable. It's a few (not everybody) of the bartenders that are so in their own world, that they don't bother to look around to see if anybody needs anything. I have been there when the bar is empty and when the bar crowd is 5 thick, and received the same service. The Golden Arm brew and the pizza is so fricken good I am usually willing to put up with a bartender with their head in the clouds. It just seems so unnecessary to put up with, though, especially when you are tipping well and there is no reason for the slow service. Tonight, we had a table and we were tactfully asked if we would move to the bar to free up the table (of course) and the person in charge offered us a round of beers for our inconvenience, which the bartender was never informed of and we never received. Over all, a restructure of customer service here would up its star potential straight to a 5.
