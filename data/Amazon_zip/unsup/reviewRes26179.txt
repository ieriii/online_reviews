Dropped by for a late lunch with a friend. The owner seated us and took our order. Incredibly friendly and charismatic guy! Both of us ordered the beef pho and it was delicious. Not as good as my stops on Argyle, but definitely up there. The vibe was very chill and relaxing, but the music was pretty cheesy sounding (wasn't a problem) - my friend said it's the standard Vietnamese karaoke-type stuff. The ambience would make for a good date. I was given a limeade on the house for whatever reason. It was great! Not too sweet at all and very refreshing. I'd normally give this a 3 and a 1/2, but this is the only Vietnamese place I know of in the Lincoln Park area, so it gets an extra half star for convenience! Definitely going back to try their Banh Mi and other lunch specials (they go until 3PM)
