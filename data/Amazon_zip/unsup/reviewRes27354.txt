I think everything that has to be said about this pizza has already been said. But I'll say it again because why not? I love the taste of the caramelized crust. I love the sauce the cheese, etc. This is my favorite "deep dish" place in the city right now. But I am far from a pizza expert. I really enjoy that this pizza reheats well as most deep dish pizzas do but this one seems to reheat better than others. There's usually a good beer deal going on here while dining in. This is my pizza of first resort in the Lincoln Park area.
