Great selection of beers. None of the domestic trash like Bud or Miller. Mostly fine imports that actually taste like beer. Great atmosphere, like an English pub. Cozy, but it can get cramped. Worth the drive to the northside, a good place to hang out and spend a nice evening with a friend. They keep the music pretty low so you can actually talk. So if you're a big fan of beer and want to try some of the best in the world, come here for the evening.
