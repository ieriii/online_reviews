As if you haven't heard, Sabatino's is old school and the atmosphere will take you back to what Italian restaurants used to be. I remember coming to this place a few times in the early 90's. As a nearly life-long Northsider, Old Irving Park wasn't an area that I was familiar with and the name never stuck with me. I did remembered that the food was awesome, the portions were huge, and the prices were reasonable. I didn't stay friends with the group that took me here, so I often wondered what the name of that awesome Italian place was called. Fast forward 10 years later when I moved to the Old Irving Park area. I was feeling like Italian food one particular evening and headed over to Sabatino's. As soon as I walked in the door, everything looked so familiar! As I took a few more steps into the dining room, it dawned on me this was THAT Italian restaurant that I remembered so fondly of! Everything looked the same, from the piano at the entrance, to the smoke-filled bars, to the crowded dining room. I was very excited to try Sabatino's once again. Everything was as I expected food wise - The complimentary loaves of bread & pizza bread, the soup & salad that came with your entree, and of course the huge plate of delicious food that I remembered so fondly. I was in heaven, and so so happy that I've found Sabatino's once again. For the past 6 years, I have recommended and taken friends & family to this wonderful establishment. They all rave about the old school feel and the awesome food. I'm sure they have passed on the recommendations as well. I hope they never change, especially the decor and the feel of the restaurant. Bottom line: If you want some old school Italian dining experience, I cannot recommend Sabatino's enough! Reservations are highly recommended, even on a weeknight for two. Expect your table to be filled with food and endless courses, and a doggie bag to take home.
