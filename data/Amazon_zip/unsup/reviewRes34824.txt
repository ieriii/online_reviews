Perhaps it's merely a fondly remembered youth, but Sultan's as of late has been experiencing declining quality. Although it's still uber-quick, cheap, and decent, it's not as good as it used to be. The falafel always tastes a little stale, as do the zatars and spinach pies. The lentils and rice and the other sides seem not as well seasoned. It's still a nice place to grab a quick bite on the cheap, the inside is beautiful, and the patio in the summer is great, just not what it once was.
