Went for a business lunch with a group of 6 people. We ended up going during restaurant week so we were able to get a three course Prix Fixe menu for $22. Ambiance was very cool and hip, and the place was buzzing with energy. Definitely seems like a happening lunch spot: The three courses were: - Celery Root Pure soup: amazing! - BBQ Duck Confit sandwich: huge massive sandwich that was difficult to eat, but it rocked my world. Excellent! - Fritters: deep fried dough. Powdered sugar. 'Nuff said. Overall I was impressed with The Gage, and I will definitely go back in the future!
