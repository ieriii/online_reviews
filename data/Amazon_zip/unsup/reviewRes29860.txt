Third time at my favorite Rick Bayless establishment. Went on a weeknight, around 6:00 pm with some co-workers. The wait wasn't bad at all considering a helpful waiter pointed out a newly opened table off of the bar, where we were able to get appetizers and drinks before dinner. The guacamole and homemade tortilla chips were wonderful, and the wait staff was incredibly helpful to my gluten-free companion. Several staff approached her throughout the evening to be sure she was ok and didn't have any concerns about her food choices. Education is key for gluten-free dining and Frontera staff are definitely well-educated on this food allergy.  Our cocktails were great, and my companions really loved the specialty holiday cocktail. I'm not that sweet of a gal and opted for a more-standard margarita option. I wasn't disappointed.  The food at dinner was wonderful. I had the enchiladas de mole. The mole here is by far my favorite. Just the right amount of sweet and spice. Very tasty. While perusing the menu we were pleasantly surprised to have the wine expert stop by and offer suggestions. The place was busy but she was still making the rounds and offering suggestions based on our meal choices. No disappointments there either. Food and drink were great and I'll definitely be back again.
