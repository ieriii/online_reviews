Had the crispy pork belly & the hubby had the brisket for lunch. So hard to choose, many tempting dishes on the menu. Asked the waiter for a red wine glass recommendation & the Lou was an excellent choice. Rolled out of there pleasantly satiated & wondering if we can make it back before we leave town for the fish & chips!
