I actually came here in a winter day..but ofcourse came early...and waited a bit in line...Doug took our order just like on TV...lol...haha I must admit I was somewhat excited lol...the hotdogs where good...but I was expecting more...I tasted the duck fat fries and I didn't like them that much..I love fries and I know their greasy but these fries I could actually taste alllll the grease...I will come again just for the thrill of standinbg in line for a hotdog lol...I know sounds silly...but I just love hotdogs!
