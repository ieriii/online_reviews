We dined at LB on the night after the blizzard, nobody was out and about, but they were open. We were alone in the restaurant, so probably not your typical review. (Obviously had very attentive service!) But what is really noteworthy, and why I'm typing, is the FOOD! It was really delicious! I didn't know what to expect, and they do have a great and pretty diverse menu. We had charcuterie plate, a beet salad, and the eggplant spread appetizers. They were all really delicious. My hubz had the ghoulash, which was a surprise (we're used to the soupy/stewier ghoulash) in that it was more like "deconstructed ghoulash." Short ribs that were almost melt-in-your-mouth tender, and what a delicious flavor, totally came together so well! I had chicken schnitzle with spaetzle, and it was also delicious, tender but with a very light breading that had a perfect bit of crunch. It's a total gem. They have several vegetarian-friendly appetizers, salads and entrees.....including a vegetarian ghoulash which I'm dying to try out next time. PS, we gorged ourselves and were stuffed, but it wasn't that "I ate boatloads of heavy rich Eastern European food" kind of stuffed but rather, we just wanted to try as many things as we could. And we did. And we loved them all. Be prepared to jam to some serious Romanian or Euro-pan pipe and violin music, go with it. You are probably long overdue for your Zamfir injection. Go there. Now. Seriously, get up and go.
