After eating at places in the SF Bay Area that claim to serve "Chicago-style deep dish" I realized that I've never actually tasted REAL Chicago deep dish pizza until coming here. The atmosphere is great. I love how the walls are all covered with graffiti even in the restroom. I ended up sitting on the toilet longer than I intended because I got caught up reading all the writing on the wall!
