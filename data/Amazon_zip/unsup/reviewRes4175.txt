One of the most unique meals in Chicago. The term 'foodie' is so over-used I just barfed in my mouth writing it, but people who are serious about food will love this place and people who just want a good meal will too. Just remember the chef and cooks are drunk or stoned and they only do tasting menus (3 or 9 courses plus random food surprises along the way). It's well worth the hassle of trying to get a reservation. I wouldn't call it an ideal date place (but it's a good place to say you've eaten while on a date somewhere else!).
