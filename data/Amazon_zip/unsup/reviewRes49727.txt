I went to Las Tablas last weekend as a replacement for Tango Sur. We made a reservation a week ahead of time, and when we go there they had no record of it. Good thing we got there 20min before the reservation due to the fact groups of 6, and 15 were behind us and also had reservations that were not recorded anywhere.  Once we were seated everything was allright. I don't think the food was the best I have ever had, but it definitely wasn't bad either. I felt the chicken was better than the steak, and having come for the steak that was a little disappointing. It is a BYOB, which is great, just so you know the corkage fee per bottle is either $3 or $3.50, and the same for a 6-pack of beer. Definitely look at possibly splitting dishes if you don't want to take leftovers you get a lot of food for the price. Also expect it to be loud in there. A lot of people go with groups of people, so it gets loud very easily."
