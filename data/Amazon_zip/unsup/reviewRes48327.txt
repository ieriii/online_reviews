What does it say about me if I tell you that the two most memorable things of my experience at The Publican were: - the bathroom soap - a Belgian waffle That I am difficult? picky? insane? uneducated? prissy? Paul Kahn's enemy? a French spy? awful to offal? Nah. Or maybe a bit of each. Whatever. But mostly - it screams that after having tasted paradise on a plate several times in another establishment a couple of blocks south I was expecting better. Clearly, le "cochon" has lost the battle against la "chevre". Poor little piggy. The second edition of our Sunday night supper club (nothing to do with Wisconsin, it's just a name) took us on Green Street, and we were all excited about it. But at the end of the meal we all agreed that, well, it wasn't that exciting after all. We did a good job of sharing a multitude of dishes though, and were really open-minded and ready to be blown away. It just didn't happen. The sardines were blah, the crudo lacked in acidity, the eggplant had nothing to them, the porchetta was slightly undercooked and dry at the same time, the pig ears tasted like bacon, and overall the presentation was just.........sloppy. I enjoyed the peaches though - deliciously tart - the ribs and the buttermilk dressing on the little gem salad. And my seasonal Three Floyds. Poor harvest. The dessert waffle was outstanding. Just like I remember it from home. Crunchy and soft, with a delicious blackberry jam. I could order 10 of them. And the soap.....I couldn't stop smelling my hands. Bigelow Village Perfumer Body Lotion Lime & Coriander, you have a new fan, soon customer. I am pretty sure that the kitchen has nothing to do with it though. Maybe I have been too spoiled but The Publican didn't quite do it for me. I am still planning on coming back for (over-priced) oysters and waffles. And beer. Naturlisch.
