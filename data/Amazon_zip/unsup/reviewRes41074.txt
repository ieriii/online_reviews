Once again, on my first trip to Chicago i had enormous expectations for this place--as Capital Grille the night before let me down. The bread offering relative to Cap Grille is poor..and the ambiance probably isnt as good. We ordered the crab cake entree and ribeye with 2 sides not worthy enough to remember. The crab cake were not bad..but perhaps im just not a fan of crab like i thought i was. The ribeye looked great..but seemed way under seasoned..iv had better Choice meat for 1/2 the price. The service was pretty good. All in all, not worth the $107...good bye 1/4 of a month's grocery budget...100% of the gas budget..etc
