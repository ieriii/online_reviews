Love Rick and the lengths he goes thru to serve quality food and drink. Great Mexican inspired food with beautiful flavors meshed well together. Loved the tortas but not crazy about the hard bread. Also tried the huevos rancheros but I think the ones at Nuevo Leon has him beat. Great the craft beer selection. Pricey but worth it for the quality of the food. Only 4stars for the effort but could easily turn to 5.
