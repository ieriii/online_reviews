Where love of pizza + love of beer = heaven.  Having sampled the beer at the Green City BBQ over the summer, my other half and I had been dying to actually come in here and sample some more. Luckily, with a friend in town from Ohio staying nearby, we finally had an excuse!  The pizza (we got a plain with banana peppers, italian sausage and green peppers) was probably some of the best I've ever had. Fresh, FRESH ingredients, some spice, some garlicky goodness in the sauce. . . . mmmmmmmmmm.  We nearly finished off a whole large pizza, just the three of us. As for the beer? You don't have to sell me on this. I love beer. The beer here is GOOD. Trust me. GOOD. We tried the Full Frontal, the Worrin' Ale, the Golden Arm and the Dark-n-Curvy. And all were delish. We will definitely be back. Atmosphere is great, service friendly and fast. I can't wait for more out-of-towners to visit so we can bring them here and show em how it's REALLY done!
