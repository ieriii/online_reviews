We were "those" people. After chatting over coffee at the Wormhole a few doors down, my girlfriends and I walked in at 2:10pm on a Thursday. Oops, they close at 2:30pm. With that being said we never felt rushed throughout our meal. Water kept getting refilled. Our server would come by every now and then to check up on us.  I went with the smoked turkey club that was stuffed with some of my favorites: bacon, avocado, spinach, tomato, havarti cheese & sundried tomato mayonnaise. I could barely fit my generously stacked sammie my mouth. My side of hashbrowns were a bit over seasoned with pepper & oregano, but hey, who needs more carbs anyways, right?!
