So, my brother and his home girl bring some Hot Doug's back to the house. 4 different dogs (Foie Gras, The Dog, Elk, Spicy Jamaican Jerk) and our home girl got a corn dog (lol). They also brought home the duck fat fries. They waited in the line for 2 hours and they brought this home? $40 tab? The hype killed my experience probably. I expected a lot more. The over hyped fries tasted like Suzy's fries (for all who know Suzie's the-Grease-Pit on Elston, knows this is not a good thing). The best dog out of the bunch we ordered was The Dog, regular Chicago style hotdog. Would I go again, maybe. Maybe, I have to eat it fresh - but for now - I think Maxwell Street still has my dog of choice - and I can buy 6 pairs of socks from the street "vendors" during my visit to Maxwell. My brother liked it and he's a tough food critic, so maybe I am missing something...
