I went here ages ago, before I knew that it was "the cool" thing in Wicker Park. I came with a bunch of older work people into a shady area with a crazy door that i no idea was there. This place seemed really fancy, but we sat down very intimately in a booth with a great server. She seemed like she would be pretentious, but she wasn't at all. There were a lot of neat drinks on the menu, and I got one with absinthe. This was a year ago, so pardon my memory. The drinks were expensive, but that is what you get. The crowd was surprisingly casual (jeans allowed) I will have to come here again on other circumstances.
