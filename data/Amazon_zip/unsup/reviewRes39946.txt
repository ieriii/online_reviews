I've been here several times and honestly, it's not one of those places where I say "ooh, let's go back!" I only really head there when a huge group of (hungry) friends wanna go. The food is abundant, but nothing special, in my opinion. However, their onion pancake is to die for. I'd go back solely for that. :)
