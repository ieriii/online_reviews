If you are a BBQ afficianado, you have to come here. The chef is Lee Ann Whippen, who has been a big winner on the BBQ competition circuit, as well as many appearances on TV. The cost is high, but I've cooked competition with Wagyu beef, and it is expensive, so I'll give them a break on this part. Also, the restaurant is fancy for BBQ, with a very attentive staff and polished kitchen and dining room. The sliced brisket had excellent mild smoke flavor, and good bark on it. From a competition point of view, it was a little underdone (slightly tough), and a little dry, but perfectly acceptable for restaurant level. The cole slaw was a huge pile and was good, but not exceptional. There was enough cole slaw for 3 people. The pork ribs were very tasty, although slightly overdone and came off the bone too easily. The rub used for the ribs was spicy and was outstanding. These were not the competition ribs, but were very good. There are 4 sauces to choose from, and my favorite was a Kansas City style with red pepper flakes in it. I generally prefer a Texas red, but this was excellent, and not too sweet. The other sauces were good, but I didn't use them much. I thoroughly enjoyed the BBQ meat, but I have to say the star of the show was the pickle appetizer! They were large, crinkle cut slices, that were marinated in a sweet/sour mixture with peppers added. They were fantastic. I ate the whole bowl myself. Enjoy.
