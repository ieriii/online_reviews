There are only two bad things to say about Hopleaf. One, it isn't across the street from me. Two, their vast beer list makes nearly all other bars appear inferior.  You needn't be intimidated when you see the crowd up front. There's quite a bit of seating in back, upstairs, and even outside during the warmer months. This doesn't mean you'll get a table right away, but it's not Kuma's.  An added bonus for the germophobes: Xlerator hand dryers in the restrooms. Anyone who's ever thought about walking out of a public restroom without soaping up will change their mind when they see one of these beauties. It's like drying your hands with a jet engine.  If the beer and restroom accessories aren't enough, the food here is pretty damn good as well. But if you overdo it on the potent Belgian brews, any fare will seem more than satisfactory.
