I went here for brunch a few weeks ago. It was hard to make a decision on what to order, since so many things looked great. I settled on the Eggs Romero (poached eggs, potato cakes, pulled pork with a bbq sauce). I never finish my food, but forced myself to eat all of this. I didn't want to leave anything on my plate because it was so good. The sauce was nice and tangy, not sweet.  I can't wait to go back to try their dinner.
