I'm in love! I prefer savory crepes but I've tried the dessert ones too. I'd recommend ditching the crepe if you are ordering the savory and getting it "salad style", at least for the "create your own". Its so large that it ends up like a giant burrito and is hard to eat. My favorite is the create your own, Icosium dressing, chicken, avocado, mozzarella (I love goat cheese but the combo is too mushy together) with pine nuts and arugula, YUM! I also love to go for the house organic kafe and the vegetable soup. One request, please start delivery at this location!
