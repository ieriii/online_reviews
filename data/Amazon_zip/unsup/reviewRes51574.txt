This is a nice local Mexican sit down restaurant. They have a bar too which is important for Mexican cuisine. They basically serve the standard Mexican fair and the food is consistently good. They recently redid the front exterior and it looks really nice.  There's also another Garcia's on Lawrence. I think it's the same owners that's not as nice. The service is also really good and authentic. A nice stable in Lincoln Square. It's been in the area long before many of the other shops and restaurants. The fact that it's been there so long is a true testament.
