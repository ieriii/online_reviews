My companion and I split the spinach eggs benedict and the salmon eggs benedict. It was a rather epic New Year's Day breakfast. Way too much eggs benedict, but they were both wonderful. Super cool place in a great neighborhood. Their latte could be better, and for some reason they serve it in a glass, making it too hot to hold. Be prepared to wait 30 minutes to an hour (depending on your party size), but it's well worth it.
