after a shaky start (we were completely overwhelmed by our servers menu/wine/etc/etc/etc explanation that lasted several confusing minutes), davanti enoteca lived up to the hype. lovely warm & welcoming atmosphere, interesting wine menu displayed on a giant bottle, great vino prices, good menu variety, delicious food, friendly manager, and dessert on the house...what more could you ask for? we shared a communal table, enjoyed the farm-y (aka home for me) decor, and marvelled at all the adorable mini mason jars on our table and displayed around the place. all the dishes were delicious and easy enough to share. i would definitely go with people you know, who aren't afraid of your germs and won't smack your hand away from "their" plate!  do not skip dessert - we were lucky enough to be presented with 3 options to try. all were amazingly delicious and all were amazingly different! i can't wait to enjoy the grape sorbet on a hot day on taylor...summer 2011 - here's to you!
