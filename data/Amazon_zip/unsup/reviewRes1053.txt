Doug always seems happy and ready to joke around with you, even as a 2 hour long line of customers is waiting, he never looks hurried or panicked. If he rushed people through he could probably make more money, or if he raised prices, stayed open later, etc. Doug doesn't seem concerned about maximizing profits. Actually, Doug doesn't seem concerned about anything aside from encased meats. I worry about him.
