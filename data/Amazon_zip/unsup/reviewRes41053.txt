We are moving around the corner from Bon Soiree, so when I read the reviews and heard about the underground dinners, we decided to go the next night. We were nothing short of elated at the food and service we received. Between the two of us, we started out with an asparagus and mushroom salad and red lentils with creme fraiche on a corn cake (the lentils and corn cake was simple and fantastic). We then went on to the stupendous rack of lamb with fingerling potatoes and Grand Mariner glazed salmon with Portobellas. We finished with the bread pudding and chocolate mousse. The meal was fantastic. I felt that the place was barren as compared to other restaurants who could not sniff the quality of the food of Bonsoiree. Good thing that we are moving close by, we will be happy to go more often.
