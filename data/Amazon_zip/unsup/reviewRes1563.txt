It's undeniable. Hot Doug's cannot be beat in the game of encased meats. The epic lines make that obvious. If at all possible, try to go early on a weekday. The line is more bearable then. But even if you have to wait forever, the dogs are worth it. Suck it up, you won't be sorry. The specials are a thing of beauty. I ordered the smoked shrimp and pork sausage topped with a Cajun remoulade and huge chunks of blue cheese. Spicy, creamy, out of this world. And the foie-topped duck sausage is probably the most insanely decadent thing you could ever put in your body. And if that's not enough for you, the people who work here are the friendliest damn people I have ever encountered in the food industry. That's it. I'm moving to Chicago.
