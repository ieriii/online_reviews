I finally made my way back here Saturday night, and had a lovely time. Service was still great, the food was pretty good, and I had one glass too many of prosecco (is that even possible?). Right now they are celebrating their anniversary, so they have specials that change every month. June's was a $7 burger and it was super yummy. If July's special is equally as good, I will be making my way back here. They didn't seem to be busy at all on a Saturday night, which surprised me, but that means you likely won't have a problem getting a table. It really is the perfect place to just relax with friends, and it's convenient to all public transit. That makes it a win in my book.
