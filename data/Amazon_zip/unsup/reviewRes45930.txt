Not sure why, but every time I come to this place something goes wrong. First few times, managers took care of the issues then some. Lately my visits result in puzzlingly bad experiences. For example this one. So my friend and I come for lunch and get into usually long time, Metr'D gives you a vibrator and you wait .... noticing all people that walk in and get their vibrators after you .... and being called before you .... So I come to the Metr'D and ask if there is a problem with our vibrator because a few groups went in before us ... "No, no problem," she responds, "I'll call you next." Ok .... right? .. and a few more groups are being called in front of your eyes. Now this is service!
