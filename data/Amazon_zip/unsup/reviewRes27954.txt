Our party of 3 ordered the "Experience" tasting menu consisting of 11 courses. It was awful, each course was a confusing array of flavors that did not blend well at all. It honestly felt like torture after the 3rd course, all 3 of us just wanted this experience to end. The curry soup was the worst of all, first they brought the ingredients on the plate and then dumped the actual liquid soup from a beaker into your plate making a butchery of the flavors. Almost all of the dishes were too salty and they used too much pures and sauces smeared on the plate. They even managed to ruin the wagyu course, they bought a nice arrangement only to be bathed by another liquid concoction that was poured onto the dish to flood the delicate meat. I can't even remember the rest. It was a waste of 3 hours and $500. Never trust the hype. Skip this place and go to Boka instead.
