It's a nice looking hotel, but the rooms are small and the bathroom is tiny...The location is great if you're wanting to check out the sites downtown as it's only a short walk or cab ride to quite a few attractions if you're from out of town. It's a little pricey but what can you expect when you're downtown at the W.  I was disappointed that when we checked in our room wasn't ready and that was after 4pm. We had to take a walk and eat lunch before the room was ready so almost an hour went by before we could actually go to the room.  Another disappointment was the view. Lovely rooftop. =)
