Yom Yom Yom....sooo GOOOD! My friend and I live in the area and we finally decided to try the wings here (and we are so glad we did). The guy taking our order was really nice to us as we took almost 17 minutes to decide on our order...(no one was in line). We decided on the Seoul sauce wings and he offered to give us a free wings basket if we could finish the one we ordered. Boy were these wings good, they were so different from anything I have ever tried. My friend and I look tiny but we can handle a lot of food so he was definitely surprised that we went back for our free basket. I'm not a big fan of fried food but I crave these wings and ever since I have been going back for more.
