I agree with Laura K about the sweet/savory debate - although if you had to choose go savory. The BLT eggs benedict might be the best meal I've had in Chicago - and I've gotten it multiple times so it is consistently amazing.  The service here is great - but the waits are insanely long. Winter, Summer, it doesn't matter there is always at least an hour wait on weekends. There are plenty of stores and coffee places around to walk in while you wait so it isn't too bad.
