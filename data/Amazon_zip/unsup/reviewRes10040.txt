My first experience with Piccolo Sogno was wonderful. It was winter, I ordered the Pizza Bianca con Rucola, and the food was was delicious. My second experience involved an extraordinarily hot evening. Despite the heat, even the outdoor space (which is the real draw, here; seriously, it's gorgeous) was packed. That said, there was a wait for our food. I'm talking 55 minute wait for an order comprised of gnocchi and a pizza. To bide our time, we ordered the mixed olives, however the olives were terrible, yo'. As in Nancy Reagan, "Just say, "No!"" The only thing worse to have served us would have, perhaps, been a can of black olives...or a tennis shoe. Finally, our gnocchi and pizza were at long last served to us without an offer of freshly ground pepper or parmesan.  Oh, and my pasta was bland on account of a dull tomato sauce. In short, I think the service during the cold weather months far surpasses the service in the summer months. During the former, there are just fewer customers and plates to prepare and I think that the kitchen can focus more on the food, and the waitstaff on the service. Still, go in the summer for the lovely outdoor seating under the trees strung with cafe lights. The ambiance may (or may not) distract you from the food. In the winter, go for a wonderful meal in a cozy setting.
