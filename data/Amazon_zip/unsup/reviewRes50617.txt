It's a wonderful feeling when the waitress says it'll be a decently long wait, then two minutes later they're bringing you to your table. It's a pretty big place, so I feel like that wasn't a one time occurrence. I know I ate here years ago when I was little, but I have no memory of what I ate, but I was a little disappointed this time. We shared the spinach omelet (with potatoes and a biscuit) and corn cakes with bacon. The spinach omelet was pretty good, it's nice that you can choose which cheese you like, but it wasn't anything you couldn't find elsewhere. The potatoes were wonderful, perfectly crisp, and cooked with onion and garlic. The biscuit was terrible. Really, I can't say anything more about it than that. The corn cakes... Well, the corn cakes I'm used to are a little sweet. These had a sweetness to them, but they were a much more savory dish. They contained green onions and actual pieces of corn, which was pretty confusing to me, and I couldn't eat more than a bite of it. I could definitely see how some would love it, it's just not my taste. I also ordered the Mississippi Mud, which they claim is the best Thai Iced Coffee in Chicago, but I'm convinced that whoever decided that had never had Thai iced coffee. This was a very diluted, barely sweet drink that only faintly reminded me of coffee, where everywhere I've had Thai iced coffee, it's quite sweet, and very obviously... coffee. I might come back to try lunch or dinner, but I don't have much of a desire to return for breakfast.
