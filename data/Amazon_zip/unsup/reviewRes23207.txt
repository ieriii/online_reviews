Disclaimer: I am not a huge fan of Greek food, so I went in with really low expectations.  Service: Not terribly great. We made reservations and had to wait 5-10 minutes before we were seated, even though the restaurant was not crowded. The server also splashed oil on my friend's WHITE SHIRT when he was clearing the dishes.  Food: We tried a bunch of appetizers - the meatballs tasted fresh (but nothing spectacular). Everything was okay. I got calamari, which was okay. All the dishes are HUGE. How can anyone finish their food?? We didn't even go for dessert because my friend was trying to get the oil out of her shirt.  The one cool dish was this flaming cheese appetizer. That was the highlight of the meal. I am partly biased because I just don't like Greek food (I came because everyone else voted for it), but given the service and quality of food, I wouldn't recommend this place.
