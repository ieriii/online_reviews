This was the very first pizza place we tried when we moved to Chicago almost 2 years ago, because it was close by. We knew at the time that it was good. We just didn't know how good. Over the last 2 years we have tried all the highly recommended big name pizza places in the city yet we still come back to Art of Pizza.
