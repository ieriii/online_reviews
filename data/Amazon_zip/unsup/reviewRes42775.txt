I had such an amazing experience here. To start with out server was amazing. I wish so much I could remember her name so I could hand out a personal compliment but I do remember her boyfriend was the one that prepared the bone marrow. We started with cocktail and mine was great. Not too sweet not too strong. We ordered a few things and shared. Started with teh bone marrow, this is a must. It's cut long ways which is apparently very rare and it is just amazing. Comes with a carmalized onion jam that is to die for.  Also had the pork belly (so tender and amazing), balckened cauliflower, truffle & mushroom pasta, shrimp cocktail, and the cornbread.  These were all 5 star, no joke. Theres not one thing that I wouldnt want to order again if I went. We ended the meal with teh date cake that just melted in my mouth. Im on a high as I write this review 4 days later. I highly recommend this place, a great place for a date or girlfriends dinner. We followed up cocktails with house wine. We each had three drinks total (3 of us) and the total bill with tip was $200, totally worth it.
