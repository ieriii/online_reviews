I've been here for business lunches, business dinners, dinner with friends, drinks etc. Love their sushi, including rolls and sashimi. It's all so fresh. Their black miso cod is excellent. The atmosphere is trendy, and it's good before a night out. There is a small bar at the front where you can sit and have wine and sushi.
