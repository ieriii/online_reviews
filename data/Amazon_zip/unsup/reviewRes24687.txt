Ordered takeout from here for lunch a few months ago after hearing how good it was. Wasn't overly impressed. I got the turkey melinzana (turkey) sandwich which was good--the bread was a bit tough for my taste. My husband ordered the Mediterraneo (lamb) sandwich, which he liked but didn't love. Both sandwiches came with pasta salad which unfortunately upset both our stomachs hours after eating. I did however LOVE the bakery items. I felt like a kid in a candy store trying to decide of what to get- the choices are endless! I settled on the pecan baklava, which was TOO DIE FOR! Also tried the carrot cake which was delicious. I would definitley go back for the baked goods-- that is clearly their strong point.
