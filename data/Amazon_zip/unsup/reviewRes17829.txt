I disagree with many of the glowing reviews of this place. We went there on a Sat. night for a 7:30 reservation, and although we were only 5 min late, they handed us one of those huge blinking pagers (a la Cheesecake Factory!) and we were made to wait for over a half an hour. The "hostess stand" is more like a front desk at a hotel, and because it was crowded and no one knew quite where to stand or check in, it was a mess and no one was there to assist people coming in. The space of this restaurant is intended to keep with the drama and overabundance of the theme of Carnivale, but we found the space way too big, noisy, and it felt too much like grand central station. Perhaps if we were seated in one of the side rooms it would have been better, but the main dining room lacks any intimacy or atmosphere. That said, the service was adequate and attentive and the food was delicious. I had the ceveche trio and then the ahi tuna entree and both were wonderful. The crowd in this place was a strange mix of trashy hip and just plain trashy - right next to us we had a table of eight of what must have been a stripper convention - it was like a car wreck, you could not look away! Although it was pretty entertaining, this place definitely was more pretentious than classy, and I probably would not go back. Although the food is good, it's by no means a bargain, and the same could be had at Nacional 27 in a much better atmosphere.
