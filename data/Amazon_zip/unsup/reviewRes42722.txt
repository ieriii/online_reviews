Today was my second time ordering Art of Pizza delivery. Both times the pizza came later than promised but I know it takes a long time to make a good stuffed pizza. I expected it to be longer than the person at AoP promised. That last star is missing because the delivery manager could just tell it straight for those people who expect things when promised. Let's move on to the food. This pizza is AMAZING! I believe that there is a sort of crust on the surface of the pizza that is buttery, melty and adds that element of mysterious deliciousness or je ne sais quois. Additionally, the sauce is phenomenal. It is red, fresh, and robustly flavorful. The crust on the bottom is akin to Lou Malnatti's however I think it is better: same texture, better flavor and less greasy. 5 stars for sure! The salad was mediocre at best, but again, this was as much as I expected from a pizza joint. The cherry tomatoes were a nice touch. The last thing I want in my mediocre ice berg salad is wedges of flavorless pale tomatoes. There were a lot of veggies other than the lettuce and that was a good thing. If I were making this salad, I would definitely slice the celery instead of just throwing in half a stick, but people might also find this to be a pleasant surprise especially if they order ranch dressing for dipping. Another thing I can say is that although the pizza was "late" it was packaged very well, it was still very hot and it looked like it was oven to table, like it hadn't even made a journey in a car! Also, the delivery man brought me a liter of free soda even though I made no complaint about any lateness, a nice gesture. I recommend this place for amazing, cutting edge stuffed pizza. Art of Pizza stays true to its name and is a nice change of pace from more traditional Chicago deep dish.
