OMG!!! I didn't know that hot dogs could taste so GOOD until I tried HOt DOUG's! I recently went to Chicago to visit a friend. She said we have to check it out so we did. i was only in Chicago for 3 days but went to Hot Doug's TWICE! I'm definitely going back to Chicago for some more Hot Doug's! We waited in line for an hour every time but it was so worth it. I wouldn't mind waiting even wait longer. Its only open from 10-4pm so go either really early or really late to avoid lines. If you go with friends, the wait is really not too bad. If you happen to be alone, def take your ipod or DS or whatever. If you're from cali, pls dress warm. It gets REALLY windy there. I loved the Paul Kelley and Spicy Thai chicken sausage. You must try the duck fat fries, you won't regret it! ps. You get to meet Doug Sohn bc he takes your order. He is so nice! My friends and I were wondering if he's half korean or not (bc of his last name) but forgot to.
