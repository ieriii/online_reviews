I was going to go with 5 stars, but I've only been to Lockdown once. This is really a great place. If it is this good for the next visit, I'll definitely bump it up to 5. We went at 8pm on a Friday night and although we did have to wait for a table, it was maybe 10 minutes tops. The food was great. We both got "The Big House" and it was super juicy and the meat was good quality, so was the bacon. Fries were awesome, BBQ sauce was sweet and smokey, just right. You can't beat a hot, juice-drippin' burger! The staff was attentive & friendly. Food came after about 10 minutes. Hot off the grill on a nicely toasted bun. Our waitress was outstanding. I think her name was Sophia (or Sophie). She's the one with the Hank Williams Sr. tat on her arm. Very nice. So, to wrap it up - Great atmosphere, nice screens, great audio at the right volume, great food, great staff, cold beer, reasonable prices. So what's the problem? There isn't one! Go check out Lockdown. P.S. If I have to mention Kuma's, I'll say that Lockdown has the same quality, but with more elbow room and minus the 3 hour wait.
