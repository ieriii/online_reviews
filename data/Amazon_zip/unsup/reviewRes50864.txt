I came in with my girlfriend for an early dinner. We were seated quickly as we were the second couple in the restaurant. The waitress gave us the specials and stared at us for a few seconds without saying anything. After a few awkward moments I gave her my drink order and that got us a few minutes to decide what were going to eat. I ordered the Smoked Pork shoulder and Crispy Pork Belly, and she had the Crab Cake and the Burger. All in all I cannot complain a lick about the food. The Pork Belly had some great tastes, and both of our entrees were tasty. Not enough for 5 stars, but enough for 4. What knocked off the last star was the slightly offputting service. It wasn't bad, I just felt awkward all evening. From the awkward pre-order situation to having to practically get into a staring contest to get her attention, it just felt like we werent a priority.
