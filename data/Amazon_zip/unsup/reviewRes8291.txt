First off, I would like to say I am a huge meat lover. I am not sure why it has taken me so long to visit a Brazilian steakhouse. My boss treated our team out to lunch at Fogo De Chao. I had heard many good reviews and was looking forward to this lunch for weeks. Even before we started getting our rounds of savory meat, I was really pleased with the salad bar. Then it was never ending variety of meats! I LOVED IT. It was every bit as good as everyone says it is. Very high quality meats! The lamb chops are excellent!  I am definitely taking my boyfriend out to a Brazilian steakhouse.
