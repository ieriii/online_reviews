I love love LOVE the way you enter into the Violet hour. The secrecy of it is something so unique. The atmosphere inside transported me to a different place and era. Of the four cocktails I was able to try (Yes!! hammered..) three of them stood out the vodka based Black & white, the rum based Gothic age and the gin based Juliet & Romeo. Absolutely delicious. Two of these have egg whites in them and I was very nervous about ordering them. The waitress assured me that if I didn't like it she would bring me a different one. But I ended up really liking them. In fact I couldn't even feel the smell of the egg whites. They probably use the egg whites to give it a nice frothy texture. They use a variety of bitters in their cocktails and its good because bitter as taste is very misunderstood. When used wisely they can really open up and bring out the other flavors very well. The corn fritters with the lemon aoili, as they call in their menu helped me "sustain". Its a must try!!
