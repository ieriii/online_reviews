My sandwich was fantastic. It was SO good. I still think about that sandwich. I wish it was open hours that are more convenient for me, because my god, their food is good. When you think about the sandwich, (AND the incredible fruit salad) months later you know it is quality grub.  The fruit salad was this perfect combination of sweet and sour with chunks of pineapples and ripe strawberries, but there were tons of marionberries, blackberries, and raspberries. I took it home and ate it by little bits for a few days, and mourned when it was gone.   Like the reviewer before me I also had the avocado, gouda cheese, tomato, and lettuce sandwich on multigrain bread but I did have the mustard, and it was DELICIOUS. It was fresh! It was unlike any other mustard I have ever had, with a very clean bright flavor. My mouth is WATERING as I sit here describing it! The bread was crusty and firm, but not hard or stale. The entire sandwich was just perfect, unquestionable quality. It is seriously one of the best sandwiches I have ever had. The avocado was also perfectly ripened; firm but not mushy, bright avocado green combined with solid creamy yellow. I was SO impressed with this meal!   My latte was good, but nothing stood out about it. How could it next to the sandwich and fruit salad? Latte, Sandwich, and large fruit salad came out to $17.. but worth *every* penny.
