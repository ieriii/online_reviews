I'm giving this 4 stars, but would probably give it 3.5 stars if I could. The place is super cute, first of all! I really liked the look and ambience. I went with my future sister-in-law, who had been wanting to try the place for a while. The first couple minutes we were there were a little off-putting, but it got better. First, we sat down and the table was incredible sticky. Like my glass of wine that I had ordered from the bar made a noise when I picked it up off the table because it was so stuck. Gross! I told the waiter though and he had it cleaned it off. Second, a waiter brought us someone else's food. My fiance has a pet peeve about "auctioning off food" as he calls it, so I give them a little ding for that.  As for the food, we started off with the hearts of palm salad. I have never had shaved hearts of palm like that, which I liked, but there was almost no dressing and the peppercorns were a turn off. This was not a successful dish for me. By now you're probably wondering why I'm giving them 3.5-4 stars, but it's because of the next 2 dishes. The mascarpone polenta with the house ragu was awesome!!! I have never had anything served that way before and it was so rich, creamy, and tasty. I just loved it! The last thing we had was the octopus. I was hesitant about it because it didn't get great reviews, but I really liked it and was happy we ordered it. I wanted to try the truffle toast, but my future sister-in-law is pregnant and they receommended not doing that because the egg is essentially raw. If I ever go back, I will try that though becuase it looked and smelled amazing.
