My favorite dinner spot. Jason & Stephanie are the main maitre'd and hostess and Rodelio Agilbot has a palette unlike any other. Billy Dec, the owner and visionaire of Sunda, has created a masterpiece of Chicago. I have had many dinners at Sunda with close friends, always dining omakase (at the mercy of the exec. chef, a personal friend of one of my friends). I recommend anything here, however, my go-to dish is the assortment of fine tuna sashimi with a side of sweet rice and spicy mayo. the pancit - is new and uniquely crafted in an immersion of east-meets-west with the new, modern fused with the traditional world of the Philippines. The roasted duck is more than delightful and the best roll by far is the Number 10 roll. Sunda also boasts to have a very rare sake. After drinking this particular Sake, i am no longer drinking anything else. Sunda is the only restaurant in the US to be able to serve and carry this particular brand, and it is well worth the price. By the bottle, Tyku is $250. It is sweet and refreshing, with a very subtle and mild aftertaste of the Super Premium Junmai Ginjo sake. Tyku is an award-winning sake and is definitely a fine-drink that needs to be tried. Always on hand- and always chilled to perfection, the perfect combination of the Tuna sashimi platter, number 10 roll, roasted duck, and a bottle of Tyku harmoniously creates a beautiful marriage for a great meal. Sunda is one of the top-sought-after restaurants at the moment in Chicago, where celebs such as Jeremy Piven can be seen dining here, next to you on a regular basis, so when dining on a hot night - thurs.fri.sat, dining at a table is only available by reservation. Very often, you will see Billy Dec greeting his diners and exchanging hellos.
