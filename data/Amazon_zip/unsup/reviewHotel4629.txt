I absolutely loved my stay at Hotel Felix. I booked a King room the weekend of June 20th. The staff was extremely friendly and accommodating. It seemed like 4-star service at a 3-star price. The room was very comfortable; the mattress and pillows were cushy to my taste. I loved seeing the Chicago skyline from my window. I enjoyed a quick workout in the small-ish but clean fitness center. Although it was small, it didn't feel claustrophobic. The windows helped. I also have to compliment the spa. Again, it was very small, but I actually prefer the coziness. The massage therapist gave me one of the best I've had. At $85, it was well worth it. I ate dinner after the massage, and pretty much slipped into food coma after that. Luckily I had a comfy bed, and a big old TV with movie rentals. I totally girled out and rented a chick flick. What better way to spend some days off?  The location is great to walk to various places downtown, but I can't really recommend hanging out downtown. There are much better places to spend your time and money. Fortunately there are plenty of train lines around. I highly recommend a stay at the Felix. Although I booked a great rate on Hotwire, I'd be willing to pay the regular rate, which isn't bad at all.
