I have eaten brunch and dinner at Cafe 28 and always come away happy. The food is yummy and the atmosphere is lovely. Today, I went for lunch and ordered the vegetable sandwich. It was a hot afternoon and veggies with feta sounded light and refreshing. Unfortunately, the feta was sparse, leaving the sandwich dry and flavorless. Salt and/or pepper might have saved the sandwich but they were no where to be found. Nor, was our waitress. It would have been nice to at least been offered ketchup for the fries but at least they matched the theme of the sandwich...flavorless.  After delivering the food, we didn't see our waitress until 10 minutes after the busboy cleared the table. This is normally a very good restaurant but this lunch experience left me culinarily empty and $7 poorer. Will I go back? Yes, but I will not order the veggie sandwich. It's a four star stinker and needs to either have more feta or needs to be pulled from the menu.
