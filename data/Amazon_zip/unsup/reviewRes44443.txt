I can't believe it took me so long to find Wakamono! My fiance lives in Lakeview so we have been to a lot of restaurants within the area. We usually go to Tank for sushi but wanted to try something closer (after all, it was snowing). After reading some reviews on Yelp, we decided to give Wakamono a shot....Now I'm hooked! Their sushi is absolutely delicious, and their wasabi is one of the hottest out there. I've never found wasabi in Chicago to be very spicy, but the wasabi here is a real challenge.
