Been here twice-both times were OK. Ive only tried the curry chips and chopped salad-both were great. Our alcohol beverages were good. Usually bars put too much booze or not enough but Wilde got it right. The only problem I have is the service. Its soooo SLOW. The servers are nice though, not overbearing but not totally absent. Id go again, but would pursue other options first
