Second visit wasn't as impressed as the first time I went. It is sooooooo loud In here! We sat in back last time and did not experience the way too loud atmosphere like we did this time up front. To make matters worse, the table next to us would talk at each other even louder in an attempt to be heard over the rest of the place. On a Sundy morning after a night of drinking this atmosphere is unbearable. The food was ok but I remembered it being better when I was here last Time. I was sad because I was really looking forward to showing the place off to my friend but she hated the noise and was only somewhat happy with her food. She also never saw our server. The tables are so tightly packed that our "big boned" server could not fit between them to face us both when we ordered so my friend kept having to bend her head back awkwardly to face her if she wanted to feel like she wasnt playing a game of telephone. I think this will be my last visit here. The coffee was really good. :)
