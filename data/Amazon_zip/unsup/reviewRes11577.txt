Pizza and Beer, yes please! A friend and I grabbed some beer and pizza last weekend and it was delish. We grabbed a table for lunch on a Sunday and just enjoyed the place. We went for a New Haven style pizza with mushrooms, ricotta and bacon. And we were on different ends of the spectrum on beer, but both enjoyed our drinks. The chocolate cake was delicious and big enough to share with four people. Our server was friendly and attentive. A++. I'm coming back soon.
