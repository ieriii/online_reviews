So I went back a few weeks ago after a while. I love this place! Consistent quality on the pizzas! Love the thin crunchy crust! Though I was just sad that they didn't have the bbq pizza that day. Btw, owner's a great nice guy, he recognized me after writing the review a few months ago. Love small businesses who have great passion for their stuff and customers! ---------------------- I've been seeing this place for months and today I ventured in to grab a late lunch. And I wasn't disappointed at all! 2 pizzas and 1 soda for 5.50! I had the bbq chicken pizza and the margherita. both pizzas were great, had lots of flavor, generous toppings and had a nice chewy crust. definitely will come back for more! o yeah, I checked out their menu and they had a lot of really mouth watering creations!
