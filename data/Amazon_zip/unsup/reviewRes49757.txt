My boyfriend took me here last night for my birthday. It was sooo delicious. We had the Picada Mar y Tierra, which serves two for $57. It was an expensive meal for us, but it was so much food that tasted awesome. We both went away stuffed, which is saying a lot because he's on Atkins and can eat a ton of food. Here's a run-down of each thing that was included: Etrana skirt steak: great flavor Rib-eye steak: very tender and cooked to order Chicken: ok, but not the best of the bunch Calamari: pretty good (but I am not a big calamari fan anyway) Baby octopus: wow! Whatever they cook that in is amazing. Shrimp: fantastic Pork loin: BEST EVER! I want the recipe so bad. Tender and charred to perfection. Arepa: quite good Plantains: LOVED them, but I'm a huge fan anyway Yuca: great Potatoes: great and they didn't even have spices on them I also had the Sangria and that was great, not too sweet, but didn't taste too much like just wine with fruit thrown in. I really want to go back and try the desserts and go back again, and again, and again... but, alas, we're poor.
