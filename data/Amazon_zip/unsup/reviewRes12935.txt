First off, I'm what you'd classify as a "meatatarian". So this place was like going to Mecca for me. The servers are polite and the food is impeccable. I went here with two of my buddies and we were seated pretty damn fast, even though we were like 20 minutes late with a reservation. Everything they brought us was amazing... I have to say, the layout at the "salad bar" is amazing. They had this salmon with gouda cheese that was frigging unbelievable. It was like I was eating gouda cheese, except it was SALMON, so it's gotta be healthy, right? They brought out filet mignon, rack of lamb, leg of lamb, parmesan crusted chicken, a whole bunch of stuff I couldn't even identify... I knew it was some kind of beef and it was tasty as all hell. After we were done, I wanted to go to sleep. Badly. p.s. sign up for their online club and get 50% off once a year. ; )
