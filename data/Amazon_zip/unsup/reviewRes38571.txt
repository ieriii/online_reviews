Eating a deep dish pizza was a priority during my Chicago trip. We found Giordano's and decided to give it a try. We ordered a medium half pepperoni half pepperoni/half pepperoni, mushroon, and pepper pizza. The wait was about 40 min but sooo worth it. The sauce and crust were the best part! It's the best thing to eat when you are super hungry...yum I'm getting hungry just thinking about it.
