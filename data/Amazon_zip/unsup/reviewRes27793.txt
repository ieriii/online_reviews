With so many great mexican restaurants, this is not a place that I would make a second trip to.  I did not find the food to be anything that blew my socks off, it was just decent.  The prices are great, of course, but the staples just were not that good.  The salsa too runny, the chips too greasy and thick and the enchiladas were a bit on the bland side.  The guacamole was the stand out.  We also had a bit of a language barrier when we ordered chorizo tacos and got chorizo and eggs.
