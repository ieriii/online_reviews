Hog heaven! Fried pig ears, beets with goat cheese, rosemary & garlic almonds, and bone marrow spread were all outstanding! Wine selection was wonderful as were the kind staff that mixed up Shirley Temples for our boys. Other items that were worth mentioning were the scrumptious sardines and cheese plates!
