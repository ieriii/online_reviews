After living in Chi-town for 9 years I finally gave it a try and was glad I did. It was good although pricey and some night and day distinctions to be aware of. The place is crowded and has a broad following. You are equally likely to be sandwiched between a group of drunk 20's somethings and a group of aged out of towners. The downstairs is a little brighter and a little more formal looking. The upstairs has much more of a dark lounge type atmosphere, there is actually a couch area. Be sure to request one or the other. On the food order things that you are not going to see traditionally see. Like the number 30, pieces of fillet, long beans and sweat potato in a great sauce. My wife had 29 I believe, which was a more classic dish shrimp and scallops over noodles. It was lame and cost 3x what it should have.  Look forward to going back but not until I let my wallet recharge and work up a solid craving for Vietnamese food.
