Bleck, bland and overpriced. Even the complimentary bread thingies were bad and burnt. I had the country friend steak and stole a bit of the catfish pecan. The steak was not tender nor was it flavorful. The catfish pecan was pretty much completely devoid of flavor. The place is nice enough inside and the service was good. Sorry, not enough to come close to making up for the unremarkable food.
