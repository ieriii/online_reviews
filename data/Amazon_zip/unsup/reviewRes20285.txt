My last meal in Chicago. Warning: the drinks are STRONG!! I got about halfway thru my martini before I switched to water. I ordered the burger, which was excellent. The thing that most stands out in my mind was the steak knife I was using; it had a really cool shape and a little castle embossed on the handle. Fortress brand? Where can I get one of these?
