this might very well become one of our "go to" dinner spots after an amazing first experience. we initially went for chicago restaurant week but weren't entirely won over by the meager selection on the prixe fixe menu and decided to venture back to the main menu in search of something truly inspiring. we settled on the ceviche which was different than any other ceviche i'd experienced in that it was more of a salsa with some lovely avocado cream to compliment it. we'd placed that as our app and then a waiter came around to tell us that the guacamole was on special for 37 cents! what? how could it be? turns out, on tuesdays they have the cost based on the high temperature of that day. we couldn't turn it down at such a bargain, and we were not disappointed with that either. they were also running a $5 mojito special, so i helped myself to the carnivale mojito, which usually runs $8.50. score! yet another delicious bargain. i had the chivita, ($10) which is a ribeye, sliced ham, bacon, cheddar cheese, and a fried egg on a pretzel roll. i'm sure it was a heart attack waiting to happen. it was one of those sandwiches that you want to cuddle up and take a nap with--so warm and flavorful and just plain comforting. it was served with housemade potato and plantain chips (yum!). when i was stuffed and could eat no more, i asked the gentleman who cleared the table to please wrap the remaining sandwich and chips up for me, but i think he misunderstood because when he came back without it, i was sad. not to worry though! our gracious waiter took it upon himself to have them make another one to send me home with as an apology. talk about great service. if all the wait staff and food is that good, i will be back as often as i can.
