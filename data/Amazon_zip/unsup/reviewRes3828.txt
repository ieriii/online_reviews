This chicken spot is a welcome addition to the neighborhood. Before they arrived you had to go to a sports bar to get any decent wings. Sometimes I just don't want an ale.... Tips: - They don't open early. Check the website. - They serve the whole wing. It is slathered in sauce. You will get pretty messy. - Not that hot of sauce. Delicious, but not all that spicy.
