this place has a lot going for it: first and foremost, the beer list. it's extensive -- definitely one of the best i've seen in chicago and extremely reasonably priced. the service was very friendly and attentive. the veggie burger was really tasty, though a bit overwhelmed by the amount of goat cheese they slathered on it. delicious fries. my dining partner in crime got the pulled pork burger, which he did not originally understand was a burger, but was excited to learn that it was. it sounded amazing and he ordered it medium. it came out well done and slightly charred. and the onion rings didn't really look like "onion rings" in the traditional sense, so much as... onions cut into rings. though the burger was way overdone, i still thought it was tasty... so at least one of us liked it! lastly, the atmosphere (decor and music selection) in the back dining room could really use some work. despite the overdone burger and the kind of misguided atmosphere, i'd be back for that beer list alone. it was super new when i visited, so hopefully they're just working out some of the kinks.
