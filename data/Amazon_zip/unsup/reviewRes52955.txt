Harry warmly greeted me at the door on a stormy night on Wednesday. I'd just left Moksha Yoga Studio which is across the street. Despite the rain, the cafe was busy especially on the enclosed patio. Harry recommended I let my server, Phillippel, take care of my vegetarian requests. Phillippe suggested an appetizer, that was not yet on the menu. Portobello mushrooms layered with black beans/cuban potatoes and covered with melted mozzarella. He said he's a carnivore and still loves this dish. Harry came by and suggested the Mango tea. Later still, I had coconut flan. Cost was under $12! I'm going back this Saturday and bringing a friend. Join us! BYOB as well. Continue to visit this restaurant. Loving the avocado salad with a side order of black beans. I suggest they stock some porcelain coffee cups and become an afternoon coffee house. It'd be a great place to spend an afternoon in conversation with a good friend.
