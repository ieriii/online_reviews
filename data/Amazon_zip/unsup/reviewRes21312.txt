Not that this place needs another rave review but I enjoyed my experience here. The service was extremely good and so was my food! The salsa that came with the tortilla chips was spicy...that's always a great first impression! I also enjoyed my entree (combo #4 is a great option for vegetarians!). As I was about to leave, a supremely drunk guy stumbled into the restaurant (it was a Sunday evening). Instead of turning the guy away, the waiter sat him down and patiently served him. I don't know why but that impressed me.
