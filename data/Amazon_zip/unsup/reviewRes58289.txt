I am a huge Rick Bayless fan, so it pains me to not give this place 5 stars.The overall dining experience was no fun. You have to wait in line and you can't order until a table has been assigned to you. Once you get a table assignment you order food, sit down, and wait for food delivery. It just seemed like a roundabout way of accomplishing the same task as a normal sit-down restaurant. Also, we did not have a private table -- my party of 2 was joined by a party of 4 at our six-seater table. The food was decent, but the prices were high, especially considering the portion sizes. The puny amount of salsa in the chips & salsa was so ridiculous that we laughed out loud. Seriously, it was a total joke! The chicken pozole soup was really good, but at $12 we felt it was overpriced. The torta was just ok.We'll probably go back, but for a take-out lunch. This place just wasn't what we were hoping for a Friday night out.
