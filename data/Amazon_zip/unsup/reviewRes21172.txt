101 Tastiest Places to Chowdown in USA Countdown Number: 46 Famous for Chicago dog drive-in restaurant. I love hot dogs. I can easily eat 2 packs all by myself at a friend's BBQ in NY. However, if I were to live in Chicago, I'd much rather go to a drive-in at Superdawg. This place is so cute and classic! I don't have to be from the 1950s era to be able to experience the classic drive-in restaurants. Everything served was fresh and yummy! Got a t-shirt as well - love the vintage design!
