Met some friends here for lunch and being a vegetarian I, not unexpectedly, had few choices. I opted for a couple of sides - seasonal vegetables and house-cut fries. The fries were average but the seasonal vegetables were excellent - unfortunately as the name implies this may be different each time you visit. Prices are a bit on the high side but the ambiance was nice as was the attentive staff.
