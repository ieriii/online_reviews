Whether you're stopping in for some to-go food or bringing the family for dinner this place is okay. The staff is friendly, the food is good (though no where near as fantastic as some make it out to be) and over all it is a fine restaurant. But is it really great? I don't know. I think the one thing that Nuevo Leon has going for it is that the restaurant is so openly welcoming to Pilsen outsiders (read: non-Latinos) in a way that has yet to catch on at some of the other large restaurants on 18th St. Further it is close to the 18th St. L stop, so it is particularly well positioned to serve people from all over the city who are looking for a little taste of Pilsen without wandering too far from the familiarity (and relative safety) of 18th St. Still, the food is inexpensive, the restaurant is BYOB and the service is efficient and fast so its a win no matter how you spin it. Don't forget though: Nuevo Leon is cash only!
