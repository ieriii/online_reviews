I used to really enjoy Calo's, but this most recent dinner was a waste! I ordered for delivery, which used to be fine, but this was a waste of money, plain and simple! While the ribs were okay, they forgot the cole slaw, the roasted potatoes were awful, and the extremely small slice of cheesecake looked as though it had been dropped a few times. I guess it's back to reliable Leona's. This is the last time I'll order from Calo's!
