After hearing many raves about this hot dog wonderland - I finally had a Saturday afternoon to kill on this venture. As expected the wait was over an hour, the owner was very personable and the food was exceptional. I ordered a Thai Chicken Dog with peanut sauce and coconuts. I couldn't have dreamed up a better hot dog to suit my taste buds! My roommate ordered the Gyro dog with olive paste and feta - which also suited her to a T. Doug knows exactly what we want better than we do! He's in our heads! The fries in duck fat and cheese were also out of this world. Now that I've been to Hot Doug's once, here are my expert tips on making your next hot dog venture a great one: 1. Have a light snack before making the trip. The long wait mixed with the delicious smells might make you crazy. 2. Bring entertainment for the line. I.e. friends to chat with, a book, a street performer, etc. 3. If you get thirsty, there's a convenience store close by for a quick water run. 4. When you finally get to the register - don't order something boring. Go wild! And buy lots of it! You waited in line forever - leave satisfied.
