Had dinner, wasnt super impressed. The decor is pretty bad. The place was pretty empty on a Friday night. It was the closest place that wasnt a bar to the comedy show we were seeing down the street. They bring out corn muffins before your meal to every table, which is awesome. They were dry though. 6/10 I ordered the crab cakes because of yelp. I rarely ever order them, and truthfully can probably count on one hand how many times I have ordered them. I do love crab though and per the reviews these are good. I was not disappointed. Full of crab with a good white sauce. 9/10 Side 1 was Mac and Cheese. For a southern style restaurant it sucked. It was a hard layer of cheese on top with barely cheese in the noodles at all. 3/10 Side 2 Sweet potato. It was mashed like regular potatoes, with milk i believe which was odd but not bad. Had some nuts in it also. I would prefer honey/sugar over the mashed variety though or just plain with a bit of butter. 6/10 Drink menu was very limited, even for beers. There are a few cafes down the street with better yelp reviews, full menus, and tons of beers. Next time I will try one of these places at the expense of a typical dinner.
