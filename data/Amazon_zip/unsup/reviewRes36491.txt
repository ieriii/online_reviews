I love breakfast food and Meli did not disappoint me! The interior is beautiful and has a nice cafe feel to it. However, it is a small space so I imagine you will be very close to other people during busy hours. There is street parking (paybox) on Halsted. I had the Thursday Skillet, which featured eggs, mushrooms, and sausage. It's a pretty standard dish, but I thought all the ingredients were flavored just right. My friend got the Summer Creepes and she liked them a lot even though I thought they were a bit too sweet. Overall a much better choice than IHOP for just a couple dollars more per person.
