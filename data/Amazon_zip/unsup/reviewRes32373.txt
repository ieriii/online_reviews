I had dinner here with a friend before the Vampire Weekend concert around the corner at the Aragon Ballroom. It wasn't too crowded although we were eating a little early, before the dinner rush. This was my first foray into Ethiopian food and was very pleased. The injera was tangy and strange but good. I favored the meat dishes over the veggie/bean ones. Best of all though, my friend and I polished of a bottle of honey wine and it was lovely.
