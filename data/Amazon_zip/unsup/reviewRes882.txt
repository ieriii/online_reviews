Why it gotta' be this way? A great place should be busy with the people but why's it got to be busy with the hipsta nation? I hope it was just my visit and the crowd is more diverse than the action I ran into. Well, the dogs were so good and diverse I sorta' wished I could stomach more than two, sorta' wished i could have come back for rounds two and three. YEAH! That good! Result: I am a big fan!
