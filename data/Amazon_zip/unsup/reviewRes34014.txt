I thought this place was great. I went with a friend on 9/1/08. We had a 20 min. wait which we spent at the bike store next to Yolk. Great atmosphere. Fast-friendly service. Clean. Big portions. Great prices. Yummy "orange/strawberry juice!" I had a GREAT omelet and my friend had a skillet dish. We both got pancakes on the side and we were in heaven. These were the best pancakes we have had to date. They were light yet a bit crispy on the edges with a perfect flavor. We both loved our brunch and will go back again!
