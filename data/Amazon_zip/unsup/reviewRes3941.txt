After reading everyones' reviews, I thought the chicken skin would be like something you get on chinese roast duck or roast pig and it would be really crispy. It was not. It was just deep fried so long it kinda dried out the chicken. The sauce on the Seoul Sassy was just the korean gojhuchang sauce (the stuff you use for bibimbap). Also, the chicken was chopped up so badly so you couldn't recognize which part of the chicken you were eating. Overall, the chicken was just ok. The cashier was nice and was able to save me some money but letting me know that it was better deal to get whole chicken and letting me try 2 sauces than ordering 2 half chickens.
