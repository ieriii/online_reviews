A lotta rave reviews about this place. I just don't get it. They're tongue tacos were shit. No other way to put it- pasty and lacking flavor. The tamales tasted like they had just been defrosted and crumbled when I looked at them. Our server was friendly, but also brought me the wrong check three times. The washrooms were clean, I guess that's a plus.
