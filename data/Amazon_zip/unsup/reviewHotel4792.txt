I've been staying here for a week, due to my floors being redone at my home. The valet lost my car key, then gave me the wrong one.. The food here isn't great, although the Italian place here is good. State and Lake isn't all that good. The bfast isn't worth a penny... The rooms are nice, large for the price.. I a suite, and that was nice.. The technology in the phones in the rooms are a bit to much, to hard to figure out.. I just want to make a call!! They had free WiFi, but then with out notice, they are charging, I didn't like that!! I also had my family with me, and the crib they provided was something you would have found in an old Russian 1950's hospital.. VARY SCARRY!! We didn't end up using it.. Strange they have people get these cribs for hotels, who don't have kids!! All in all, for the price, I would stay here again, but there's a lot to improve on,...
