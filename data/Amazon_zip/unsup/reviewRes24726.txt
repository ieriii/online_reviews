I came here waiting and wanting to use a http://restaurant.com certificate, but only to give it away to the couple next door because we got in on their anniversary super special and got a way better deal than the certificate was for. The setting was romantic, dark, the place is almost underground and there are candles everywhere. The staff was extra friendly and very accommodating with the fact that we had to run to a show within the hour and made everything for us quick quick quick! They do get crowded quickly and the tables are rather close so not only are you intimate with your date but ... also with everyone else. The tables are a bit cramped especially if you're ordering a set and they only do oil fondue which I wasn't as used to since I am used to La Fondue in Saratoga which does multiple flavors of soups. Either way, it was a great experience and the cheese and chocolate fondues were delicious. The vegetables are a bit ... large chunked but other than that no complaints.
