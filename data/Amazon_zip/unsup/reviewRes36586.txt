I'm shocked and appalled that I haven't written a review until now because Indie has been somewhat of a sushi staple for me for awhile now. Here's the thing about Indie: I love their sushi. It's always tasty, fresh, and very well prepared and presented. I've just recently discovered some of their specialty rolls and it's like walking up to Disney World for the first time. It's wonderful. Because I've been going here a while, I can say confidently that sometimes the "others" of the dining experience: service, presentation, and consistency in food preparation can be hit or miss. It's generally always good...but there are times that the food has been really excellent and other times that it's just "well, that was okay, huh?" Overall, I go back because I know what they have done in the past. But sometimes it can be a little lackluster. And whatever you do, don't ever get delivery from this place. With that, you're just askin' for trouble.
