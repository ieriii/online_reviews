Oh fox and obel. I can sum up this place in 2 words--consistently inconsistent. My friend Dave coined that term for f&o and it should be their motto. I live two blocks from here so I frequent often for a last minute dinner or quick brunch. One time you'll fall in love with their red pepper hummus. The next time you get it, craving the same deliciousness as before, it is a completely different recipe. Also, the staff here is beyond incompetent. Don't get me started on the servers in their cafe or the people behind the deli counter. It's like they rotate the employees to different areas of the store with no training whatsoever...for the prices they're charging, they should have consistent food with consistent staff. save your money.
