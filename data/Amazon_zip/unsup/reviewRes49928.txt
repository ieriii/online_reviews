It was an all you can eat buffet brunch. Sounded good and actually tasted very good. There was only one waitress for 3 tables- didn't seem that difficult. But apparently it was. She tried, though. Service, water and stuff, was slow because she didn't have to serve us food since it was a buffet. I'll give it another chance. I hear it is better for dinner.
