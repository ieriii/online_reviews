We recently dined at Bin 36 for my fiance's birthday and were pretty disappointed with the food and service. The wine was so-so. We love our wine and thought that it was a fun idea to have so many different options for wine flights; however, we weren't very impressed with the wines we actually tasted.  When we ordered our meals, I specifically told the waiter about my allergies and he said that he would check with the kitchen to make sure nothing I was allergic to was in the meal. After a long wait, our food came and the mussels and salad I ordered clearly had dairy in both the mussel broth (it was some sort of buttery sauce) and the creamy salad dressing. I decided not to send it back and later had a stomach ache from eating the food - luckily I am not deathly allergic to any of these things but if someone who came in to eat was, they would be extremely unhappy with this place. We decided not to get dessert since I had something already made at home so we ordered some dessert wine for us to have instead. The waiter knew it was my fiance's birthday so he decided to try and be thoughtful and brought him out a candle on a plate for him to blow out. A CANDLE! No dessert, no small cookie or brownie or anything....WEIRD! It was awkward and we thought that they would've been better off not trying to do anything at all if they couldn't spare a small cookie from the kitchen. We will not be returning - There are definitely way better wine bars/restaurants out there...
