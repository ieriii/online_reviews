Fairly crowded on the Saturday night I went there. My friend and I drank at the bar while we waited for a table and the rest of our party. Service was good. The bartenders seemed to know a lot about every beer we asked about. The beer selection is extensive and reasonably priced-- much better than many other places I've tried. I recommend Kwak, Rasputan's Russian Imperial stout, and Dragon's Mlik (if you want something heavier), and Matilda if you want something more moderate. The downstairs is crowded and lacking in ambience, but there are some cozy spots in the upstairs. I'll be back again.
