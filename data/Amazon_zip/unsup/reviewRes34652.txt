Great place for delicious sushi!! Fun place to dine and great place to get carry out! Lava is one of my favorite rolls! Haven't found one like it anyplace else. Definitely not a low calorie option, but delicious. Also the salad with ginger dressing is a must have. This place provides consistently delicious and fresh sushi with plenty of options!
