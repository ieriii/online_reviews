After this place was recommended to us by parents, bosses, and friends, we finally went for Valentine's Day this year. We enjoyed some of the best food we've had in Chicago! My husband ordered the Steak Medallions (or something like that) and said it was easily the most amazing steak he's ever had. The place is huge, with multiple rooms. We sat in the back, which wasn't as cool as the front, by the bar, but still nice with great service. I give it only four stars because it was a bit pricey!
