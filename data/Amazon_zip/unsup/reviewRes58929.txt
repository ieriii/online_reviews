This establishment would have received a higher star rating had the owners been absolutely honest about this restaurants concept. Sunda and its menu are not original concepts, it is a copy of a restaurant located at the Encore in Las Vegas, called Okada. The only problem is, Sunda doesn't do the concept nearly as well as Okada.
