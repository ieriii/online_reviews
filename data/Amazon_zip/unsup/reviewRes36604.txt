This is no five star restaurant. At best, Indie deserves 3 stars for having decent, if unspectacular, food but loses major points on service and atmosphere.  Based on our first two experiences, one take-out and the other in-restaurant, here's what we've found: The Good The food is generally pretty good. As others have pointed out, pan-Asian menus don't often work out but Indie seems to have pulled it off. The shrimp shumai appetizers were light and delicious, leaving us craving more. The penang main course had robust flavor. The sushi wasn't bad, although we've definitely had better. The Bad On the downside, the restaurant is narrow and very cramped with wait staff scurrying back and forth constantly. The long, narrow bench seat felt like a rack. Although the staff are all quite friendly, we seemed to have multiple servers, which sometimes meant no one at all. The sushi we ordered sat on the sushi bar for a solid 10 minutes waiting for the penang to be finished.  Summary ratings (out of 5 stars): Food: * * * - not bad but not out of sight either Atmosphere: * * - cramped, busy and uncomfortable Service: * * - friendly but slow and disorganized
