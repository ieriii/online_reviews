If you're looking for authentic SE Asian cuisine, and you know a place a better than Tank Noodle, PLEASE TELL ME. I have not tried much on the menu, but I can tell you this, the few items I have had there, are the best I've had since being in SE Asia (Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia). My ONLY critique of this place is that they seemed to spice our food for an american pallet. Granted I'm American, caucasian, so maybe they served us a tamed down version of what might be spicier to their primary clientele. (you know the food is authentic when you're the only americans in the place!!) But my wife and I like it traditional, so be sure you ask them to use the spice as if they were serving the locals!WE LOVE THIS PLACE!! BEST COCONUT CURRY I'VE HAD IN THE USA!!!
