Good beer. Good food. Helpful staff. Never had trouble getting a seat, but it's usually pretty active. Very nice beer list which is frequently updated. Bar staff seems genuinely interested in helping you match a beer to your taste. They have all of the fun glasses for each beer too. And who doesn't love that - beer from a funny glass! The burgers are good bar burgers with good value for price too. I read somewhere, I think in TimeOut Chicago maybe that the burgers were overhyped. All I know is this - the burger tasted great and was reasonably priced. Good layout for sitting at the bar with several screens showing sports that are easy to watch or easy to ignore. My wife and I have been four or five times now and always walk out satisfied.
