Beautiful art deco decor mixed with modern and a great location make this a great hotel to stay during your trip to Chicago. The hotel is right across from the Trump tower, with the Chicago River separating it, and steps away from Michigan Ave. We would go have breakfast next door at the Corner Bakery every morning and just look around at the wonder that is downtown Chicago. Also, each floor had a bottled water refilling station. The downsides were that the beds and pillows were not that comfortable and the TV was very small. There was no iron or ironing board in the room, but they were located in a closet down the hall. Otherwise, it was a great stay.
