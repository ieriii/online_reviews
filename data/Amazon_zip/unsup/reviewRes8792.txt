Love Love Love the food here! The shrimp and dill rice combo is amazing! Also definitely love the button mushrooms with pomegranate sauce. The service is fast and very friendly and the restaurant itself looks very cozy. It's a great place to go there with a group of friends and just enjoy the night with some great food and laughter. :)
