Heard a lot about The Gage and was eager to go there. On a weekday night after work, it was very crowded and exremely noisy. The service was good despite the crowd. Overall, somewhat overpriced. Wines by the glass were surely good but also more expensive than most higher-end places. In this economy, it might be better to go to a place that doesn't charge such high prices. But, judging from the packed place, people will pay those prices. Maybe I will go back, but I am not in any hurry to do so.
