Irazu is overrated. My last roommate ate here on a nearly daily basis for a while, and I still don't understand the appeal--except for the milkshakes, the food here is nothing special. It's not bad, it's not good, it just is. (One particularly uninspiring item is the salsa, which comes in ketchup containers on each table.) Believe me, I've tried to like this place--I've eaten at Irazu probably four times thanks to friends who loved it. The restaurant is tiny and popular, so expect a wait. In short: order yourself a milkshake here, but don't expect much from majority of the menu.
