Went on a Saturday night, around 8pm, and it was SO packed. The tables are really close together, and when it's full it's almost impossible to get around. Love the BYOB. Had to ask at least twice for wine glasses though after we sat down. We had a fresh veggie roll and a veggie egg roll for apps and it was good. I had a chicken dish with jalapenos, peppers, and a decent sauce. Most everyone enjoyed their entrees. Reasonably priced. I would recommend reservations if you go on a weekend night.
