I love Sultan's Market! Their falafel sandwich is one of my top 5 favorite foods.  Also try the Chicken shawerma and tabboule. The inside seating area can be a little crowded around lunch time on weekends. They have a large outdoor area that double the seating capacity, but don't expect it to be set up soon after they open. It's usually 1-2 hours after before the tables are set up. Make sure your bring cash. They don't take cards and the ATM inside charges a $2.50 service fee.
