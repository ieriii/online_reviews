Piece Pizza is some of the best Pizza in this city. I feel like we have tried a lot of places, but we keep coming back here for more. The only down side is that they don't deliver. :( It is a great place to watch your favorite sports teams and on Thursday nights they karaoke! It can get a little crowded so it is best to get there earlier than later in the evening.  Pizza comes with different sauces and the crust is thin and perfectly crispy. Their pizza is not greasy either. They are also a micro brewery...I usually go for the golden arm....it is the lightest, but they had one last week called camel toe...he he...I laughed every time someone ordered that one....
