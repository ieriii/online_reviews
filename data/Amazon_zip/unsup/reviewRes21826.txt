Went to XOCO for dinner... the line was abour 45 minutes. Bunch of my friends went there for lunch and the line was about an hour. This is the new hot spot for lunch and dinner. You can watch Rick Bayless command in the kitchen, which was kind of cool. The menu is great, lots of street type mexican food but obviously not street quality. Highly recommend the churros... probably the best i have had. The soup dishes were great. I had the seafood one, which tasted really fresh. All of my friends liked this restaurante.
