Nice location. You can see and smell the wonderful wood roasted meat as you approach the restaurant window. Nice comfortable, contemporary environment. Easy on the eyes. Top notch service. They will turn the world upsidedown to assist. Knowledgeable and warm staff. Start with the Caipirinha and have a couple. Move onto the salad bar. Fresh, wonderful variety. Great starting point for the meal ahead, but don't fill up there. You have 20 different kinds of meat to sample. The Gauchos are quick and visible so you don't sit long before they're bringing you more meat. Nice aspect to the service is that if you prefer top sirloin and lamb chops, that' s all they'll offer you until you ask them to stop. It's all about you and what you want. Last time I was there, I ordered an expensive glass of wine that didn't turn out to be to my liking. They whisked it away, no questions asked, and brought me another to sample. No remarks or snide comments. Management reps were constantly checking and supplying service support the entire time. Not bothersome. Attentive. Couldn't walk out and not from the drink, but from the many, many portions I happened to have succumb to. They do feature a nice papaya ice cream and liquor combo that is actually soothing to the system. Always a great experience. Lots of fun for small towner relative types visiting over the holidays or vacations. A great end to a great day. Can't say enough. . . . . . . . . . .
