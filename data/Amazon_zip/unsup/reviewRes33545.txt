I first came here years ago! Since I was back visiting (I used to live in the Chicago area), I was very excited when my friend suggested meeting up here for dinner. I ordered the spinach/cheese ravioli with marinara and it had a distinct "seafoody" taste to it, which is pretty odd to say the least. If I go back, I would order something totally different!
