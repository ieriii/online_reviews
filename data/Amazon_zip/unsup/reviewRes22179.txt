Short story the free cabbage app is delish, super spicy even for a Mexican girl that puts hot sauce on everything. The 3 chilli chicken was delish, the Mongolian beef was average. Overall the portions are huge! We walked away with left overs that could have fed 2 more people. I would def go back next time I'm in Chicago.
