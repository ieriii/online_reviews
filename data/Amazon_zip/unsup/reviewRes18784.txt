Love this place. The couple burger options I've tried have all been excellent, although I do wish they would switch in some new stuff soon or I'm going to start getting a little bored. Nevertheless, the beer list is superb. Lost of odd and interesting things on tap and it changes all the time. Only qualm would be that with a beer list this great, I want to feel like I can stop in for just a drink and the layout doesn't really make that seem possible. The bar area in front doesn't have much seating and its a major traffic route from the front door to the dining area so I fear getting in the way. Although, I recently saw that there is a second room behind the bar that I never noticed before so maybe that's also fair game for the drink-only crowd.
