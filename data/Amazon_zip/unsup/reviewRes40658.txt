SUCH a great restaurant. In a city that lacks in exclusive eateries, finally, there is a warm and charming restaurant that is worth a 2 hour wait! The staff and managers are welcoming and accommodating, and over cushion the wait time (we were told 2 hours- we maybe waited an hour and a half). This is not your average, Chicago type Sunda, Rosebud, or Cheesecake factory crowd. Their patrons know food, and it only adds to the charm and warmth of the restaurants environment. We are already planning on going back in the next week or so. Make sure someone orders the Chicken!
