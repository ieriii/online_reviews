Dined here compliments of the BF for VDay and had the the privilege of enjoy a 6-course, rock-ballade inspired meal filled with love, flavor, and exceptionally creative food combos. Yam gnocchi just oozed goodness, foi gra paired with cherry preserves was like a modern, twisted delicious cherry pie, and the Pillow Talk cocktail was my favorite of all St. Germain drinks thus far. Staff was fantastic and so well-versed with each dish that I felt I was in a Top Chef episode when being explained each one. Luckily, no one got sent home. And if they did can they please come to my home and cook the same meal over again. And of course, the infamous Graham Elliot popcorn that I will never get enough of. Graham Elliot knows how to rock my taste buds.
