Where should I start? How about the amazing bloody mary which was so good almost everyone at the table slurped it down before the food arrived... Service was fast (especially compared to some of the other reviews I've read here)! The menu choices are superb with quality dishes I've never seen anywhere else (I had the shrimp and grits - a very rich and delicious treat; the crunchy french toast "mmmmmm;" and the salmon cakes which were really good but not as good as the others). All the classics are there, too. Don't worry there is something for everyone and the menu is big but not too daunting. I also would like to give bonus points solely for the great atmosphere. Fun but stylish decor featuring chicken themed art and the very large spacious dining areas are a real make this brunch venue in the city a regular on my rotation!
