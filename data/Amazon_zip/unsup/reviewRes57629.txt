We have been here many times. Not as pricey as some other fondue places. The atmosphere is very romantic and making your food is a lot of fun. The only complaint I have is we had a reservation and still had to wait about a hour and a half. We ended up taking a taxi and going to sears buliding( still call it sears) and then going back. Although that was fun to do I hated the fact we still had to wait that long for our table. This actually would not stop me from going back. I love the place.
