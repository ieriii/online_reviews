This place is wonderful and bizarre and excellent and weird. I love it. Quirky place with great seating areas so that you feel you've got a private little "box" to yourself. Went there for drinks on our anniversary and had such a great time. Love the low lighting, tall booths, and classic/crazy cocktail menu. Our server was a woman dressed in the style of Charlie Chaplin, which I found amusing and disturbing and awesome all in one. Basically, this place is not a place I'd typically love, but I love it! This would be the perfect place to go with a date or to take friends visiting from out of town. Probably not the best place to take your mom. She won't get it.
