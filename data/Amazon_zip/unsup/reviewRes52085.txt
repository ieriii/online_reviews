If good food to you is slathered in flavorless cheese and drowned in tomato sauce then go to Gino's but if you have finer tastes stay away. To be fair, I'm just not a deep dish fan, as I painfully discovered at Gino's. Maybe I was bitter about not being able to make reservations at Alinea. Maybe it was the writing all over the furniture that apparently appeals to hipster tourists. Also, they made us wait for 20 minutes when there were dozens of available tables. They claimed that they could only seat us if we chose the "lunch express" option which offers personal sized deep dish pizzas w/ a salad. The portions are HUGE - definitely get the smallest size if you're with only 2 people. They let you split the pie into two different flavors/toppings. We had the meat sampler w/ beef and bacon. The crust is at once dry and oily. It leaves an after taste very reminiscent of Pizza Hut's (which isn't bad, of course, but not when your paying 200% more). I'm giving it a two since the service was actually super attentive. What's interesting is that they are so used to tourists that they always first ask whether you've been to Gino's before. I don't regret this visit since its one of those obligatory tourist visits and if you leave Chicago w/o going to Gino's or Giordano's you'll never know.
