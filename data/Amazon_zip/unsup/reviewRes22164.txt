I had been wanting to try this place for a while but the odds were definitely against me on the day we finally decided to go. It was cold and rainy, traffic was horrible,my bus was in an accident and the el was delayed. Any normal person might have just thrown in the towel but me and my bottle of red were on a mission! Finally we (the wine and and I) arrived and all I could think was "get this bottle open STAT"! We were given a corkscrew and an odd plastic tumbler. I was too flustered to pass judgment so I drank my red wine from a plastic (excuse me, acrylic) cup. I was starving and everything on the menu looked amazing or I was starving SO everything on the menu looked amazing. Whatever the case, I was staring at a pretty amazing menu. I wanted to try something truly Costa Rican so I went with the Tilapia Casado, which is a generous piece of tilapia with caramelized onions served with white rice, black beans, cabbage salad, an over easy egg, plantains and an added roasted jalapeno for some spice. Everything was flavorful and the egg worked well although I thought it seemed odd at first. I was quite impressed with my dish, so impressed that I ordered a steak version of my meal to go for the old ball and chain back home. In addition to the food, I thought the guitar player was a nice little touch. Great background music that fit well without being too intrusive. A little loud depending on where you're seated but not too bad. A return visit is inevitable and your first visit is encouraged. Go!
