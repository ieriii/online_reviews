Just like being in Vietnam! I have been here to many times to count and thought it was time I wrote a review. After trying several places in the city, Tank continues to be one of the best, fastest and most inexpensive places for delicious Vietnamese cuisine. Their menu is extensive, staff courteous and the food hits the spot every time. Its no wonder I make 30 min trip up to Argyle whenever I get a craving.
