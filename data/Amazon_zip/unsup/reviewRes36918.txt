Meli is absolutely one of the best brunch places in Chicago. I'm not embarrassed to admit that I come here every weekend with my boyfriend- after frequenting this restaurant so much, we almost exclusively order from the "specials" menu insert. I have never had a bad meal here and have had everything from Eggs Benedict to frittatas, French toast to omelettes. Their juice selection is great, the coffee is Lavazza, and they serve your toast with homemade marmalades that always rock. If you ever see "French toast sampler" as a special- this is what you need to order. Blueberry French toast, zucchini French toast, and carrot cake French toast- amazing! Service is very quick and professional. The only possible downside is the potential wait you face if you come after 10 on the weekends. I've come around 10:30 and waited an hour for a table for two.... I've also come around 1:00 and waited just under an hour. To me, I don't mind, when the food is this amazing... but a good tip is to get up early and start your Saturday or Sunday with a delicious breakfast... at 9 AM, I've never waited more than 5 minutes. This is definitely an amazing brunch spot, whether you're in the mood for something savory or sweet. Just come hungry and (maybe) ready to wait a little bit for some delicious food.
