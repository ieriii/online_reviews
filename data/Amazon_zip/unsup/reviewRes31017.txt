The good: totally a fan of the drinks! Try the mai tai, rising sun cocktail (with macadamia nut liqueur), or taffy apple! The pre-dinner rice with sweet sauce and onion was a cute take on the typical "bread basket".  The bad: took a while for the food to come out. The charsiu bbq pork was dry, but I always love me some white rice. The sushi rolls we tried (crunchy pig, hidden lobster and spicy "tale of two tunas") were nothing mind blowing. A's chicken was ordinary and definitely something you've tasted before. The ugly: I's wine was served in a cracked glass! Danger! The manager was nice enough to come out and bring some alcohol wipes and bandaids and comp'ed the drink though.  Like the decor. It's trendy and sleek; just be careful not to run into the glass dividers throughout the restaurant! +100 on Opentable and $12 for valet.
