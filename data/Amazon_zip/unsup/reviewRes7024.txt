I ended up at Sapori Trattoria very randomly one day last year when it was a rainy Cinco de Mayo and Mayan Palace was too crowded. It looked nice from the outside and so we decided to give it a try. Mind you, I had no idea it was a popular place, but we were all impressed with the food and wine we ordered. The staff is very friendly and the food is good. I believe I got a mushroom risotto that I enjoyed. Others got various pasta dishes that they liked. I will return one day!
