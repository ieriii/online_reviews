I love this place. The atmosphere here is nice and the food is fantastic. I love the lamb shank here. I also have tried their kababs (lamb, beef, chicken), and loved them. Atmosphere: Nice atmosphere. nice decorations on the wall. Food: Love the food. Lamb shank was really soft and the sauce that was with it was great. Also gives an abundance of rice and a grilled tomato. Price: Sort pricey but well worth it. I'd say the dishes are probably around the $15 dollar mark. Service: Service was great. I never really had to wait that long for a table, even when it was busy. waitresses were nice and attentive. Overall: I would probably say that this is one of the places in Chicago I can keep going to and not get sick and tired of going to. The food and service are great and it has a nice feel to it.
