We dined here for dinner with a party of 10. Even though we had two servers helping with various sections of meal ( the beginning and serving dishes) throughout the meal they were no where to be found. They were not friendly nor approachable. I loved the food however. I would give it five stars if their service improved vastly. I had the cheese and olives dish, mussels, brussels sprouts and a bit of the chocolate banana dish. All were very good. If the service improves this place can be top notch on my list.
