I know good pizza, and have been spoiled with it due to growing up in Brooklyn. I like thin crust, the type you have to fold together to eat....well we ordered the thin crust tomato pizza and it was really bad. The sauce tasted like some supermarket artificial brand and the crust was the worst ive ever tasted in my life.
