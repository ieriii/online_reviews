Went with a pretty good sized group of meat eaters from work (good sized as in they know their meat and can put it down) so I figured it would be pretty good.  I have to say being from KC I was a little hesitant when they told me we were going to a BBQ place. Not that I'm a BBQ snob but there is no shortage of outstanding BBQ joints in KC but I tried to go in w/ an open mind.  Over all an outstanding dining experience. Great atmosphere, cool vibe and VERY attentive staff. We never waited or had to ask for anything twice, drinks were always full, great recommendations on how much to order (5 carnivores so we wanted to make sure we had enough to eat), very friendly, etc. Highlights; as most of the other reviews have stated, the Kobe Beef Ribs are a MUST; they are T-Rex sized ribs and def worth the price tag. The Pulled Pork was tender and moist and the competition ribs (we got both the St. Louis and the Baby Back) were very good. The Baby Back were a little dry (only complaint and it's minor) but all in all, very good.  The smoked dry-rub wings were outstanding and the house bacon cheddar hush puppies were a hit.  Enjoyed the sauce variety and if I had to pick one, would go w/ the Spicy (if you like sauce on your BBQ).  Had the opportunity to go on a kitchen tour w/ Chef Whippen which if you have the chance, I highly suggest. It was pretty cool to see where the magic happens and the smokers are impressive. Side note, they have a very nice list of bourbons which was a plus! Def recommend Chicago q if you're in CHI and are in the mood for BBQ. It's not cheap but it's worth it, even if just for the Kobe Beef Ribs.
