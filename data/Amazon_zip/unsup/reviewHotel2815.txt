I like to get loud and party probably more than most other people. However, when I'm trying to sleep in my hotel room and I can hear people screaming across the atrium and pounding on doors at 3 am., that's just bullshit. Seriously, there was this dude pounding on a hotel room door across the atrium for at least 20 minutes. I'm sure the rest of the hotel guests were awakened just as I was. It took the security guard 20 minutes to get up there and confront the jackass. On the brightside, the staff at the hotel was really friendly and helpful. The valet parking crew really shined. My room was clean and comfortable. The free buffet breakfast is a very nice plus. I'm a fan of the Embassy Suites concept but I don't think I'll stay at one again if something isnt done to soundproof the rooms more sufficiently. That is unless I'm there to party all night and to be the one to make all that noise! The Embassy Suites needs to make their rooms a little more soundproof however with all of the insanity that goes on all through the night in the atrium.
