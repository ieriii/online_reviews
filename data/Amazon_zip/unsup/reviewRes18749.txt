A very extensive beer menu. I got the Crispin hard apple cider. Goat cheese fondue dip was okay not what you expect at a bar. The frenchie burger -Brie,spinich, truffle, fried red onion. The burger was good but I only gave it 4 out of 5 stars because you can't substitute the burger part. I prefer Kuma's because sometimes I'm in a chicken kind of mood.
