My Mother In Law told me I should try this place out. I didn't want to hurt her feelings and tell her I had already heard about this place and that it was on my list to visit. But she watches Check, Please religiously and is so thoughtful in writing down the names of places she thinks the hubs and I would like to visit, I felt compelled to visit. Although I went there without her son, so maybe I shouldn't tell her I visited...I want to stay on her good side. A trio of us took in a late lunch at Piece. Sad that I missed out on the karaoke, but that will have to be for another time. A lot of TV's in the place tuned into ESPN and the Cub's game. I like the wide open windows that made the place bright and sunny. There were a lot of folks lunching that day, but it didn't seem crowded at all. We started with the chips and salsa. The salsa was very fresh, nicely prepared and was more like a pico de gallo. Nice spice. We opted for 2 10-inch pizzas, One "red sauce" with sausage and spinach and one "white" (olive oil and garlic) with fresh tomatoes and basil. It was just enough food for us to feel satisfied and not overly stuffed, and with some leftovers to take home. I'm a sucker for fresh basil and fresh garlic, so that's probably why I liked the white pizza better. Both pizzas had a nice thin crust, nice crunch near the outer edge. And the toppings were really tasty. Although I did find our Red pizza sauce a little watery--it was still good. The brews were good too--ice cold and perfect with the pizza. The Golden Arm was just OK, but I also had a taste of the cousin's Dark N Curvy, which I found to have a lot more flavor. The Bro's beer was good too--Worryin' Ale. At least I know what to get next time. Service was friendly and prompt. I'll come back and yes, next time I'll bring the hubs...
