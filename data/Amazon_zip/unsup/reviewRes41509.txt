You love pho? Go. You saw the episode of "No Reservations" where Tony goes to Vietnam. It made you hungry. Go. This is one of the greatest places to take someone visiting Chicago. Try their aromatic Pho ga or pick another favorite vegetarian or not. It comes with the traditional heaping tray of herbs and garnish to add to your pho. Try the taro root boba or the many others. Bull penis soup -covered. Sizzling crepe, baguette sandwiches, and every drip coffee, on the menu and great. Do it and walk out loving the city.  Street parking is near if you drive, or the Argyle stop on the Red Line is less than a block East.
