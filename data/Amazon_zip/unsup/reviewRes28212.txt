From Austin and in town for a Guy's Trip. Most of the group were not Foodies but we picked this as our place for our "big meal". We heard about Graham from some readings and personal reviews. Make no mistake - This is a date place or for two couples. We knew that but wanted to try their food. So not complaining. Food is out of this world! I mean it is one of the better combinations of price and food I have had in a while. The menu changes all the time so ask advice when you go. You can eat food that would cost you 1.5x more at this place - that is value. Good: - Appetizers - Tartar and Tuna - Appetizer - Foie Gra with pop rocks - i know it is strange but it was killer - Bison and the Lamb (deconstructed Gyros - way good). - Wine list - not too pricey for the selection Poor: - Service - it is all over the reviews of this place that they have too many people per server. I could not agree more. (examples - taking drink orders and not coming back for 15 min with the drinks, stacking the apps and the main courses too close together, taking the wine orders and disappearing but returning with the wine and then leaving the bottles on the table for 5 min unopened - just seems like people are swamped.) I really hope that GE reads these reviews and realizes that he has some of the best food in town and it is getting dragged down by not adding one or two more servers to the room. I have been to Spiaggia, OTOM, MOTO, Sepia, etc. (I get to town a bit and always eat out). This place really stacks up and is not off the charts expensive but you have to fix the service ratios or the loyal ones will stop coming. Judging by the number of comments on service with specific examples, this cannot be just a bad server. I would eat here again and would even go by myself if I can eat at the bar.
