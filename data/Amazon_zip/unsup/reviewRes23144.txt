I'm in for 5 stars because this Greek Town anchor is our current favorite for what it sets out to do: provide excellent food, good prices, huge portions and attentive service. I will admit that in the summer we head over to Athena for outside dining, but for consistency it's Greek Islands for us. We were there a week ago on a midweek night, and the place was characteristically crowded. Even so, we were seated right away, and we had a bit of retsina on the table in minutes. We love the ample starters and all of that sesame bread. Getting a few appetizers basically insures that you will not have enough room for your entree and that you will be bringing home leftovers.
