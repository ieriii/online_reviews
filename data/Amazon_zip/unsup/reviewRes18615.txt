Authentic delicious mexican food.  I ordered a bowl of pozole and it was the best pozole I've ever had. Especially on a cold Chicago afternoon. I also split an order of mexican hot chocolate and churros with a friend. The waitress was kind enough to split it in two cups for us. my friends' tortas special for the day (I believe it was carnitas) was delicious as well. These four items were the perfect amount of food for the two of us.
