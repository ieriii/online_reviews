I've never stayed at a W before, but W on Lakeshore was pretty good. It does seem to be a little older... you can tell the rooms are a little worn, but everything is still pretty nice. The breakfast is really good here, so if you're somehow able to get breakfast in with your rate, it's totally worth it. My only complaint is that they initially charged me for breakfast even though it was part of my company negotiated rate. We solved that pretty quickly though, so I was satisfied. I'd definitely stay here again if my company was paying or if I got a really good rate.
