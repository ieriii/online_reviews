Frontera has been on The List of restaurants to try for a long time now. And I finally got to cross it off The List. My overall experience was great. We arrived shortly after 5:00 and waited only 15-20 minutes for our table. While we were waiting, we ordered a couple of drinks at the bar. There is a great selection of Mexican beers. I had a Negra Modelo, a dark lager, one of my favorites. For an appetizer, we ordered tamales. The flavors were good, but we weren't floored by it. My entree, however, was very delicious. I ordered the grilled mahimahi, which came with a side of sweet potatoes and a pineapple salsa. The mahimahi was well cooked and the salsa added just a bit of spice to the dish. For dessert, we tried something new - the name escapes me, unfortunately - it featured a blackberry compote, layers of crisp thin sheets of dough, and ice cream. It wasn't too sweet, I liked it more than my friend did. I also ordered a sweet, fruit infused coffee. It was a nice complement to dessert. The only thing that struck me as weird was that they weren't able to add the drinks onto our dinner bill. We had to pay for that separately. Other than that, we had a great time. The wait staff is very friendly. I'd definitely return to try more of the menu!
