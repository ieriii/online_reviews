Well, I am a sucker for all things Belgian (especially beer), so it is only natural that I loved Hopleaf. At first, I was a bit turned off by the huge crowds in the smoke filled bar, but my trusty companion and I were able to snag a booth and peruse the menu while we waited for our table and enjoyed a beer (or two). I understand from regulars that the menu is always changing, but I trust that the Belgian-style mussels and frites are a staple. It was my first experience with mussels, and they were delicious!  I'm glad that we went for one of the special appetizers, which was an interesting combination of pate mousse with fig compote and pistachios served with raisin bread toasts. It was a taste sensation!  We also tried the goat-cheese and lentil croquette, which was essentially a falafel sandwich. It was good, but not as outstanding as the rest of the meal.  We were too stuffed to venture into dessert territory, but I will definitely save room on my next trip.
