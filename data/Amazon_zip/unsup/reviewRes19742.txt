Ya know...I dug it. Especially if you are lunching on work's dollar. I had a burger - it was really good. But, I think the atmosphere does it for me. Its got a lot more character than most nicer loop lunch spots. Not sure if I'd come downtown just to eat here, unless I was entertaining out-of-towners and we were in the vicinity.  Definitely a fresh, fun option for an nicer (I wouldn't call it upscale bc its basically a bar with a great menu - gastropub? Is that what the foodies are calling these joints now?) lunch - either business related or one of those boss-taking-you-out-for-your-bday lunches.
