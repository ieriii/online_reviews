Dinner tonight with a business associate.....very impressed with the setting...not completely 'sure' about the communal tables...fortunately we were 'at the end' and could position our coats and briefcases to give a little space. Great beer menu....good selection altho a little light, for me, on USA craft beers...not to be overly trendy, but that is were the action is these days. On the other hand, the ones chosen were good stuff....Two Brothers; Three Floyds; etc...well done there. Ah yes, the food.....no problem with the quality....all of the treatments were very well done...the corns and the beets...ah, the beets...were excellent...and local...names cited for where the beets and all veggies, and, for that matter, all the foods came from. Good to see Nichols Farm in Marengo represented. The tapas concept was good, no excellent...but I felt a little cheated by the quantities....we spend more or less $150 including tip, and okay we had 5 beers between us (but none of the $25 Belgiums) and I am a little hungry 3 hrs later.... but...but....all in all, both of agreed it was a great experience and will be back with our wives...
