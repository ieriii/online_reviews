This place fills up fast and doesn't take reservations so make suer y ou allow for that. My friends and I had a great evening. The staff is friendly and listen to your waiter on what to order. We ordered things we wouldn't have and loved them. Their Roastes Squash/Ferro/Goat cheese salad sounds awful but it's AMAZING. I loved every bite. The Focaccia di Recco was like no Focaccia I have ever had. So good. We had the pizza with mushrooms and truffle oil - which was great and their ravioli with spinach which was also yummy. We also had an egg casserole type thing that some of us liked some didn't. They have a great wine list and a daily infused vodka. Mine was melon and it was Incredible. If you get a dirty martini they stuff their own blue cheese olives too. Their chocolate dessert was AMAZING! I could have eaten 5 of them. The place is bigger than you think from the outside but not too many tables. Be patient. Also they were filming us for 190 North - so check it out Jan 30th! we are the happy wine drinking folks. I definately would go back, Good food, Nice atmosphere, not too pricey! A great night out.
