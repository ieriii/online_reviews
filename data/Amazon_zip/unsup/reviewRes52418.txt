I celebrated Valentine's day at Brazzaz last night using a Groupon I purchased back in December. I lived in Brasil for a little under a year so this type of cuisine has a special place in my heart. First off, the service was great. We felt like we were being waited on by 5-6 people and never had to wait more than a couple of minutes for anything. We were a little turned off when one of the waitresses snagged our wine glasses before giving us sufficient time to decide if we were going to have any, but that was really the least of my worries. The salad bar was wonderful and fresh. I appreciate the fact that they frequently change out the small portions so that everything from the asparagus to the sushi is at the perfect temperature and flavor. The meat is ultimately what you pay so much for at a place like this (around $48 per person) but it's a steakhouse, so what do you expect? There are 12-14 cuts of meat to choose from cooked at medium to medium rare temperatures with the addition of grilled shrimp and pineapple. You can choose to accept or politely decline any meat you want. All of the meat we had was juicy, tender, and extremely tasty. Very satisfying. For dessert I chose a classic Brazilian "Papaya Cream" which was the perfect ending to a sweet Valentine's day meal. Although it's a huge space, intimate dining is still possible. This is definitely not your "once a week" restaurant, but it's perfect for special occasions.
