i went to wishbone before i read all the reviews...it wasn't as bad as i thought it was according to the negative things some people wrote. the service wasn't slow when it came to getting our food but once we received our food, our waiter seemed to have forgotten about us. i glanced over at him hoping to catch his attention. he started to walk towards us and i thought,"great! he saw me looking towards him and knows we need something." i was wrong. he came towards us to refill the next table's water. i had to get his attention by saying,"excuse me." i hate doing that. anyway, i didn't know that brunch went until after 2pm. i was hoping to order some etouffee (i don't even know if that's on the menu). but all there was to order was breakfast stuff. oh well. the breakfast burrito i ordered was alright but if i do go back another time i want to try their biscuits and gravy.  even if the food wasn't amazing the restaurant itself is interesting and i think people should at least check it out. but i'm sure there are tastier places to eat southern cooking.
