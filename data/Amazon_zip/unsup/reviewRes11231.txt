Any place that serves $7 Bloody Marys so large that I could wash my hair in one is just fine by me. I always take out-of-town friends here, and the Bongo Room always impresses. The Chocolate Tower French toast is sublime, and don't be fooled, the $6 two egg, hashbrowns and chicken sausage plate is massive for the price, especially if you're looking to do brunch, cure a hangover and forget about the fact that you spent most of your paycheck on champagne cocktails the night before. Their eggs bennies are really good, if pricey, and yes, everything on the menu is over-the-top delicious and over the top-calorie wise as well. But if you're one of those painfully dull human beings that has to be a bore and order an egg-white omelette when everyone else is slurping up hollandaise, you don't deserve the Bongo.
