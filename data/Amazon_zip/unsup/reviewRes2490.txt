If you have yet to visit Hot Doug's do so. It'll be a refreshing experience. Their hot dogs are like nothing I've ever had before. First visit here the line was slightly out the door, it went by fast. I was pleased to see the owner, Doug, working the counter. I ordered the Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage with Truffle Aioli, Foie Gras Mousse and Fleur de Sel and duck fries: D-E-L-I-C-I-O-U-S!! (for a hot dog) I had a bit of my friend's hot dog (sorry I forgot the name), it also was really good. After my friend and I quickly devoured our food. We glanced at the line and then looked at each other. We went for round two. We each got a different hot dog from the Specials. Everything we ordered was finger-licking good! I will definitely be going back! NOTE: Duck fries are only served Friday & Saturday. Only open until 4pm & Closed Sundays.
