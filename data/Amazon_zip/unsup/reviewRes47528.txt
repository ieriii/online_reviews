Ok, I have three words to describe their weekend buffet: Oh. My. God. I just went there yesterday to close out my weekend long birthday festivities and it was the perfect end to the weekend. Everything on the buffet was amazing. The set up is similar to Fogo de Chao, in that there is a buffet with salads, (both gourmet and basic) fruits, oatmeal, french toast, cheeses, meats and the list goes on. Then when you return to your table you put a stone by your plate to signal to the table side chefs that you are ready to choose from a variety of succulent meats. In addition, they bring to the table a plate of the best smoked bacon I think I have ever tasted in my life, a frittata, and an huge cinnamon roll to share. All of these were just as awesome as everything else. Be sure to pace yourself at the buffet, as others have mentioned, because it is easy to fill up at the salad bars. To top off the food, this place has some of the best service I think I have ever experienced. The service here was so efficient and genuine that it surpassed service that I have received at some 5 star restaurants I have visited. I totally fell in love with each and every table side chef and all of the servers. The chef came out and wished me a happy birthday and I was later surprised by a plate of desserts with a candle and "Happy Birthday" written in chocolate. Clearly, I could go on and on about this place. But, if you are a foodie like I am, you would be doing yourself a disservice by not going to their buffet THIS WEEKEND! One last thing, like others also mentioned, the rooftop=AWESOMENESS!
