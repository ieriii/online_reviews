Recommended by our hotel parking attendant, Wallace, for a real taste of Chicago's famous deep dish pizza pie. We ordered while we waited for a table (cosmos in hand, of course) - thin crust mushroom & pepperoni and deep dish spinach. The service was friendly and efficient, and the food delicious. We left with leftovers, of course, which weighed about 5 lbs! Seriously, one pizza pie could feed at least 2 people...we sang "It's amore" all the way home!
