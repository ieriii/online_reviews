Had the Bacon and Potato pizza here and its wasn't bad. Wish there was more sauce on it as it was a little dry. But the crust was good and it was spiced nicely. I'll just ask for more sauce next time. The beer here is pretty damn good here I'll admit that, that's the advantage of an on-site brewery I'm sure. Was impressed with the service as well, which was a nice surprise considering this place is seemingly always overcrowded with your Wicker Park hipsters and folks from outside the neighborhood as well. I'll be back and get the pizza extra saucy next time. Just like the 3 star yelp rating says this place is A-OK with me.
