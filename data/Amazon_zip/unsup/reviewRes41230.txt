Ruth's Chris is phenomenal in every way! The food is amazing. You have to order a filet. It comes out sizzling on a plate of butter. The garlic mashed potatoes, au gratin potatoes, shoestrings and au gratin broccoli are all fabulous too. Their desserts are to die for. I always leave uncomfortably full because I cannot stop eating when I'm here. One time when I was here, I had a taste for Mike's Hard Lemonade and asked the waitress if they served it. She apologized and said no, so I ordered something different. Minutes later, she showed up at the table with a bottle of Mike's Hard Lemonade! She sent a staff member to the nearby liquor store to buy it for me! Everyone here consistently goes above and beyond and it does not go unnoticed. I've never had a bad experience and recommend Ruth's Chris to everyone. Sit in the booths along the windows by the bar. I feel like those are the best seats in the house!
