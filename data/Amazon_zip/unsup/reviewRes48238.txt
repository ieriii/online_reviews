I have been here twice, second time was better than the first. The only wish I have is for them to put cushioned seats, padded walls, or something to muffle the noise a little. Concrete floors and wooden tables make for a noisy dining experience. You really have to yell to hear the person across the table. Things to order: You can't go wrong with some chicharron aka fried pork skins and a good beer. (Zepyr is my fav). Shrimp and fried grits. Can i say O.M.G? yeah, O.M.G. Fried clams were pretty tasty This time we ordered a cusscus (that is their spelling) with rabbit sausage, beef tongue, and duck. This was one of my favorite dishes of the night! There was literally one bite of couscous that no one could stomach, so I packed it up!. Yeah, I wont let that go to waste!
