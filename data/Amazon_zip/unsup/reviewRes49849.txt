ATTENTION!!! DO NOT GO TO THIS RESTAURANT EVER AGAIN!!! I have witnessed really bad service, but Las Tablas is by far the worst. I made a reservation to go there on a Wednesday at 8pm. The restaurant called me at 4pm to confirm the reservation, which I did. I was getting ready to go with my relatives and friends (8 people) and then I received a called from the restaurant saying that they were closed for the night. I asked them why and they said that it was very slow for them and they will be better off just closing the kitchen,cancelling reservations and sending everybody home. I asked to talk to the manager and they said that he was gone as well. They did not offer an apology or anything else to compensate this outrageous attitude. I think we should give them a lesson and never visit this place again. Who do they thing they are? The best place in Chicago? Visit El Llano, it is the same food or better, half the price, and you can bring your own bottle anyday, not only Monday to Wednesday.
