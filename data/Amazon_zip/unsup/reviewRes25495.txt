Start with five stars for the cutest store/restaurant ever! Now subtract one star for brusque, inattentive service. Then subtract another star for Greek food that is really "meh" and unremarkable. And then--Opa!-- you have Artopolis, a place that leaves you thinking: "Damn, I wish we had just gone to Pegasus or Greek Islands and got a big delicious lunch that tasted good, with friendly service."
