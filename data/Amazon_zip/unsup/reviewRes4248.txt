Great jazz bar. Honestly, even as overcrowded as it was, it didn't take away from my experience. There's a $12 cover. I think we stayed and watched a set or two. The group they had that night was superb. It's also great that the crowd is always engaged in the performance. A must visit if you're seeking jazz bar entertainment.
