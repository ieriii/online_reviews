I love this place. As a restaurant, it's fantastic. As a bar, it's fantastic (maybe a little crowded). I love craft beer, especially belgian. This place is a temple of belgian beer. The selection includes so many rare beers. It takes a while to deal with the beer menu. The restaurant does top-notch belgian comfort food, and the kitchen is open fairly late. I can't recommend this place enough. It's one of my favorites.
