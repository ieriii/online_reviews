Fun atmosphere for lunch with friends, alone, or a date with a sense of adventure. We ordered six dishes, sat on high chairs at a communal table, ordered a glass of wine each and enjoyed beyond belief! We ordered ... Salt-Roasted Beets with Whipped Goat Cheese & Pistachio Vinaigrette (5 stars) Braised Baby Artichokes, Fingerling Potatoes, Asiago & Salami Toscana (5 stars) Calamari with Fregola, Radishes, Cucumbers & Pistachios (5 stars) Pork Neck Bone Gravy with Ricotta (4.5 stars but OMG!!!) Jimmy's House Made Italian Sausage with Braised Escarole & Cannellini Beans (4+) Chicken Thigh Kebabs, Fried Smashed Potatoes & Tzatziki (3.5) and 4 different glasses of white wine, all of which were well appreciated with no complaints (although a little pricey - $10 to $16) Oh what a feeling!!!!
