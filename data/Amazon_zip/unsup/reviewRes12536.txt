I went on opening night of the NCAA tournament because it was on the bar brackets in the Red Eye.  We got there at 8:30 and the host said it was going to be 45 minutes. The host took our name and said they would find us when our table was available. We ended up getting a spot at the bar, but I did see the host seating other customers from memory, so I guess it works. The bar area is larger, so people are able to wait comfortably without bumping into one another. There are a few tvs in the bar, so we were able to watch all of the games while we ate and drank. We got a seat at the bar and the bartenders were friendly and attentive. The beer was unique and very good. The pizza was thin crust. It had a good amount of toppings. It was a little soggy in the middle, but the crust was very crispy and enjoyable. It was the type of pizza you can fold in half and eat.  It didn't have many decorations but the unique and fun friendly people made the restaurant great.  Overall it was an enjoyable expreience and I will go back.
