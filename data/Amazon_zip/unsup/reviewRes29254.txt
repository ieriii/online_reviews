I would say if you like Mexican cuisine, Frontera has got to be at the top of your list. That isn't fair though because Frontera is just some of the best food you can find in Chicago period. Everything I've ever had here, including their amazing cocktails, was delicious. My best experiences were always seated at the bar and if you order a round of appetizer's as a meal (like I do) it is actually pretty inexpensive.
