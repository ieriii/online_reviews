The hubs and I dined here for Father's Day brunch. A little disappointing. The front room is beautiful with lots of natural light....but the never ending stream of techno music really got on our nerves after a while. Hubs loved his Bloody Mary. The menu was a bit lackluster. Why is everything in "quotations?" The server provided little to no explanation, and was really hard to find for drink refills, etc. I had the "biscuits and gravy": the biscuits were actually little dumplings that unfortunately tasted too much of baking powder. The sausage in the dish was very tasty. Because of a dairy allergy (which apparently the chef can't work around and adjust dishes accordingly), Hubs only had the option of the sturgeon "lox platter." Kind of boring, not worth $16. Chef Dale was seen leaning on the bar throughout our meal and lurking at the host station. Dale, get back into the kitchen and get rid of the quotation marks. Food doesn't have to be so overly complicated.
