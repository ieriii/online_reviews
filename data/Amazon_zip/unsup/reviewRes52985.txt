I really enjoyed the food and service at 90 Miles Cuban Cafe. My boyrfriend and I are unfamiliar with Cuban cuisine, so it was a totally new experience for both of us. I was in comfort food mode and after eating pot roast all weekend, I was ready for a change. I ended up getting the chorizo burger with the garlicky yuca fritas. My burger came out wrong at first, but that was quickly remedied as mentioned below. The yuca frita.....was little bites of garlic heaven for me. As far as the service, let me just say that if I had servers as friendly as the guy who took care of us everywhere the world would be a better place. Not only did he encourage us to take our time and relax, but when my chorizo cheeseburger came out sans cheese and overcooked, he didn't hesitate to get me a new order done right & fast.  Good food, really good service makes me feel all warm & fuzzy inside. I will definitely be back here again.
