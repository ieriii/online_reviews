How Do I Love Thee, Violet Hour? Let me count the ways. I love thee to the depth, breadth, and height My cocktail cravings can reach, when feeling out of sight. For the ends of the Lady Grey, Aviation, and Juliet & Romeo. I love thee to the level of everyday's Most quiet need, by thy velvet blue curtains, high-backed seats, and soft candelight. I love thee freely, as mixologists strive for Right; I love thee purely, as they turn from Vodka. I love thee with a passion put to use In my old tastes, and with my former ignorance of cocktails. I love thee with a love I seemed to lose when I traversed to other cocktail lounges -- I love thee with the spirits, aromatic bitters, and egg whites of all my life! And if fate choose, I shall love thee better when I someday return to this city. VH, I miss you already!
