I went there a week ago to celebrate a friends birthday. We sat at the bar area and have absolutely nothing to complain about Mastros. We ordered some filets and the double porterhouse. Absolutely amazing. Great service and the atmosphere at the bar is great whether you go for dinner or just for drinks after work.
