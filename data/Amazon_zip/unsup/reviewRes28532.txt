My baby took me here for my birthday and it was a total surprise. We were sat immediately and I have to admit I was a bit intimidated by the menu. Fortunately our server was great. We tried the fois gras lollipop with pop rocks which was very funny to eat, if not altogether the most delicious thing I've ever had. Still it was worth the novelty. We had their sampler menu which was five courses. The deconstructed Caesar salad was great and the pumpkin soup was one of the best bowls of soup I've ever had. If I had a bone to pick with this place it would be value for dollar. When we left, we actually went to Taco Bell because my girlfriend was still hungry. I was full, but I think for the money we spent I was disappointed we both weren't. I've spent the same at similar top end restaurants and they had to roll me out the door. All in all I would recommend this place because it's an experience you will certainly enjoy and not soon forget. However, I don't see myself coming back anytime soon. The city is full of new places to explore, and there's nothing here that hooked me enough to bring me back in the door. Unless you're treating that is.
