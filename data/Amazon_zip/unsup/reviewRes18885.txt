Delicious, ungreasy tortas with premium ingredients-- SO GOOD! The bread, the meat, the fixin's -- everything was yummy and fresh. The place seats only about 20-30 people, so expect a long wait if you dine in. Both times I went (once at 8 p.m. on Friday and once at 2 p.m. on Saturday), I had to wait 20-40 minutes before ordering, plus another 10 minutes for the food. Between the food's tastiness and the friendly staff, though, I didn't mind waiting too much. I recommend: - Pepito (braised shortribs, caramelized onion, Jack cheese, black beans, and pickled jalapenos) - Ahogada (pork carnitas, black beans, spicy arbol chile sauce, and pickled onions in the torta, which is served in a tomato broth) - Churros I didn't care much for the hot chocolate or the optional chocolate dipping sauce accompaniment to the churros-- it wasn't the typical sweet chocolate I was expecting and was too bitter. XOCO is CLOSED on SUNDAYS, so plan accordingly!
