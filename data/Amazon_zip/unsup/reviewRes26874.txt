When some friends from CA came to visit they wanted to try the famous Chicago deep dish pizza so I scoured the internet for the best of the best. I chose Pequod's because the crust sounded special and it was clearly thought to be in the top 5. I wasn't disappointed. We went on a crowded Saturday night and they were all over handling the crowd. It didn't really take long to get seated and the waiter was very good. We enjoyed some brew and waited for our delicious pizzas. Mine was a vegan version (no cheese) and delicious. I would love love it if they had vegan cheese though. Oh well, beggars can't be choosers. The atmosphere was very bar-like and laid back. Fun and loud but not too loud. I will definitely be back!
