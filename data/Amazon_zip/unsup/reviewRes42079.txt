Went here with my girlfriend on a thursday night slightly after 12:00 it was pretty empty and we sat upstairs because we wanted to eat. The hours say it is open till 2, but they stop serving food at 12:00 so that was mildly annoying but they still let us order. My gf ordered the brownie and ice cream which was reasonably priced and delicious. I got the steak tartar, and it was so good that i ordered it again so i had two steak tar tars in one night. Our waiter was super friendly and excited and really seemed like he loved his job so that is major bonus points from me. All in all a little slow customer wise but good food, accommodating, nice atmosphere, and good value for what it is.
