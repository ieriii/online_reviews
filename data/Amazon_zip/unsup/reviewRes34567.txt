This place was great!!! I spent the weekend downtown w/ my wife and we were looking for some fun/good/affordable places downtown to eat at. I saw this place online and it generally got good reviews. We were staying at the Hilton Chicago on Michigan Ave (yeah Priceline!) and wanted some places nearby to eat at since it was February and freezing. Yolk has GREAT food at decent prices. Some of the frittatas, omelets, etc were a lil high in price ($8-$9.99), but the food was very good and cooked exactly as I requested (no jalepenos, egg whites, light on cheese). The ambience is great. It was busy both times we went there (breakfast on Sunday and lunch on Monday), but the wait times weren't too long and it went quick. Service speed was amazing as well. I ordered a grilled chicken sandwich w/ bacon, avocado, swiss on a sourdough bread, and my wife ordered some french toast. We had the food within probably 5-8 minutes. I'd highly recommend this place to anyone!
