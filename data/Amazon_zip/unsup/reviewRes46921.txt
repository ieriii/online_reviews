Ok, first the bad news, right? My girlfriend took me here for my birthday dinner and we hadn't tried the place before. It was a Saturday night and we got there a little after 8 with no reservations. We didn't mind waiting and the hostess said it would only be 5-10 minutes, so we had a seat in the bar area where she directed us. About 20 minutes later, I went up and asked how much longer and her response was, literally, "Oops! I totally forgot about you guys!" So, after waiting another 10-15 minutes, we were finally sat. That's the bad news. For the good news... We got the best seat in the house. Even though they crammed a lot of tables into the small space, we luckily were seated right in front of the fireplace. It was romantic and somehow felt secluded. I ordered one of their fancy martinis, called the Tree-Tini. They apparently plant a tree for each one ordered. The bar tender came over and hand mixed it at the table, which was pretty cool. The waitress was quite nice and gave some good suggestions, including the calamari. And it was delicious. I'm quite the calamari critic and this was one of the best I've had. Yum. For the main course, my lady and I got the cod and the steak and both were FANTASTIC. It was one of the most flavorful steaks I've ever had. Even though we were both stuffed, we had to have dessert (birthday, remember?). We had the chocolate cake with pumpkin gelato. It was pretty good although the rest of the meal was so outstanding that the plain chocolate cake didn't have a chance to "take the cake." Haha, get it?! Take the Cake?!?! Geez, sometimes I can be so funny, er, punny. Man, there I go again... Anyway, the only reason that this place didn't get 5 stars is because of the flaky hostess. But we will DEFINITELY be back again and again.
