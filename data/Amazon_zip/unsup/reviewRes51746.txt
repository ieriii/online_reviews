I have been going to Garcia's for a long time and have only eaten here a handful of times. That's way too many cause it's been years since I have been here and I went there today for lunch. I just ordered a 2 taco special( carne Asada with rice and beans). First of all, after the waitress brought us our chips and salsa and drinks and took our order, she was never to be seen again. She never came by to check on us or even to refill our water. After we finished eating, we waited and waited for her to come around to wrap our food to go and get our check but nothing. I tried to wave down another waiter but he just bypassed me without looking. Finally I was able to waive another waitress down and asked her to wrap our food up and get the check. She came right away. This is what has happened to me the few times I have been to this place. The food is good but the service is awful. My waitress never came around. I gave it two stars only because the food is alright.
