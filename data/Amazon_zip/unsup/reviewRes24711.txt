If we could give half ratings, we'd rate this a 3.5. The experience and ambience were fantastic- very low lighting and quite romantic (perfect for any special occasion!). However, the food was only average and nothing out of the ordinary. We each ordered a premiere fondue dinner, which included salad, cheese fondue, chocolate fondue, and coffee (not latte). The cheese fondue was pretty good and tasted wonderful with the fruit. The entree comes out on one big platter. On first looks, you would not think that it's a lot of food...but trust me you will get full since it is a slow dining experience. Between the two of us, we were able to sample everything except the chicken. The scallops were, in our opinion the best. I supposed the lobster would have been good also. Too bad we overcooked it each and every time! The entrees come with 10 different dipping sauces. I cant remember them all, but pay attention when your server makes suggestions because the suggested pairings are actually pretty good. The flaming chocolate fondue was a great way to top of dinner. The best part were the marshmallows! So, in conclusion: 5 stars for the GREAT service and experience, but only 3.5 for the pricey, average food. If I come back, it would be for the experience, scallops, and roasted marshmallows.
