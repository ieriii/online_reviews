Stayed over the Christmas Holiday this year! This place is HOT! Friendly helpful service! Upgraded to a suite with a great view! Had some family over for pre dinner drinks and appetizers, room service was fast and efficient and the food recommendations were out of this world! I highly recommend the W-Lakeshore when in Chicago!
