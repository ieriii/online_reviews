My relationship with Belgian beer began with a relationship with a Belgian man. Through him, I learned about the tradition of brewing in Belgium, the pride and high regard Belgians have for their beer, and the art of enjoying a special brew in a special glass. The relationship didn't last, but my appreciation and affection for the beer remains. There are few places in Chicago that honor the uniqueness of beer from all over the world, and Hopleaf is high on my list. I only wish I could get there more often! Go to Hopleaf, and if I'm not there, have a lambic for me.
