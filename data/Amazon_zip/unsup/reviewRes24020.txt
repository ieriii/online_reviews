It used to be a LOT better....But today, I was greeted by a very unprofessional and unfriendly waitress, who barely even took the effort to look at me when she thanked me for coming. The Aziz crepe, used to be my favorite, tasted like hide, the fruit inside were stale and it was drenched in Nutella, so much that I couldn't taste anything else. For $8.50, I could buy two jars of Nutella and it would have been better money spent. Very disappointing, to say the least. I hope the managers take note, because this used to be my favorite crpe cafe in Chicago.
