This is coming from having worked at Coast Sushi more than it is from knowing what good sushi is.  The restaurant is hip. It looks slick. Expect to wait for your table and expect to wait for your food during peak dinner hours. Prepare for a drunken frenzy in the waiting room on Friday nights, yuppies are shoulder to shoulder, and you can hardly hear. The servers are young and cool. The sushi is flavorful, colorful, and presented nicely.  My favorite roll I've tried is the Coast Crab. BYOB!
