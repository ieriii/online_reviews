Wow. My overall impression of Zed451 is "wow." I must say, there are few restaurants in Chicago as striking as Zed451 is from the *outside*. The design and architecture inside would lend itself to the back woods just as well as it does to the middle of the city. Once I reached the roof deck, I couldn't help but be amazed that this restaurant exists in the middle of Chicago. The food itself was very good. Their "harvest tables," which are a sort of up-scale salad bar, provide a wealth of tasty options and I have to say these dishes were my favorites for the evening. In particular there was a salad with rhubarb that was amazing. The meats for the most part were very well prepared and most were marinated or served with a sauce. There were a few pieces of meat that I thought were too tough or dry for my own taste. As far as service goes, I wouldn't complain. The staff was friendly and we were well attended to. On occasion we waited what seemed like a long time for a Brazilian-style steakhouse before someone returned with more meat but I actually thought it was nice to pause between rounds and let my food settle a bit. Kudos to the folks at Zed451 (and my date) for a fine evening!
