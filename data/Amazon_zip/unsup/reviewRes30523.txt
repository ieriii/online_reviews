I took my husband and my mother-in-law here for my husband's birthday. The service throughout the whole dinner was inpeccable. My mom loved her bone-in filet and my husband went crazy over his 32oz australian wagyu tomahawk ribeye (http://www.yelp.com/biz_). In addition, the wine was some of the best I ever had. Dessert was the chocolate cake on the house and my husband really enjoyed it. He said that the meal was in the top 3 of his favorites. Dinner is pricey but if you want a great experience for a celebration, this is a place that delivers. Thank you Mastro's in your help for having my husband have an extraordinary birthday!
