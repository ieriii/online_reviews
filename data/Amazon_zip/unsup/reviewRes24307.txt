My bf and I had Mercat's breakfast 3 times during our 5-day stay in downtown Chicago. Part of this was due to the convenience (Mercat is located in the Renaissance Blackstone Hotel, where we were staying), and part of this was due to the deliciousness of the food here. We were able to arrange breakfast deliveries to our hotel room. Being woken up by Mercat's Blackstone Eggs Benedict was like heaven. The meal consisted of tender chorizo and perfectly poached eggs in a savory, creamy sauce. The toasted brioche soaked up all the deliciousness. The crispy breakfast potatoes were fabulous too. This was one of the best, if not the best eggs benedict dish I have had. For my 3rd Mercat breakfast, this time at the actual, beautifully-decorated restaurant, I decided to try something different.: steak and poached eggs (http://s3-media4.ak.yelp). The steak was definitely tasty though it could have used some sauce or extra flavor to give it some oomph. I thought it was weird that they didn't have steak sauce. They ran out of biscuits, so I had the delicious brioche again. The sauce for this dish was again, absolutely delicious. The eggs were great except there was a bland, gross, funky tasting extra tiny egg. I'm not sure why they gave me this extra little egg, it made my meal worse. Verdict: Blackstone Eggs Benedict rocks my world, 5 stars for that.
