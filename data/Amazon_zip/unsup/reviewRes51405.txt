Great food at a great price. My only issue was the fact that the menu seemed a little too "run of the mill" for a mexican place, but then again it is Lincoln Square and one must consider the clientele. I got the fish taco dinner and was expecting a kind of diced up fish grilled on a flat grill...NOOOOOOOPE, deliciously fresh whole grilled fillet with avocado and pico on a corn tortilla. Absolutely delicious, and did i mention that 3 people ate for less than $50? This place is worthy of a repeat, nicely done Garcia's
