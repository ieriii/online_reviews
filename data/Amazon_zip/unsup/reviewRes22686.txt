While I was visiting my sister and brother-in-law, they took me here for my first experience with a Chicago hot dog. I was tentative, to say the least, given that my taste for hot dog toppings runs to chili or sauerkraut, but the hot dog turned out to be real tasty. Real tasty indeed. The place also had a cute drive-in vibe. On the other hand, the hot dog bun was soggy, which is a mark against it. Also, it's impossible to get a dog (or a sausage) without fries. You want a sausage and a dog, that's two servings of fries whether you want two servings of fries or not. Since the fries were over-fried and under-flavored, my vote's for "not" on the wanting two servings of fries (or for me, even one serving of fries).
