I've never had anything at Wilde that I didn't like. The ambiance is perfect, and the staff is friendly and knowledgeable. Sunday night Karaoke is a lot of fun as well. Some of my favorites: Atlantic Cod Brittles Mac and Cheese Artichoke Dip Even the house salad with Ranch is amazing. Broadway Buffalo Chicken Fish and Chips Shepards Pie Chocolate Molten Cake
