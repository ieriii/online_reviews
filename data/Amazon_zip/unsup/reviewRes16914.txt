The Violet Hour is one of my new favorite spots in Chicago. I went here for a private whiskey tasting a few months back and fell in love. The decor is of a Victorian parlour with lighting that is to die for. The drinks are just out of this world. The house made syrups and presentation is unlike any I have seen in Chicago or NYC. You know you have found someplace unique when you continually find yourself entranced by decor, people and menu. Highly recommend for lovers of a unique cocktailing experience. Pricey, but worth dropping the money for a fantastic drink and atmosphere.
