Been to Wilde twice and had two different experiences. First time was for breakfast. Had the corned beef hash and loved it. It was a nice day and not very full, so it was a relaxing way to start the day. The decor at this place is really neat and unique. So, it definitely has that going for it. The bar doesn't open until later on Sundays, so no bloodys or mimosas for brunch, but oh well.  It was my second visit that showed me what this place doesn't have going for it. It was about 85 degrees out with 190% humidity and they decided to leave the doors/windows open and the place was packed. So, my girlfriend and I were literally sweating as we ate. So, that's the first problem. The second was that they were blasting party favorites over all of the conversations, so it was too loud for us to even have a conversation across a very small table. The music said "trixie bar", but the atmosphere and clientelle said otherwise. So, that didn't seem to fit either. The food for dinner that night was average. She had the steak and I had the lamb. The steak wasn't nearly as good as the price suggested it would be. Cooked fine, but not very flavorful. The lamb was extremely fatty, so a lot of it went to waste. Not "bad" food, but not great, and certainly not the type of food you want to eat when your sweating. To top it off, I ordered a black and tan (which, contrary to another review on here, is made originally made with Harp, not Bass. So yes, you can get a true black and tan) and when it arrived, it was no longer a black and tan, but more a "blan" as it was mixed by the time it got to me.  So, in short, I would definitely go back for breakfast, and I might give it another try for dinner, but only if they turned the music down and shut the windows on ridiculously hot days.
