Again greetings and salutations to the reader for looking at this review. I became aware of Hot Dougs while watching "No Reservations", as I saw Anthony Bourdain scarf down a hot dog and claim that this place and Chicago had the best Hot Dogs in the country even better than New York., I knew I had to check it out. So away I went and upon arrival for a Thursday the line was out the door, and after a Fifteen minute wait I had arrived at the counter were my order was being taken by Doug himself. This guy was very polite (translation cool) as I ordered my 2 hotdogs grilled( you have a choice grilled or boiled) with everything and fries. So I waited and took a seat my wait was no less than 10 minutes but after tasting this poor mans food masterpiece I was in the thrall and a true believer in the haus die Doug. A fair warning if you dare to venture out to appease your palate, Hot Doug is the place, note if you arrive try for the weekends fore the duck fat fried fries are the rave for regulars and newcomers alike. Bon appetit!
