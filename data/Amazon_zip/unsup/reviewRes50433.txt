This place does amazing things with the pig. I've tried it many, many ways, and they never fail to amaze. I've found the service to be good, leaning towards very good. The atmosphere is nice, if nothing overwhelming. The back patio is indeed a treat, in season. The drinks situation is very good, but the cocktails are needlessly overpriced (although they do make a tasty Sazerac), and the beer selection could be expanded. The real (5)star here is the food. The passion the restaurant has for its ingredients and the possibilities they present--all with a delightful eye on history--has shone forth in every meal I've had there. I had a suckling pig with greens over grits that literally made me cry it was so good. A delightful serving of ham--with greens, cheddar grits and amazing butterbeans--was a close second. Their attention to detail in their food, and their ability to make a stellar relish tray or wonderful pimento cheese, keeps Big Jones in my top-tier of Chicago restaurants.
