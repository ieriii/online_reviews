Probably the best pizza we had in Chicago. Started with their fried ravioli, which were pretty good with a tasty cheese filling. After that, one small deep dish was enough finish us off--primarily because the crust was so dense ("decadent" is probably embellishment). To top it off they had pretty good chocolate chip cookies and brownies for us to take home. The pizzas, of course, take forever to cook. When we got there around 5 or 6 PM, there was no wait. By the time we left, an hour and a half later, there was a line outside waiting to get in. (So consider take out.)
