The rooftop patio alone, increased my review from 3 stars to 4. Relaxing atmosphere that is the place to be on a warm Chicago afternoon, that is, if you can get there early enough to get a spot. The drinks are pricey but good. I tried making reservations for a party of 10 for 4pm on a Friday afternoon and was told there was a $6,500 minimum or some outrageous number so it's hard to arrange for a gathering b/c if the patio is full, you're whole party may not be able to get in if people arrive later.
