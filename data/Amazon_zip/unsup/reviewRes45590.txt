I can honestly say that I have always had a great experience here. Whether it is just to meet up with some friends for drinks, or for dinner, the staff has always been very friendly and helpful. The prices have always been reasonable and the atmosphere has been great. I've never seen it get too crowded, and I seem to get lucky with parking. The only complain I have about this place is that its kind of forgettable. Everything is average. The attentive staff and good prices help this place stand out. I came here to celebrate a friends birthday on Saturday. Between the two of us splitting an appetizer, having two rounds of drinks, entrees, and an appetizer, the bill came out to 80 dollars, way less than I expected for the service and the quality of food we got. Try the toffee pudding and the Purple haze beer. Wow!
