This is a very chic and unique hotel. There are definite pros and cons. Pros: if you book through the hotel you get breakfast vouchers and even if you find a better deal on any online site they will match the price and maybe even upgrade your room. The restaurant had a very good breakfast menu, everything we got tasted great! We got a comfy King room corner view. It is amazing! The ceiling to floor windows are very unique. Make sure you are aware of your surroundings with the adjacent buildings. Keeping your shades up or down when needed. You'll have a great night view too. The floors are half wood and carpet which gives it a homey feel. Shower is awesome! Very chic room overall. All the staff are very attentive and friendly. The concierge helped me surprise my husband with chocolate covered strawberries and a nice bottle of champagne delivered to our room for his birthday. Cons: you hear sirens all day and night!! If you're a light sleeper this is quite annoying. But I guess that's what you get visiting a big city. It's definitely worse than NYC. The walls are a little thin of the room but not bad. Over all I was very impressed with the hotel itself, we will definitely return!!
