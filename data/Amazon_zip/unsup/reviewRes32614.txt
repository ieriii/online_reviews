Sunda has an AMAZING interior.  There is a mysterious and alluring yet comfortably chic aurora to the restaurant. It is absolutely stunning and truly creative. The food, on the other hand, is mediocre. First of all, the lunch menu isn't so attractive. It was hard to find a dish that I wanted to order. I had the longevity noodles and my friend had the chicken and pork adobo. It wasn't terrible, but nothing worth returning for and definitely not worth the high price. Our server wasn't the best, he looked almost grumpy, but maybe that's just what he looks like naturally. Overall, the other servers seemed to be very friendly and attentive. I give this place 3 stars solely because I'm a sucker for unique and creative interior/ambiance. I'd like to return and see what the dinner menu is like.
