I think Carnivale is a good place to get a decent cuisine. The atmosphere is great, I Love Love Love looking around a place i am eating at and seeing every race and age range there is, it makes my heart fuzzy with happiness (love to observe). Slow on service and be careful of the weekends the sluts show up at 10 while the suburban people leave (about inches more then there skirts)
