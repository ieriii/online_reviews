If you've been to a Grand Lux or Cheesecake factory anywhere else, you have been to this place. Traditional american fare is what they offer, and their consistency across all of their locations makes this a great spot. Prices are very reasonable here, and atmosphere is great. One big winner here is the beignets, which are AWESOME!!! Definitely give these a try on your next visit here!
