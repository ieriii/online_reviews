Being from LA, my fiance and I decided to stay in Downtown for a night on one of our recent trips. The city is beautiful and there are a ton of nice restaurants. So why did we go to Nuevo Leon and not The Signature Room? BYOB!!!!! Aside from the fact that the fancy restaurants suck, nothing can compare to Mexican food. Relatives told me that the area where the restaurant is located wasn't too good. It was actually nice in my opinion. Having places like Watts in LA 18th street was actually kinda nice. I had the tampiquena. The meat was ok. Nothing special. But the enchilada with Mole was great! I loved it. The staff was nice The one major downer to this place is that they only take cash. It makes it hard to go all out when many of us only use credit cards for everything. This place was great and an awesome experience with our Victoria Beers! Will definetly go back.
