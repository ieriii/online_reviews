Short & sweet and to the point: Awesome.We came here and had an amazing dinner. Our waiter recommended the chopped avocado on crostini for the app and it was the perfect start to our meal. You get 4 of them--they were SO good! We also got Stella salads which had all my favorites in it--greens with apples and raspberries, provolone, pinenuts in a honey-mustard champagne vinegarette. Our entrees: lobster ravioli and baby back ribs. Both were so tasty. Homemade pasta and fall off the bone ribs--what more can you ask for??Great portion sizes and very satisfying. Dessert was the chocolate raspberry cake which was very rich and and very decadent (I'm not complaining). If you've never been to Sapori and your reading the reviews to see if you should go, stop reading now and just go! You won't be disappointed in this awesome neighborhood Italian restaurant!
