Excellent pizza. I do like their deep dish. Good sauce, not too cheesy. One of the few pizza places where I have cravings for the pizza. I usually get a cheese pizza, or with spinach on it, easy on the cheese. Atmosphere is nothing too special... The table placement is a bit tight, unless you are at one of the tall tables in the front. Beer selection is ok, service is good.
