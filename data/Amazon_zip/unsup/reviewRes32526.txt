Went here for a girlfriends birthday dinner. Had a blast, loved the atmosphere - very live. I had the no you didn't...the ultimate handroll, it was like a Sushi wrap. The firecracker & sunda rainbow roll are very good. Portions are family style and easily shared. The Garlic rice was way too garlicky. Will be going back there. Valet parking was $12 bucks. Make reservations, will not be seated until most of your party is present.
