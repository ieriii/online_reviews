The BEST sword fish I have ever had!!!! Glenn's Diner is great but this was just mouth watering. Something about the sauce that had me savoring each bite. Genuinely one of those meals you just don't want to end. My girlfriend had the lamb kabob which was cooked medium and tasted great. Nice and tender. They also stuff you with so Persian rice which made an excellent combination my swordfish. It was definitely cooked fresh, not reheated. The decor is nice, but not fancy and out waitress was great. I was skeptical about Persian food but this won me over.
