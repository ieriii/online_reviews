I saw this on Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives and decided it was worth a trip into the city. There are a lot of good beers, but the food left something to be desired. I after seeing the brisket featured on the show, I ordered the brisket platter and was treated to about 8 ounces of pretty dry meat. It took a LONG time to get service and for our food to arrive. Beers were brought out within about 1 minute of ordering however. The rest of our food was good, but not amazing. The Mac and Cheese was probably the best thing we had, along with the potato croquettes. Overall, a great place to drink, but service was sub-par and the food is a little disappointing.
