Colorful, vibrant and a total scene this is a Jerry Kleiner restaurant at its best. Whether you're in the mood for a mojito at the bar (I wonder exactly how many of these they make a night? hundreds I'm sure - it is their signature drink) or a lavish dinner, this place is sure to make a memorable night out. The ceviche is a great appetizer to share (choose 3 of the 5 options which is still a big taste) and I was happy with my generous portion size on my sizzling skirt steak served atop black beans and rice. Call me crazy, but the BF and I decided (ok I was tempted) to order the macaroni and cheese. Our waiter totally sold us on it. Would I recommend it? Never. Why is it even on the menu?? I was tempted and couldn't resist. No room for the churros or flan on this visit sadly.
