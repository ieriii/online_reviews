After waiting two hours for a sausage, I expected to leave Hot Doug's in a state of gustatory ecstasy.  Yes the Ubergarlic was delicious, but not in an otherworldly oh-my-god-I'm-in-heaven sort of way. The duck fat fries were a greasy, salty mess; fine if you like that stuff but there are plenty of other places in this city to satisfy that lust. I also found it hard to fork over $8-9 on a single "gourmet" dog when you could walk out with a half dozen of the "plain" ones for the same price.  I'm sure it's the premise of a gourmet dog that will attract most customers here, and the menu is certainly interesting, but don't expect these sausages to change your outlook on life. I also wonder if the exorbitant wait time skews perceptions of these dogs: what doesn't taste good after you've been hungrily waiting in line for 2 hours? If you must check it out, bring something to help kill the time, and beware of the ice cream man who parks next to the line and plays his siren song of "Turkey in the Straw," ruining the appetites of those too weak to wait it out.
