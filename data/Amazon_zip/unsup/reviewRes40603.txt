Now, this isn't fair. I'm not sure which La Pasadita I went to, but it was on the west side of Ashland for sure. I stopped in for some drunken tacos with a friend, and got a little bit of a culture shock. Being new in the neighborhood, I didn't realize how authentic this place would be. As I fumbled through ordering after finding out they have no tostadas, we wait next to the counter for our food. The cooks throw us doggies a bone: a delicious bone of what I now know as barbacoa. Oh my meaty goodness. I felt like I was ravaging the sample they gave us, it was so good. This is definitely the place for drunken tacos, sober tacos, sad tacos, hungry tacos, well, you get it. If you have a taco craving, run, do not walk to La Pasadita. Now, if only I knew whether the other locations have tostadas.
