The last time I was here, it was about to transition from Continental Cafe. Overall, I don't notice a whole lot of difference. Gone are the huge menus with photos of the dishes. That has been simplified to one page of small print. I can't say for certain, but it appears to me that there are fewer selections, now. I had the stuffed cabbage again. They're good. Even better is their creamy polenta. It is the epitome of comfort food. Appetizers we have tried are good. The crab and spinach dip with pita and the eggplant spread are good. For dessert we tried the chocolate ganache filled cupcake and a strawberry cobbler. I wasn't expecting much, but both were quite tasty. Beer and wine selection isn't huge, but decent. I like the strawberry daiquiri's they make. I am a little uncertain of what direction they're going with the menu. I wish they'd stick with the Romanian food. It's worked for them for almost 40 years. The owner, Branko is awesome! He stopped by our table probably 6 times. We've seen him there before, but it's not as if he knows us or anything. He "bought" our third round of drinks, and also gave us a shot of something that I assume is some potent Romanian concoction. Very hospitable guy. Could have done without the roaming father and son accordion/violin duo. I love live music, but I don't dig them stopping at your table unsolicited to perform 2 of the longest songs...in the history of songs. I'm guessing this is more of a late-night and private party spot, because before 9:00, they never seem too busy. Certainly have never had a problem getting a table. Also never have a problem with nearby street parking, and it's not metered...yet. Will be a regular stop, and definitely recommended.
