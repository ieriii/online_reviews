Trekked in the cold night while being bombarded by punishingly freezing rainfall. We got to Crisp soaked and on the verge of catching a cold or even worse.  We weren't in good moods but the chicken wings here... JEEZ ... well that flipped our moods real quick. Seoul Sassy Chicken Wings. So crispy and the marinade was SO F***en good. Oh yeah their other food is good too... but the chicken wings... man I gotta ask them if they put crack in it. It's addicting.
