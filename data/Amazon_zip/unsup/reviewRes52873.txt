Have been to 90 Miles about a half dozen times and it never disappoints. My favorite dishes are the ropa vieja, skirt steak, calamari appetizer (sauce is delicious) and the empanadas (guava and cheese, chorizo - yum!) Eating with two, I suggest getting one entree and trying a few apps. Reserving one star because service usually feels a little rushed or the apps come out after the entree. Works best when ordering courses one at a time so you can enjoy the experience. It's loud, but very fun and a great atmosphere. While you're waiting for a table you can watch the food being cooked right in the entry way. Can't wait to try it in the summer!
