I had the pleasure of dining, just yesterday at this establishment. I found our waiter, Spiro, very polite, and informative about our pizza choices. He made the whole dining experience a pure delight. I am a south sider, but will again travel to the area for another great experience in the near future. We were celebrating my great nephew's Baptism and Spriro made it all the more memorable. Thank you! Mary M. Floyd
