The wait is so worth it. We waited in the cold for forty minutes for a table, but it was worth it. I had the crab cake sandwich and we ordered the almond french toast for the table. Wow describes it correctly. It was so good I just wanted to eat more and more, sadly because of the generous portions that was not a possibility.
