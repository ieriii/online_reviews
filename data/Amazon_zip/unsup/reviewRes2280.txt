dare i say it... the BEST hot dog place in chicago... yes yes i will every wednesday you will find me here at a table stuffing my face in sheer glory with no shame, and every wednesday i have yet to be disappointed by not only the quality of food but the awsome service. yes hot dougs its true im glad we have found eachother.... when you are closed i shed a tear and when you are open i would stand in a line half way down california just for a veggie dog. you complete me.
