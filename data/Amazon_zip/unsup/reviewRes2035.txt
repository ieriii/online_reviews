My mother in law was scandalized to find out that we spent $35 on six hot dogs, an order of fries and a few sodas - and waited in the cold for an hour for the privilege of doing so. Clearly she has never eaten at Hot Dougs - I considered it a bargain given the quality. And Doug himself is as nice a guy as you can find. I'll be dreaming about those duck fat fries for weeks to come. Thank god we timed our visit for the day after I had my cholesterol checked...
