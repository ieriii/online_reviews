This is one of my favorite places to eat. The food is always delicious and interesting. The room has a wonderful plantation feel with dark bamboo and funky tropical ferns. The service is always, always dead on. I would recommend a dish but everything I've eaten here has been great. The upstairs lounge I would describe as upscale tiki. Although we've never sat in the lounge for too long, I always make a mental note to remember this place when I'm looking for a watering hole.
