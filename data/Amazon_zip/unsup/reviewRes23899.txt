Great place for crepes, both salty and sweet. I had the "Build Your Own" with Spinach, tomato tapanade, roasted peppers, avacado, mozzarella, basil, pine nuts, and the Icosium Dressing. Fantastic! I've had better crepes (mine were a bit soggy and difficult to cut), but the combinations of stuffings was definitely unique and everything complemented everything else very well. The meal also came with a soup (choices were either Mushroom or Vegetable, I chose the vegetable) and that was fantastic as well. The soup seemed to be be squash based and did not contain any chunks of vegetables, but it was flavored well and very good. I was there with a couple of other people and we got a good variety of salty and sweet crepes. Everybody enjoyed their food. I am definitely going back to try something else on the menu.
