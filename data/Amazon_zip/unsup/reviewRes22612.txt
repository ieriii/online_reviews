I seldomly eat Greek food, though I love it--and this is my favorite. I'm a fan of the most basic dishes--the Greek salad, the gyros, the skordalia and the tzatziki--and Greek Islands does them well. The restaurant is cavernous, the wait staff runs the gamut from super-attentive and nice to indifferent and unhelpful, and some of the chairs tend towards rickety. But none of that matters when you put that first forkfull of food in your mouth.
