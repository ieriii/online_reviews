I love you, ropa vieja. You are the perfect bite of sweet from your plaintain, savory from your fall apart beef and salty from your aderezo. I will be sure to order you as my main course next time and not have a flirtation with shrimp tacos as I did this last time. I will be faithful to you because you have been so good to me. xoxo
