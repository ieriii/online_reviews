Stopped in to get some churros y chocolate after dinner at Topolo and this was well worth skipping the goat's milk and other odd offerings next door! The churros were freshly made and something like $1 a piece - YUM! Well worth the 10 minute wait. They were wrapped in a handly paper sack with cinnamon and chocolate shavings as well! Chocolate that the husband got was the watered-down offering, which was not my thing (I would have opted for the one with almond milk - yummy).
