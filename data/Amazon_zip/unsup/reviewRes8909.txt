My wife and I are heading up north to the Albany Park area to take our oldest son back to his college. We swing by the Lincoln Square area to pickup our oldest daughter so we can all head out for a nice afternoon lunch. We all agree to try out Noon O Kabab. The place is beautiful inside. We just love all the tile mosiac art pieces. The chairs at our table are padded and so comfortable. The service is extremely friendly and attentive. First we order the Hummus for our appetizer. This was just ok, nothing really special. Knowing that Semiramis (another restaurant I have reviewed earlier) is just over the tracks, less than a block away, I am longing for their Hummus which was outstanding! We also ordered the Saffron Chicken soup which was truly tasty. The soup had so much flavor and was really fresh and good. Then for our main course the four of us each order the Barb Kabab, a thin fillet minon with rice and grilled tomatoes. Maria and my son got the white rice with saffron. My daughter and I got the dilled rice with saffron. We all thought our main course was again just average, nothing special to write home about. We did all agree though that the white rice was better than the dilled rice. Finally for dessert Maria ordered the Baklava. She said she "loved it". She thought it was very fresh. Overall we did think the pita bread was good. And the tea was very flavorful. But the price tag seemed very high. Our bill came to roughly $86 dollars. Would we go back or recommend Noon O Kabab, maybe if we ordered a different main course item the next time.
