Wakamono always had great Sushi, but they have the WORST SERVICE out of any Sushi Restaurant in the City! We waited 2 Hours for a Table on a Saturday night after being told it would take about 45 minutes. We received the Bill with a $16 corkage fee for the bottle of wine we had brought. I asked to speak to the Manager, politely asking what she could do for me because of the extremely long wait. She explained that everyone waited about 2 hours and would not even take an app off of the bill. When I asked to speak to the Owner or another manager she yelled at the table saying she was in Charge. I used to love Wakamono, but there are a lot of Sushi Restaurants in walking distance. VERY OVERRATED..... WORST SERVICE....
