I stayed at the Westin for a weekend, and couldn't have been happier. I was located in a corner room overlooking the river, which I highly recommend you request, and was very impressed with the quality of my stay. They have a nice bar for early or late night cocktails (or day), and the on site restaurant which serves up a tasty breakfast. Well within walking distance from all the action, and across the street from the House of Blues, its a good pick while in Chicago.
