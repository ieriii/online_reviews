The plan was to try to walk in to Girl and the Goat and have this as a backup. Turns out GATG was closed on labor day, so we had no choice but to go here. Was FAR from disappointed. Great atmosphere, cool lighting, family style seating but also some funky private booths with their own doors. Here's what we ate: Blood Sausage: RICH, but not too rich like blood sausage can be. Great way to kick things off. Grilled Octopus: one of my favorite dishes ever. Served on a pancake. Yea, a pancake. Unreal. Corn side: Sweet, and covered with delicious white cotija-ish cheese. SO good, but I'm a sucker for corn. Roast chicken and summer sausage: One of their signature dishes. It was delicious for sure, but not mind-blowing. Best part was the fries soaked in the 'jus'. Lots of food for your dollar, but I'd try something more unique next time. Beer: amazing selection. We settled on a sour belgian 700ml that looked like a champagne bottle. Even had 'Cuvee' in the name. So good.
