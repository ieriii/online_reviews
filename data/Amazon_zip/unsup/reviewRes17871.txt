We came here after the Half Acre brewery tour so we were a little/lot buzzed. First I will say that I love burgers like every other half blooded american. This place did not disappoint. In fact I can't believe that I have lived in this city 3 years and have not been here yet. You can tell that the beef patty was of high quality and it was cooked to perfection (medium rare), full of juices and flavor. I got curry fries as a side and they were perfectly cooked, although I didn't really appreciate the statement of curry flavored fries. I had the "Frenchie" burger which was brie, frizzled onions, truffle mayo. One of the best burgers in the city. Blows Kuma's corner away easy. I'm putting this place at the top of my list next to DMK. Beer menu is outstanding and all the food/drink was fairly priced. Wait staff was excellent.
