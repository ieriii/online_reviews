If you are a vegetarian, do NOT go to this place. I asked the waiter if there was cheese in the marianara sauce (there was) so I decided just to have a baked potato. The waiter then proceeded to get into an argument with me, telling me he and his family had eaten meat their entire lives, and that vegetarians "were what is wrong with the world today". It took about 5 minutes of berating before he finally accepted that I wasn't going to order anything else. I've never experienced such bad service, ever. The place is also extremely overcrowded, with waiters bumping into one another and patrons of the restaurant, even while carrying food that's on fire. One even dropped a lit sparkler on the carpet. I definitely would not recommend going to this place.
