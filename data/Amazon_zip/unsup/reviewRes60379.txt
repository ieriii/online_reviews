I NEVER have been treated this way from any restaurant!!!OK. I went to this Giordanos today March 16th. Me and my three friends ordered lots of stuff and the food was great. And the service was OK. We got the check and paid with cash and credit card. We wanted change back on the cash but our server comes back with uncorrect change. So we explained about the miscalculation but she didn't get it the first time. Later she got it and went to get correct change. THEN a guy comes back and the first thing he says " whose card is this? sign this. Sign this and then go"  WTF? We were happily talking until then and this manager guy comes and tells us to leave without explanation about miscalculated change? Whoa! watch your attitude! That manager guy stood until my friend signed and took the receipt right away and left. We got soooooooo mad instantly at his attitude because there is no reason to hear "sign and go" (I assure you that we hardly made any noise while we were eating) and it was HIS miscalculation of the cash change. (Our server told us that he the manager gives change to the servers)  Four of us got very mad and went to front side and talked with the other manager. He was lightly apologizing and then he says " what do you want me to do? we are busy"     unbelivable... What do you think we want? just one sincere apology from the other manager. It was pointless talking to those people so we just left.I would of course NEVER EVER go back there and maybe I would never go eat at any other Giordanos. They hire horrible managers
