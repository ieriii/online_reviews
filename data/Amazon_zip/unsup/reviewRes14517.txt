Love this place! The food never disappoints. The only negative is that when you have a reservation they are very rigid about where you sit, On two different occasions, I was dining with one friend and there were 2 (2) seater tables, in both cases, we asked for the other table which was away from door traffic and they wouldn't switch. Not a huge deal but my only complaint about them. Overall the food is fabulous.
