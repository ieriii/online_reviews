Really enjoyed our experience at GB! You have to try the balsamic, roasted garlic, olive oil dipped in toast. Dipping sauce heaven! It doesn't stop there. I decided on plain old grilled chicken, but GB elevated this chicken to an out of this world level. And the portion was HUGE. End the meal with their banana split and you won't leave disappointed. Plus you can't beat $2 PBRs and $4 house wine. Our waiter was a little out there, but we didn't let that stop us.
