French/ Vietnamese cuisine!!!?? Even though I had read pretty good yelp reviews on this place, I still was a tad skeptical. However I always have an open mind and I enjoy trying new/unusual places. My fiance took me here for my birthday. I was absolutely impressed with the decor and ambiance... Beautiful and romantic! Candles EVERYWHERE! : ) I felt like I stepped back in time and was in some tropical/exotic place. Our server Angela was very nice, informative and helpful w/ recommending items from the menu. I ordered the lychee sangria, very tasty. For appetizers/entrees we ordered the Pho soup (very very good), Seafood bouillabaisse (ok, but I prob wouldn't order it again. It doesn't live up to all the hype it gets), and the BBQ pork (my favorite out of all the things we ordered). For dessert we ordered the Banana Won Ton and the Macaroon and it was very yummy, just the perfect amount of sweetness. Overall, we had a great time. Food was good and so were the cocktails. Def will be returning! -If you are thinking of going here: You def want to make a reservation. Also I recommend asking to be seated on the 2nd floor terrace (great view of gorgeous Rush St). During the warm months in Chicago the windows on the terrace come down ; ) Also after dinner, spend some time in the lounge. Its dim and cool w/ plenty of seating/couches. Again candles everywhere, perfect way to unwind and end the night.
