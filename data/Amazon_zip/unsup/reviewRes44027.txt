Oh my goodness! We had a great meal, even my 6-year-old niece was impressed with the service. From the salads to the dessert, everything was PERFECT! There was this Gorgonzola dipping sauce for the steaks but worked well with the potato, bread, and chicken. Delicious! As a matter of fact, I tend to be a fashion victim and not a trend setter, however the night we were there I had on a new outfit. The hostess saw me walking back from the washroom and complimented me on my outfit. I know that sounds dorky - but it is nice when someone takes the time to pay a compliment.
