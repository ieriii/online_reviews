Considering this place is a 4 star hotel, I was slightly disappointed with the room decor. The hotel lobby area was so grand and beautiful. I was sure the rooms would be just as nice. Unfortunately, I was slightly let down once I walked into my room. The lighting could've been a lot better, the bathroom door didn't close correctly, and the TV they had was probably the oldest TV I've seen in a hotel room in a while (it wasn't even a flat screen...WTF?). I don't like how these ritzy type hotels charge for internet. I mean, if you're going to charge us that much for a room, at least provide us with some internet so we can get work done, check our emails, Yelp...you know? But other than that, I was comfy in my room. Location was great, next to Millennium Park, short walk from the Cultural Center and Art Institute, and a bunch of restaurants nearby. There was also an entrance to the subway line right in front of one of the hotel entrances. I'm not quite sure if I'd stay here again. Depends on the neighborhood and prices and everything. I wouldn't say that I would never consider this place again, but maybe I'll check out something new if I were given the opportunity.
