I'm in love with this place. Ask me to go back tomorrow and I would take you up on it! 8 delicious courses - one of which BLEW...MY...MIND. I won't go into detail as to not spoil it for those wanting to be surprised by each course, but the dish served in the shell is UNREAL. Each bite was better than the last. I am still drooling over it today. The atmosphere is nice (though the tables are a little too close together). Luckily we were ahead of the people next to us, so we saw everything as new an exciting whereas they saw everything we had before they got it. The service was very good - they are totally open to you bringing as many bottles of wine as you want (and any kind you want). No corkage fee. The best part was that the meal only cost us 100/pp after tax and tip. We had a $10 off coupon which they applied and gave back to us to come and use it again. Can't wait to go again.
