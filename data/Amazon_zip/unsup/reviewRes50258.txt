Disregard my previous review. I was obviously back much faster than I anticipated (I'm not one to turn down free food; I see you, Dad!). The service was top notch this morning. Same time frame from my first visit so maybe it was just an aberration that day? The food, like last time, was again excellent. Our group split the eggs new orleans, corn cakes, popovers and andouille. Everything was consumed quickly, but the andouille was the star here. In house charcuterie is tough to compete with. The beignets at the end of the meal were again a nice touch. I'll be back, sooner than later.
