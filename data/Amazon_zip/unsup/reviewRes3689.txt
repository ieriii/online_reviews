mmmm crisp....what to say? Probably hands-down our faaavvvorite wings of all time. Get the wings with the seoul sassy sauce....big...not wimpy-sized wings with a light crisp coating...tossed and coated with sweet deliciousness. Sprinkled perfectly with green onion slices on top. All I gotta say is...good thing we don't live closer...otherwise, we'd be seriously packing the pounds on this stuff.  SO GOOD!
