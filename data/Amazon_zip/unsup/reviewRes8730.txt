The hostess was very sweet and even though we had a long wait to get our party of 6 seated, she checked in on us several times and told us how much longer we could expect the wait to be. We arrived a little after 9 pm, and at one point she came to check on us and apologized for not asking whether any of us were fasting. She mentioned that she usually makes sure to ask patrons after sundown during Ramadan so that she could bring dates and tea while they waited for table. Now, seriously, that was some VERY sweet, mindful customer service right there. Seriously, that warmed my heart. We ordered kababs all around, including soltani, barg, joojeh, and joojehyeh barg. They were all great, but the joojehyeh barg was a little dry. In my opinion Noon o Kabab is better than Reza's, but not as good as Raffi's in LA. The doogh was expensive at $3 for a slim glass, which couldn't have held more than 8 oz of liquid. The servers weren't very attentive or friendly, but perhaps that was because we arrived at the end of the night on a Saturday, which is why I am not factoring this into the rating.
