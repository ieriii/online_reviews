A really fun place! Went for dinner with a large group of girlfriends. The food was GREAT. Not one complaint. I got the Guajirito sandwich with garlic fries and an avocado salad. Amazing sandwich. Yum. Every person at the table enjoyed what they ordered. The ambiance was nice, too. The hostesses were nice. We sat outside on a warm summer night. A couple next to us was allowed to have their dog with them. The owner walked around to chat with all of us at one point. Not one complaint. Not one!
