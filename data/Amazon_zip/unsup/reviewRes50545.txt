Well, have you ever had a dining experience that involved long drink delivery (seriously you will wait about 20 minutes for a cocktail during brunch), a hair in your scrambled eggs and a drunk former football player completely incoherent who tried to steal your bill? While for entertainment purposes, I would say that this was a slam dunk, for dining experiences, I was disappointed. Our server was lovely, the owner Mark was an absolute doll and appreciated his attention but friends, I had to share with you my unique and wild experience! We had noon reservations and was excited to break my diet here....we started off with a Ginger Mule and a Bacon Bloody Mary (ok so the food came before the drinks, slightly unusual but ok). We started out with the Cheddar & Herb Croquettes - TO DIE FOR!!!!! Next, ordered the Fish and Grits and my friend Wendy ordered the Eggs Benedict - well, um, this short blond hair isn't mine - could you ask the chef to hold the hair in my eggs please (gross, no I don't wish to order anything else). My friends Eggs were well done - um, that's not poached honey, that's an over - well egg (so many issues and only so much space). Oh, the drinks finally came. The bartender to make up for our wait time, provided us with a self made shot to sip on, while this made us happy, it's sad when you have to do this. The drunk man, was sitting at the bar, looked at my friend and started hitting on her. I won't share who he was even though he stated his number, number and informed us that "our fathers would know who he is" What a creepy pick-up line! He bought us a round of drinks and hovered over us (again, go away creepy drunk man), then when our check came, he took it - walked away. Um, creepy drunk man, please come back and no, we don't wish you to pay for us.....the owner retrieved our bill - Mark was a hero!!! I will come back and try it for dinner but finding a hair in the food, long drink waits - it may be awhile.
