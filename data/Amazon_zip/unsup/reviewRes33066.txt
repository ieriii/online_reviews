I love Sultan's. You really cannot get a more flavorful, filling, and cheap meal anywhere else. I've had just about all their sandwiches and a few of their dinner plates - all equally delicious. Yet, my favorite is still the plain ol' chicken. Their falafel, hummus, and eggplant are all delicious as well. I have been dying to try their baklava but never let myself indulge in its yumminess, but it is definitely a must-have. The only other comparable place to Sultan's is Oasis Cafe in the Loop (hard to find and oddly located, but totally worth the hunt!) The cherries on top: Pro: Opened relatively late Con: Only accepts cash and the closest ATMs are in shady liquor stores
