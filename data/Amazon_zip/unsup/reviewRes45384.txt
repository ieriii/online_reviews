I love Wilde. I've been eating, drinking, and generally hanging out at Wilde since they opened but I'm glad I waited until now to write a review. The fact that it's only 2 minutes from my place aside, I was going to scream and rip my hair out if one more Asian/Fishy/Thai/Noodle place opened up on Broadway. I needed something new and Wilde was a good change. Like any new place, Wilde had some growing pains in the beginning and many issues to work through before they got it right. But judging from my experiences there lately I think there's been major improvement. When Wilde first opened the service was slow, the staff/servers were chilly at best, and the food was mediocre. But lately I haven't experienced any of that. Aside from the fact that I think the bar is beautiful and love that the restaurant decorated for Fall, the service seems to have improved and the food has gotten better; Mac & Cheese, YUM! But I'm especially in love with their brunch. Their waffles are fantastic and the Wilde Benedict is one of my absolute favorite benedicts I've ever tried. While the attitude of the servers seems to have improved my only gripe is with the Host/Hostess. They are NEVER friendly when you walk in, and thus, I can't in good conscience give Wilde five stars. Oh, and I generally try to avoid Wilde during any televised sports event because it is then that Wilde seems to have an identity crisis and turns into a wannabe sports bar. Other than that, I love it here, and I'm glad to have it in the hood.
