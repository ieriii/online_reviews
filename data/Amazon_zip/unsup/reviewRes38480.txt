Reservations are a must. BEST stuffed pizza I have ever had in my life. Ordered the stuffed pizza with sausage, spinach and tomatoes. SO GOOD! Shared a small with one other person and we still had 2 slices left over! ordered a salad first just to balance it all out. definitely recommend this to all who are in the area.
