Pequod's has definitely become one of my favorite deep dish places in town. I hear people complain about the thin crust, which I've never tried because the deep dish is so good. The beer selection was ok, but I'm getting tired of Fat Tire, 312, and Anchor being the only Miller/Bud/Coors alternative in town. The place can be packed at times, but usually the wait isn't long - especially with the upstairs area. The staff is always friendly and even lets you order a deep dish pizza if you are waiting. Parking though - is a pain. A big one. I guess that goes for most places in the neighborhood.
