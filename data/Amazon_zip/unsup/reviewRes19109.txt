Better bring a charge code or plan to order a cheeseburger - this place was pricey for good but not great gastropub food. My friend and I stopped by for dinner on a Wednesday night and promptly got a table amid the corporate crowd unwinding at the bar. We split an appetizer, some fried chickpeas concoction the chef was evaluating for the menu. It was nice, but not worth the 5 bites we each got for $10. Being starving grad school students and not wanting to blow our budgets, we each ordered the modestly priced cheeseburger. It was tasty and big enough to be also be my lunch the following day. Would have loved to have tried some of the other options on the menu but being $20+ for an entree felt spendy, although as a local, I forget this is near tourist central.
