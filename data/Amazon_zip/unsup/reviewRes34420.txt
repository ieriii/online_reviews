$10 goes a long way. Urban hip staff. The sandwiches are meals in itself. The dinners are awesome. The salad buffet is fully stocked with the best of the best veggie delights. I must say I never really never get the salads because although everything else is dirt cheap, the salads are priced weight. one time I got a salad there with everything I wanted and it ended up being $17.
