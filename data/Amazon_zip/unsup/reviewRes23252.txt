I've known of Irazu for a while now but never made it over there. I finally did this past Tues (it was fairly busy), and I'm glad I did! The restaurant isn't very large so seating was limited, but it's worth the wait. During warmer months it looks like they can seat more with their outdoor patio. I had the Grilled Steak Dinner and it was awesome! Steak was cooked just right and tasty, you get a small cabbage salad, rice, and sweet fried plantains (my favorite!). They'll ask if you want the yellow rice or one mixed with black beans (forgot the name)...I highly recommend the black bean one, it was full of flavor. Only downside to my dish was that the sauteed scallions were hard to cut further away from the root. Friend had the Veggie Burrito and loved it! It sounds like it is busy there often, so if you're not willing to wait, get take out (saw many people go that route)...but definitely worth trying and going back to!
