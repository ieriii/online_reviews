I expect to have quite a few stellar experiences here as the weather gets rough. More precisely, I hope they will be experiences with an excellent conversation partner, the Big Jones cocktail list, and the incredibly friendly and accommodating staff. No more, no less. Drinks are expertly prepared with quality ingredients, and the service could not have been warmer. Vegan and coastal-comfort cuisine CAN intersect! And the homemade pickles are delicious.
