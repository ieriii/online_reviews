After returning from a trip around Italy I set out to find the most authentic Neapolitan style pizza in Chicago. And by far Spacca Napoli has the most authentic pizza to that served in the Naples area (and south italy). Pizza and ingredients are top quality and fantastic (they use mozzarella di bufala on most of the pizzas which is more $$$).  Some of the reviews complain about not enough cheese, too "wet" (from the sauce and type of cheese), crust falling apart in center; but that is very authentic and exactly like the pizza you will get in Naples. Personally I love this type of pizza!! They even hand out canoli on your way out which is a nice touch. LOVE this place!
