We were seated right away in the outdoor area and really liked the ambiance. I would have to say waiting 20 minutes for a server to take our order made me want to get up and leave. Every table around us was taken and had a very attentive server but wasn't sure why each server saw us, but kept on walking. Finally, Henry the manager took care of us, but it shouldn't have gone to that extent.
