my mother found this place via food network and boy were we glad she did. we of course ordered the peking duck dinner and it was absolutely fantastic! you know the place is going to be great when you can barely understand your waiter because their english isn't any good. this mean a traditional place that has kept their recipe perfected and this duck was cooked beautifully and the skin was absolutely melt in your mouth. there's plenty of seating also, cannot wait to go back!
