Trendy though it may be, this is one of those must-visit places when I happen to be in Chi-town. As a vegan, the many meal options at the Chicago Diner overwhelm my self-control. The prices are a bit up there, although that's to be expected anywhere in Chicago. There's a great casual environment, friendly service and excellent food. Last time I had a Chicken Caesar Sandwich with Flashed Greens, and split an appetizer of Buffalo Wings. Frankly, it is all delicious. If all these reviews aren't enough to talk you into here, check out their menu and see for yourself how exciting this place is.
