There is no shortage of fine dining restaurants in the windy city, but a true Chicago culinary trip will never be complete without a taste of the famous hot dog.  Hot Doug's needs no introduction for those living in Chicago. Even when we arrived at opening time, the wait was at least an hour long during the bitter cold winter. The line can be two hours long during the warmer months. The average of 4 1/2 stars rating with almost two thousands reviews should tell you something. Love the unusual meat selections and flavor combinations. Think pomegranate puree with sheep's milk cheese. Where else can you find snake or alligator sausages in your hot dog? The special menu changes on a regular basis, so don't expect to find that elk sausage the next time. I recommend people to try the foie gras and duck sausage. My only disappointment was the duck fat fries. Not crazy about them without the crunch.
