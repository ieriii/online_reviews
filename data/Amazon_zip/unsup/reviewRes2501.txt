Pros: It's Hot Doug's. I think that says it all. If there is one place I take friends who are visiting Chicago it's here. Doug is a great guy and alwasys has awesome suggestions. The Chicago Dog is easily the best in the city and the specialty dogs are masterworks. On my last trip I had the Black and Blue dog and am not sure I will ever enjoy another hot Dog as much. Cons: The lines and it's CASH only... Still it's 5 stars easy.
