As an expat from New York, I am always on the look out for crispy thin crust pizza with extra sauce and fresh topping but I wasn't so lucky until I found Piece. My girlfriends and I went there for the singles party on Valentines day. We were abit dissappointed by the crowd with overly qualified single women and not enough men but we managed to get a table and order some pizza and beer. From a guy's recommendation, we ordered sausage and mushrooms with green peppers. It was getting late so we were only gonna have a piece or two but then we couldn't stop eating! The crust was extra crewy, the mushrooms were not one of those bland canned ones but had alot of flavor and the sauce was sweet and tangy. Yummmmm~ It was very very close to John's Pizza in NYC but not close enough. It's good enough for Chicago pizza for me though.
