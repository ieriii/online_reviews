My husband and I came here for dinner last night with our friend from out of town. I was hesitant to come here after reading all the 1 and 2 star reviews of this place, but our friend really wanted to try it so we figured we'd give it a shot. We started with the deconstructed ceasar, the hot foie gras small plate with rhubarb and strawberries and we also had a round of foie gras lollipops. Everything was tasty but I especially loved the foie gras lollipops. They were only $5 each too! Some of the reviews said something about the lollipops being $35 so $5 was a definitely bargain. For our entrees, I had the salmon, while my husband had the swordfish and our friend had the veal. Everything was good but not outstanding. The appetizers built our hopes up a bit and the entrees just weren't that amazing. Everything was tasty and edible, just not as great as the starters. Then we had a second round of foie gras lollipops...yum! For dessert we split the lemon poppyseed dessert and the lavendar brulee. The desserts were beautiful and playful. I especially loved the lavendar brulee...the crumble on the plate was a delicious. It was a little bit savory but also sweet. Great combination. The lemon poppyseed was also good and the blueberry gelato was delicious. Overall we had a great experience here. With drinks (3 glasses of wine, 2 cocktails total for our table), the bill was 300 dollars. This really isn't that bad since it's about 100 dollars a person, but we had drinks, appetizers and desserts, and we left full. I am excited to come back and maybe just do a bunch of appetizers and desserts and more of those foie lollipops. The entrees didn't really do it for me though.
