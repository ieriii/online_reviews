First off, they actually delivered our pizza in a TIMELY manner! Yay! It was also good thin crust pizza. It's a miracle! We've ordered pizza from all over the neighborhood and no one could find the apt and the pizza was always disappointing. While it is no Aurelio's (the Best thin crust pizza ever and they don't deliver in the hood), it's a winner. We would suggest ordering extra sauce. It's a rather dry pizza and we prefer saucy!
