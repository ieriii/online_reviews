Wow.I no longer live in Chicago, but XOCO is tempting me to move back.It's that good.I've only been twice, trying the Ahogada Torta and the Pepito Torta with an order of chips and guacamole both times. Both meals were outstanding. Both were seasoned perfectly. Honestly, I can't think of a single critique of either one. If I had to think of a complaint it's that the guacamole is simply average, not outstanding, and the portion of guacamole is meager. The hostess was very gracious, and although it was busy, things flowed along smoothly. Both times I've been, my experience has been great.If you're in Chicago and looking for a good lunch, XOCO is the place.
