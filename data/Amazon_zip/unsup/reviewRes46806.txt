Exquisite! The food spoke for itself. We all enjoyed our meals. The meatloaf and burgers were soooo flavorful. Little salt was used, well because you didnt need it and the sweet potatoe fries were yummy. Next time I need to try them with the goat cheese dip, because there will definitely be a next time.
