Probably my favorite Chinese restaurant in Chicago. I've only had a few of their regular entrees (which were good), but my favorite is to order the hot pot special (where you pay per person). All you can eat hot pot, with decent meat and seafood options, as well as good broth. Definitely perfect as the weather gets a little chilly.
