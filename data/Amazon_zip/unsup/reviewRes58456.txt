I will start by saying that the ambiance was there - interesting artwork, ambient lighting, and what we thought would be good service. However, we were soon disappointed. The meals were lackluster and overpriced. The gnocchi special in tomato cream sauce lacked flavor; this could have been overlooked if the price was $10 and not $25. The lobster ravioli - also $25 was unrecognizable as such under a heavy cream sauce that was not even reduced enough, so still tasted like milk.  Though completely unorthodox in Italy, I doused the sauce with parmesan for flavor. I brought most of it home to go so that I can doctor up the sauce myself. I would have preferred a lighter more flavorful sauce. What do chefs usually do to wow customers with their lobster ravioli? Whatever that is, it is unknown to the chefs at Caro Mio. But the main reason that I was stimulated to write this review - I usually do not bother - is the attitude of the waiter and apparently the manager. He initially came around and asked how everything was - yes, I mistakenly said ok. I then told him what I mentioned above about my dish - the lobster ravioli. Then my companion wrote a review about our meals. She and I both signed this and I handed it to the waiter who became defensive, stating that I should have said something when asked and the chef could have done something. The waiter was not at all apologetic about our complaints. We would only return should we be offered a gift certificate for a future meal and then only return again if we were wowed by that meal.
