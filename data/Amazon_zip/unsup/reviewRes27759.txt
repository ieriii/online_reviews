I've visited Chicago from NC 4 times now since I have 3 good friends in the city. They've taken me to numerous popular Chicago pizzerias and Pequod's is by far my favorite of all. I'm a sauce lover, and I find that many of the other pizzas are lacking in that department, but Pequod's knows how to deliver it! It's just a great pizza!
