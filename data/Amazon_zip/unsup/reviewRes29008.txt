The thing is, the ceviche really is that good. If you order nothing but the ceviche trio, it will have been worth the wait. The guacamole is excellent, although the portion is pretty small (if you're used to CA generosity with all things avocado, be prepared for something less generous), and the chips are fresh and yummy. The summer margarita reminds you what margaritas can be like, and the hint of cucumber is as refreshing as it sounds. The main dishes we had were good, but not exceptional. The swordfish and shrimp was good, but not the shazzam we expected after the ceviche goodness we started with. The mole was underwhelming, but good enough. Honestly, the Ceviche Trio is enough to make me want to return. But I'll probably stick to the small plates and skip the main courses altogether. The wait was long, but what else can you expect at a place as well known. But it wasn't the 2-3 hours promised, and the staff was friendly and professional.
