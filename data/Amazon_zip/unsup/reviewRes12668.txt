I tried Cafe 28 on the recommendation of a friend. Definitely a little bit out of the way, but one of the better brunches I've had in the Windy City, especially for the price. The breakfast burrito and the goat cheese omelet were both outstanding, and Cafe 28 definitely has a cozy, low-key vibe, making it a great place to be when it's 5 degrees outside.
