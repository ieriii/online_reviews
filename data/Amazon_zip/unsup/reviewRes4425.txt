Finally, I made it to the Green Mill last night. After weeks and weeks of not being able to go out at all whatsoever on punishment of death, I made it to one of the most lovely places I have been in Chicago, so far. A 100 year old jazz club that used to be Mr. Al Capone's premier hangout? Sold. Beautiful place. We went to see Von Freeman last night, and when a "name" is playing (shows start at 8 and run till midnight) I advise getting there early. We arrived between 7 and 730, and our crew (which started at five and ballooned to nine) were seated at Mr. Capone's personal booth (plus some chairs, of course), and attended to by our waitress immediately. Drinks are at great prices, the music is fantastic, and the crowd, while packed, is quite solid and could not possibly annoy me. Or at least, it didn't last night. I bet you've already been here, right? Oh, you haven't? THEN GO.
