Awesome atmosphere - the pictures don't do it justice. Service was almost overwhelming - we probably had a total of four servers making sure we had enough to drink, to eat. As far as the food? Meh. Granted I went on a night where I wasn't starving...heck, I wasn't even really starving. We split the chili because it was a cold, windy and rainy night here and it was okay. A little too "smokey" for my tastebuds and too much sour cream (which is something I'd never thought I'd ever say). I might give it another go on a night where I'm more than hungry. But for the first time around, give me Montgomery Inn ribs any day of the week.
