For those times you really have a hankering for southern food, Wishbone does a pretty good job with fulfilling those desires. I've been there a few times and have yet to have something I didn't like. It is definately colorful on inside and you if love rooster decor, there are plenty of rooster pictures and rooster structures all over the place. The food... The jambalaya is good. It's not quite like the jambalaya I've had in the dumpy parts of N'Orleans where everything is much better, but it's good. If it's brunch or breakfast, the jambalaya omelet is awesome.  Gumbo is worthy of getting. The salmon cakes and crab cakes are good. I could actually just eat them and forget the rest the menu. On Mon-Fri bike riders get 15% off entrees when showing their bike helmets.
