After spending a good few days looking for a restaurant to celebrate our 3 year anniversary and seeing Mia Francesca had great reviews, I went ahead and made a reservation on opentable. Our anniversary fell on a Saturday this year so when we got there....guess what? It was beyond packed, I think I saw a few people sitting on other people's laps! Of course I had no idea they had this secret back patio with plenty of space and I have to admit it was much more romantic than the front of the restaurant, so it was perfect! They have an open space and a closed space with open doors in the back. We sat in the closed part but because the doors were wide open we really had the best of both worlds. Our server was very attentive and nice enough to bring us a few different red wines for us to taste and choose. Their bruschetta was out-of-this world, and our entrees were very delicious. I had the penne primavera and he had some chicken dish with pasta. They don't have a huge menu which is nice because then it's easier to pick. I have no doubt everything is delicious here. I couldn't have been happier! Mia Francesca is definitely one of my favorite places for Italian at this point.
