I hadn't even heard of this place before I went here with my wife and a few friends on Saturday night. What a pleasant surprise. We ordered about half the items on the menu and split them up. Nothing we ordered disappointed us. The things that stuck out as particularly excellent were: the pork belly entree, the cornbread, and the pastas, which were phenomenal. The other stuff we got (pot roast, brussel sprouts, cheese dish, and cauliflower come to mind) were uniformaly excellent. We also got brownies ala mode for desert. They have an extensive drink menu (hence the "bar" in the title). Total bill for the four of us (we were relatively light drinkers) was 200 + tip. The atmosphere was cool, too. All in all, this was a great dining experience. I don't think you can do much better at the $50/person price point.
