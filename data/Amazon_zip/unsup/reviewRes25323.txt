Amazing food. The pizza is easily the best deep dish pizza I've ever had. The fried cheese and marinara sauce was top notch as well. The waitresses could give patrons more attention though. Ours checked on us only once, but she was quick about filling our requests. The decor is about what you'd expect for a local sports bar turned restaurant. I recommend seating upstairs as it's more family friendly and less "bar".
