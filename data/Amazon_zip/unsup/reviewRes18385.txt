There are many reasons I can't help but instantly love The Bad Apple, but the first is their poutine. Poutine? What is this strange sounding dish that my American spell checker won't recognize? Well friends, its Canada's contribution to the culinary arts: french fries, gravy, and cheese curd. And OH CANADA does the Bad Apple do it right. If the poutine wasn't enough Canadian content for you, try some of the excellent beers from Unibroue. Even without the Unibroue offerings, Bad Apple boasts one of the strongest beer lists outside of Hopleaf. Beer snobs will feel right at home. They even serve PBR in case you like your beer unrefined and unassuming. A last note on food. You'll find all the familiar pub favorites, but executed in new and artful ways. The burgers and sandwiches are distinct, and an absolute pleasure to eat. Finally, you can enjoy all this from their game room, which has a pinball machine, shuffle board (coming soon!), and a wide variety of board games.
