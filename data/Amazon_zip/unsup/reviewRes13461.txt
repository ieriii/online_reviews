I give this place 5 stars based solely on the music they were playing upstairs. Literally every few minutes, I would whip out my phone and try to Shazam the songs (with not much luck unfortunately - too much background noise)! It was definitely the type of music I would expect to hear at a casual hipster brewery like this. The restaurant had a warm ambiance with the lighting, fireplaces and exposed brick, which was exactly what I was looking for on a cold October night! The beer selection was good and the food exceeded my expectations. We tried the bacon fat popcorn, cauliflower soup, applewood smoked wings, autumn harvest pizza and fish & chips. The bacon fat popcorn was not as amazing as everyone describes but it was good. The wings were deliciously spicy and I couldn't stop eating them. The pizza wasn't that memorable but the fish and chips were great. This is a great choice to go with a few friends or a date to have a casual meal and drinks. I will definitely be back!
