I wanted to try Coast so badly based on all the good reviews and recommendations from people. I made reservations for a Friday night. I was pretty disappointed with the table we were given, which was right in the middle of traffic, but they had nothing else available. The restaurant was very crowded and so loud that we could hardly talk to each other without shouting. We could, however, easily hear the lady one table over with a loud, aggravating voice. It is a really big place for a sushi restaurant, and it doesn't look like much has been done to reduce noise issues and keep an intimate atmosphere. So my much-awaited Coast excursion had a very rocky start. The sushi, however, was extremely good. If it weren't for the amazing sushi, I probably wouldn't bother going back. But I will probably try this place again - perhaps on a non-weekend night or with a different group who has better hearing :-)
