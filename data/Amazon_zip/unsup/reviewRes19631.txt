For a variety of stupid reasons on my part I had already eaten lunch when I arrived but I promised I'd go and it was my last day in Chicago. Therefore, I only got the churros and the Aztec chocolate. I lusted after the majority of the menu. Oh my god the soups sound divine. After chastising myself for bad decision making I tucked into those churros which tasted great (I'd never had any before). The aztec chocolate was a very new experience. It isn't sweet like a classic hot chocolate but I enjoyed it a great deal the flavor was very deep. The place seemed great and I plan to eat soup dinner there should I find myself in Chicago again.
