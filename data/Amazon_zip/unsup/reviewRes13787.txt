We were on our way to get some Mediterranean food when this little place caught our eye. We quickly jerked into the parking lot to give it a try and we are so glad we did. This little Cuban shack serves up large portions of fabulousness. The flash fried pork and plantains were crazy great. Even better was a large basket of fried yucca - oh yeah!!!! Don't expect table serve, let alone a table. This tiny joint is decorated cutely and has the nicest counter girl you could ever ask for.
