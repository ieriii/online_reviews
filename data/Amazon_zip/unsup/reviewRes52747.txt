We had a reservation last night @ 7:30, and unfortunately were running late - and to make you aware - policy is that they hold your table up to 20m then it's released (which is fair). We made it there with 5m to spare and kicked off the meal with some fried maduros, empanadas, choripan, and a pitcher of mojitos (brought the Rum). All the apps were good, choripan was our favorite. For dinner I went with the puerco rostizado, which had come recommended; however, overall i wasn't too impressed - the pig roast was dry and i almost thought the flavor was too sweet (personal preference, i know). The service was okay, but all in all i just felt the spot didn't live up to its 'hype' which isn't an easy thing to do. Also to clarify there is a BYOB corkage fee, it's $3 per 6-pack or 'large' bottle.
