Just had a great breakfast here. We got in early so there were only a couple other customers in the place. Service was nice and quick. Food was really good. They had their own little twist on scrambled eggs; chives and parmesan cheese. It came with some great honey maple ham and hash browns with onions and, I think, sour cream. It was fantastic. The place has a great, quaint look too.
