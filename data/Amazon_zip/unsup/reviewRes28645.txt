Frontera Grill will go down in my dining blogs for two memorable reasons. My first celebrity sighting in Chicago, after all the years in the city - and none other than the big O...rather the OTHER big O- Winfrey herself! Of course, she was serenaded to some exclusive secretive quarters at Frontera while we were left languishing at the adjacent Topolabampo bar for over an hour on a Fri night with some good spirits for company! The other reason - the Brazo de Indio - one of the only two vegetarian options on the menu. I was expecting a good old fashioned heavy Tamale but this Mexican masterpiece looked so good, had freshness written all over it and the topping of cucumber and jicama with a liberal dose of some spectacular sauces made me a believer - Mexican food can be flavorful and healthy! I wasn't particularly impressed with the desserts. I cringed when I saw the damage to my credit card. But despite the disappointment of not utilizing the Restaraunt week deals at this restaraunt, I think I am definitely a fan.
