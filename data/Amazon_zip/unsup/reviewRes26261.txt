I am not a pizza lover. Ironically enough, as someone who grew up in Chicago all of her life, I'm not an avid deep dish pizza lover. I don't despise pizza, it's just hardly ever something I crave. However, Pequod's was amazing! I loved how crispy the crust was! My out-of-state friends are wanting to try deep dish and I had no idea where to take them until I had Pequod's! Plus, it doesn't hurt that they're a Blackhawks bar!
