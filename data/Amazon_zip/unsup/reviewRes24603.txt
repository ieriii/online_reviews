We had a Groupon deal for this place ($30 for $60 of food) . I absolutely enjoyed myself at Geja's and would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a great date spot. The ambiance is intimate & mellow. There was a Spanish guitar player only three tables away (with mic/sound system) and my wife & I could have a hushed conversation without a problem. Ok, physical side of the review is over. Now on to the food & drink. Their wine list is pretty extensive and very reasonably priced. I had a few wonderfully paired glasses of a Pinot Gris that went well with my seafood. We ended up ordering The Connoisseur, which has some beef, lobster & shrimp. But before that came, we got the plate of bread & fruit with the cheese dipping sauce & a salad (included in the price). Then came the meat plate (with veggies). Absolutely wonderful. I thought the lobster was a little lacking in taste, but that was fine as we had 8 dipping sauces to choose from (red thai chili, barbecue, dill, butter, etc). The beef was so tender, I cut it with my fork. Finally, the dessert plate came & it was almost too late. I was definitely full, but with that kind of deliciousness yet to come, I had to give it a try. First, they light the chocolate on fire and give you four marshmallows to toast. Then you have a plate full of pineapple, apple, cherries, & strawberries to dip in your chocolate sauce. You see where I'm going with this. IT WAS FANTASTIC!! I really want to give this place 5 stars, I really do. Here's why I'm not: 1. It's pretty cramped. I'm 6' 2" & 230lbs so there's not a lot of elbow room for bigger fellas like me. 2. Once the place is to capacity, the service went down a notch (from our server, not the water guys and dish guys). Sounds petty, but there it is. Bottom line: I fully recommend this place and will definitely be going back. Everything was wonderful and so close to our place in Old Town. Check it out, you won't be disappointed!!!
