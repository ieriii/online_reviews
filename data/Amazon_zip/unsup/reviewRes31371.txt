The first stop on my recent Birthdaypalooza Tour was a Saturday night dinner date at Mastro's with my husband. The crowd featured a mix of 20-something wannabes (shout out to the 7' tall guy with the 5' bleached blond girl in the tangerine-colored summer dress who bypassed the "no reservations, no chance of a table tonight" hostess for the maitre d' who, for whatever reason, offered him a private dining room--and no, he is not a Chicago Bull) and mid-50-something suburbanites looking for a hot night on the town (super shout out to the three couples who arrived together via limousine and immediately pointed up to the sky at the many large buildings). The food and drinks were good but not entirely amazing. As follows: -Shrimp Cocktail: B+ (3 large and delicious shrimp set in dry ice but for $17/order, I would like 5 shrimp, please) -Stuffed Mushrooms: B (on the heavy side but tasty and, unlike the shrimp cocktail, there were way too many of them for two people) -Bone-In Filet: B- (this is their signature steak and it was just average) -Kansas Strip Steak: A (delicious from start to finish on the day of and as leftovers the day after) -Lobster Mashed Potatoes: C (a total disappointment) -Butter Cake: A (would be A+ if they added a little chocolate sauce) -Wine: B+ (expensive but generous pour) -Coffee: C (should be upgraded) The "team service" should have been flawless (or else why have team service?) but it was not. Our server (who looked like she was 12 years old) was very sweet and attentive at first but she and "her team" dropped the ball multiple times (no water refills, no coffee order taken with dessert, etc.) I'm glad we tried it but I doubt we'll return very often if ever. The whole experience felt like an evening in Las Vegas with good food at a high price and an equally cheesy yet not quite as "high-class cheese" crowd. And, although we love Vegas, we can only take it (and now Mastro's) in small doses.
