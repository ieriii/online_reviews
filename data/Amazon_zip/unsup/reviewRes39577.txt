The staff here have SO much to learn about customer service. The staff makes you feel as though you are nothing but a burden. They are rude and very unattentive. When you are served food in a restaurant, the server is not supposed to throw the food on the table with such force that it falls off the plate. I have had 2 bad dealings with this restaurant. A friend was flying into Chicago late at night and I wanted to know what time they closed. I called the restaurant only to hear a click, but no one said anything. I said, "Hello?" I was snapped at, "WHAT YOU WANT?" I asked politely what time they closed. The lady yelled at me, "OPEN 24 HOURS!" Then hung up on me. I took a large party of people there for a friend's birthday and it was a disaster. We ordered a large bowl of soup and they did not bring any small bowls for us to use. We had to ask for bowls 3 times. We ordered 2 bottles of soju, had to ask for it twice, and did not receive glasses with it when they finally did bring the bottles. We had to ask for glasses three times. After the 3rd time asking, the waitress snapped at us, "In a minute! Can't you see that I am busy!" we had to get up and go get the glasses ourselves. The bill was close to $350 for our group in which case we were not going to leave a tip due to the deplorable service. As we were putting our coats on, our waitress comes back to our table...now she is so nice and sweet...to tell us that we are supposed to leave her a tip. I left by flipping a quarter at her. A tip is EARNED not required. If you want a Korean BBQ house, there are several others that are just as good and actually know how to treat their customers.
