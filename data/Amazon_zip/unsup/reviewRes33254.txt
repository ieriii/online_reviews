My sister took us here for brunch. She boasts that it's her favorite brunch place so far in the city, and she wasn't wrong. The wait at 9am on a Saturday morning was 20 minutes. It was definitely worth the wait. We were seated in a booth and within minutes you can tell how efficient their service is to get as many people seated as possible. However, they don't sacrifice attentiveness to customers with their efficiency. My sister had an omelette which was massive! She had leftovers that would have been a meal in itself. My husband had the Eggs Benedict, which he also couldn't finish. I had the French Toast Combo and was the lone finisher of my brunch. It was very delicious. The French Toast was fluffy, tasty, and warm. We're definitely fans!
