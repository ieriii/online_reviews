Came here after getting in by bus from Wisconsin. Was beyond hungry and it was still breakfast time (fave meal of the day). In comes Nuevo Leon. We were sat down quickly and ordered some food. We got there before a huge group of people walked in and were waiting in line. Phew, just in time. I ordered the Flautitas de queso panela which were delicious! I love me some good cheese. I also ordered some horchata, refreshing. Then we ordered some huevos con chorizo..yummmm. The tamales were small but filling. Definitely need to come here and try the chimichangas. Great food and cheap. also, CASH ONLY. If I remember correctly there is an ATM inside.
