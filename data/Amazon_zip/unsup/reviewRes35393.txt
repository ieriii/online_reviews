Saw Sun Wah on The Food Network, Meat & Potatoes and had to try the Duck! Let me say it did not disappoint! Very Yummy! Made reservations for 7pm on Saturday and I am sure glad I did, the place was packed and we got seated right away. Was able to find street parking. For $38 (the price went up they had signs saying they were raising prices a little bit) You get a Whole Duck, Buns, Duck fried rice and Duck Soup. They cut the duck right at the table for you. The duck was awesome! Nice and moist and the skin crispy. The fried rice was good but I didn't really taste the duck in it and I didn't try the soup. The girl that cut the duck was very friendly and kinda explained everything to us. Our server was a little iffy, he came got our order, gave us our beer (someone else brought the food out) and when we were done gave us the check. We only saw him 3 times, I wanted to order one more thing but the guy never came around, so there was no point for me to order another item. Luckily there was a guy walking around filling up the water.
