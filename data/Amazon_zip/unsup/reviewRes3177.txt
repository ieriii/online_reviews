Oh crisp... Once one of my favorite spots now I'm not so sure... I always enjoyed Steak bowl until last weekend I went back. Why is it sooooo sweet? Is it becoming panda express now? As an born and raised in Asia Asian, I am pretty anti-Americanized Asian food. Now your move Crisp, be another street mall-ish Chinese restaurant or be back to yourself. I still have faith in you!
