I am a thin crust kind of girl, but I must admit this is the best deep dish pizza I have ever had. Not just in Chicago but anywhere.  My parents are the same way and when i took them there while they were in town, my mom was not even going to try it. However, when I told her about the yummy burnt cheese on the crust she was all over it. it takes a little while to get your food, but it is worth the wait. The pizza comes out hot and fresh. Overall a great place and I would highly recommend it to anyone.
