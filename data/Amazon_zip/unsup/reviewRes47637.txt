Brunch Roll Please. PEOPLE, THIS IS WHERE IT'S AT!! It's a $24 all-you-can-eat meat, veggie and dessert bonanza!! I hit up the brunch yesterday with a delightful crew of yelpers and feasted on: maple cajun bacon (holy mother of gawd almighty); egg frittata; crab cake benedict; cured meats; french toast w/ a fresh berry medly; smoked chipotle cheeses; hot, gooey, CINNAMON ROLLS (swoon!); some coffee? why yes please!; back to the savory w/ some portuguese sausage, a lil salmon, some rump roast (hellz yeah!); lil fruit to cleanse the palate; some corned beef hash; another coffee? don't mind if I do!; "I should really hit up that salad bar"'; how did I miss the hash browns?; salami-time! YES! ALL IN THAT ORDER! Was that the end? Bitch, please. THAT WAS ALL BEFORE DESSERT. You CANNOT, MUST NOT, leave before trying the delicious bread budding w/ butterscotch. Umm, and the Clementini. Check, please.
