Pros: Amazing service, great amenities, clean and high-end, perfect/accessible location. One of the better boutique hotels I've seen. Cons: Nothing off the top of my head. Can be pricey. The service here is fantastic, and that's what I live for. I really didn't take advantage of it as much as I could have, but down in the lobby, I met some girls from Texas who had the concierge get them Oprah show tickets and waive their $40 cover charges at clubs. Ha. The doormen were GREAT. So nice, always offered to give directions, on the ready to help us with anything and call us cabs. Really really sweet guys, and they really made an effort to remember who we were. They have turndown service and leave a sweet baked treat on your pillow every night... and housekeeping comes twice everyday. Excessive for some, but I like things clean. The rooms are spacious--ours had a little nook for office work. The bar was great--very well stocked, with the usual amenities and iPod dock, but also with actually good late night snacks (real munchie food) and martini glasses ready for use. They always left a fresh bucket of ice for us everyday as well, which was very nice. I think we got room service at some point, but I can't remember, so can't really comment on that.  There's also a really well-stocked gym downstairs. It's a lot nicer and has more equipment than most hotel gyms. Fresh towels, lemon water, etc.  Conveniently located in the center of Downtown. It's right across the street from Trader Joe's, which was awesome. We picked up champagne and wine there everyday. Also not far from Second City, and 5 minutes from Blue Chicago (awesome blues club). I would stay here again and again.
