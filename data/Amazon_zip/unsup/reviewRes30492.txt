I feel that I should have been impressed by this restaurant, but I just wasn't. It's definitely a cool atmosphere and a cool crowd, but I'll agree with Lorelle L. with the fact that everything was just so BLAND. I ordered the Apple Walnut Salad. It was good, but not made up of much; the majority of it was just spinach and broccoli. There were apples, of course, and also dried cranberries. They were quite good but it was served with a mustard dressing. Ick! It was not a complimentary flavor. One of my friends ordered a vegan pancake breakfast and said his was a bit bland as well. One giant plus--the apple juice. It's amazing! Not worth $5.50 for the small glass it's in, but damn, it's good!!  I may give it a try again next time I'm in Chicago and try something other than a salad. But for now, I'm less than impressed.
