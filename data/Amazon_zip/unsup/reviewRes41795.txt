The hostess was very rude. Made us wait for an half hour so we'd be closer to our reservation time. Then seated us at a table that had been empty the whole time. When we asked to be moved to an adjacent table the hostess rudely grabbed our menus from us & dropped them on the table we requested. As she turned away she snipped, enjoy! The music was loud so conversation was challenging. The inside is very dark and I swear the kept turning the lights lower as the night went on. Food & drinks were quite good though. I would not recommend this place to anyone thanks to the snotty hostess.
