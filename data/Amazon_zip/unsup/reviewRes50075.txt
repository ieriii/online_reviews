From reading the local gossip pages, it seems this place is quite the athlete's hangout. But I'm here to point out that it has some terrific brunch items and is a nice way to pass a weekend afternoon. I even posted a picture of the $3 side of cheesy fries. Yes, all that for $3. And they have sweet potato fries and the onion rings are still awesome. This place is a PMS dream. Take that, hockey players.
