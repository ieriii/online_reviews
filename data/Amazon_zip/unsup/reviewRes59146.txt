I absolutely love their rice bowels. My sister and I order them about once a week. My favorite is the vegetable bowel. It looks like too mush food, but before I know it, I've got it all mixed up, added their dressing and it is gone. My sister enjoys the silver haze bowel. We've had their $10 sushi lunch specials too. Excellent food and staff!
