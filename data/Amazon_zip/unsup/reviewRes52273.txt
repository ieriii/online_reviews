I went to Gino's in June of '08 before a Cubs game. BUSY! My boyfriend knows the area so he knew to go SUPER early before the game, we went around 4:30 p.m. The wait wasn't too horrible, maybe about 30 min. But make sure you know that the pizza takes a while. Ours took almost 40 minutes to come out. It was my first time having deep dish pizza in Chicago (instead of rip-off Uno's on the east coast). It was DELICIOUS! Took me a second to understand the whole sauce ontop business, but it was so good. Not for the light stomachs, and make sure you like cheese. I've had pizza in Chicago a few times now, but Gino's East still remains my favorite.
