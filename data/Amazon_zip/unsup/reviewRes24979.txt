Had the most amazing time here last night. Loved the vibe of the room and the late-night dining crowd.  Service was excellent. Our server Fred (?) explained the menu really well and let us know when we ordered either too much, or not enough. We opted for doing the wine flight, which I strongly suggest, so you can take a mini tour of Spanish wines without having to commit to a bottle. Loved learning about a few new grapes, and found some new favorites! Now onto the food: starter: Bread rubbed with tomato, garlic and herbs Octopus and potato Then we had these little balls of cheese, chorizo, deep fried over a roasted pepper sauce-I forget what they were called, but all I know is they rocked. Fig salad, bleu cheese, wrapped in prosciutto--this was fantastic Prawns a la Planxa (suck-the-juice-from-the -head-delicious)--I went somewhere far away while eating those. YUM. Special of the evening: homemade lamb sausage and feta black lentils, chickpeas, and feta Dessert was a cross between chocolate pot du creme, creme brulee, and vanilla ice cream, with espresso granita on top. A mixture of all of my favorite things in one bowl--too bad I had to share :) We'd definitely return, bring some friends, and try the suckling pig. It was a great night, expect to pay approx $100/pp "all-in" We also heard about their brunch--$25, 5 tapas, and unlimited bloodymary bar? Sounds like an awesome value and a great time!
