If I could give them a 0 star I would. I ate here about a year ago and had a very mediocre experience. The meat all seemed super bland, over cooked and dry. A friend bought me the Groupon to give them another try. I didn't get to use it in time,but said it would always be good at face value. The manager at Texas de Brazil had other thoughts and said I would not be able to use it. Well they blew their second chance. Zed451 is the best and Fogo de Chao is next. I do not recommend this over priced steakhouse. They are mediocre at very best.
