Let me preface by saying I had a short stint in NJ. The prices for the quality and quantity of food out there are jawdropping. The food here is pretty darn good tood, the only thing that is lacking is service. Yes, i know this is pretty much it when it comes down to Cuban food. That doesn't mean you have keep your nose so darn high. First time I stopped in I shook it off as the person behind the counter is having a bad day. Second time around got the same snippity attitude. If it wasn't because food is pretty good and I enjoy having different latin flavors besides mexican food I probably wouldn't be so kind.
