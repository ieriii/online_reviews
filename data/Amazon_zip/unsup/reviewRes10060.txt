BEST. OUTDOOR. PATIO. Really looks like a "little dream" (english translation of piccolo sogno). Food was pretty good, friend got the black spaghetti with seafood and I got the four cheese ravioli. Four cheese ravioli was okay...I liked her spaghetti more. We got dessert (chocolate cake and hazelnut gelato) and they wrote "happy birthday" and did the whole singing candle thing for my friend! I thought that was nice, especially because I never directly told the server, but I just listed "birthday" on OpenTable! The hazelnut gelato was amazing.
