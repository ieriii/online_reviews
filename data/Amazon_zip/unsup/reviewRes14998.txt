If you didn't know this place was here, you would walk right on by. Find the mural painted wall, locate the door handle and walk back in time a bit. This place makes you feel as if you are going to the underground but with a modern flare. Its white accents with dark seats, flowing curtains and white candles give it a very cool vibe. 3 different rooms with a little different feeling we thought. The drinks are all the same price and a bit pricey. You pay for the ambiance. The Dark and stormy was my favorite. This is a place you have to try at least once with a few friends. There was one group that was rather noisy but that's going to happen.
