Whatever on the wait. I think I get this place. You wait an hour for food, by the time you're served it's been a little over an hour, anything you get tossed seems like baby Jesus made it. Arrrgh I'm starved this is great! Or not?I dunno.Duck fat fries. Soggy. I like crispy. You gotta be slightly on the dorky side to stand around for sausages. Seriously, get over it. Yeah it's good, but is this it? Good not great. Whatever dorks enjoy.
