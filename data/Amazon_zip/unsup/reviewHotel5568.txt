I was originally very suspicious of this hotel. It was extremely inexpensive and I couldn't find any reviews online. The Hotel Lincoln turned out to be a great place. The interior looks like a set from a John Waters movie. The hotel is very convenient to Wrigley Field and the Lincoln Park Zoo. I will return to this hotel.
