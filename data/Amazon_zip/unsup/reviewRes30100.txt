Sunda is by far one of my favorite restaurants in this amazing city of food! I get excited to take new people there just so they can experience the goodness of the food, atmosphere and service.  Most people think that they only serve sushi and that is not true. First off, the sushi IS unbelievable. The sashimi will be some of the best you've ever tasted and the chefs know what they are doing. The brussel sprouts salad is one of the best things on the menu. They have asian fusion food above and beyond sushi that you won't want to miss. Go with a big group so you can share everything! Lastly, the service is fantastic. You'd think they could be stuck up but it's the total opposite. I had chosen Sunda as my place of choice for my birthday and they treated me like royalty. The sushi chef brought us complimentary sake...a few times and Billy Dec came over to wish me a happy birthday. It was one of the best dinner experiences I'd ever had.  Don't miss out on this gem!
