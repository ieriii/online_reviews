The atmosphere at Indie Cafe is really very pleasant. It is usually never too crowded and even when it is technically at full capacity, it never feels uncomfortable. The decor is modern and sleek from its walls down to its tableware. Now, let's get this straight. The sushi is pretty good and on the creative side. The thai dishes are, in my opinion, somewhat better and usually what I go with. The Indie Signature Curry? If this dish were a song, it would totally be my jam! However, ladies and gentlemen, I must now clarify. I am giving this restaurant 5 stars instead of the 4 that it deserves SOLELY because of their one and only, their crab rangoon. It has been years since I had the pleasure of eating this for the first time and it still remains as one of the top ten things I have EVER eaten. So what is so spectacular about this Crack Rangoon? Oh, pardon me, Crab Rangoon? What isn't spectacular is more the question. Yes, there is crab. Yes, there is cream cheese. Yes, there are wonton wrappers, but there is so much more! There are, what I believe to be, grated carrots and celery added to the seasoned mixture that add a great texture and taste. Paired with one of the better sweet & sour sauces I've tried? Truly heavenly.
