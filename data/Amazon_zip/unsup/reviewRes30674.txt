The food was fantastic! You HAVE to try the buttercake if you go! We also enjoyed the steaks and seafood. Mastro's understands fine dining and can compete in the Chicago steak house ring.  However, it was VERY pricey, more so than their competitors, and my wife and I felt rushed out. I was disappointed that after ordering a nice bottle of wine and appetizers through desserts that we felt like they pushed you out for the next seating. So, in short, great food, pricey, and good service (our waiter knew the food well and gave great recommendations). If you have a lot of money to drop on a special occasion in the city I would put this in the running. However, there are some AMAZING Chicago steak houses that would fall first on my list over this one.
