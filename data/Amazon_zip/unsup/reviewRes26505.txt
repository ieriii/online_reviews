I just loved the dining experience here. The tapas plates were out of this world. I wish I could write more about the food. It's hard to remember it all. Octopus, serrano ham, bacon wrapped dates, a cheese assortment, chocolate croquettes, and some other stuff. Amazing presentations for all the dishes. They had a wine list with a lot of reasonably priced selections. I decided to venture into the great unknown and have a mencia/garnacha blend. The garnacha was only 40% of the blend, but just like in senatorial politics, 40% can be enough to be a majority sometimes. The only thing I'd like to see changed is the noise level. Having a conversation that cuts through the din can be challenging. We were able to have a wonderful anniversary dinner in spite of that, though. There are so many dishes I want to try that I wasn't able to try this time. A return trip will be necessary at some point.
