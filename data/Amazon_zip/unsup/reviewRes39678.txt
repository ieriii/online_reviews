I came back again, with a date. This time I tried .... for my very first time, ESCARGOT.  I actually like the texture. I did not, however like the taste. So I hear the traditional way to prepare escargot is with a LOT of butter and a LOT of garlic. Apparently this is to disguise the utter taste of dirt and sand flavor of snail. haha I will definitely try escargot again, just not here. And not in a bordelaise -- I don't think that was the best sauce. We ordered the ricotta gnuddi with porcini marmalade and crispy sage. Mmmmmm. It reminded of a warm holiday with a twinge of sweetness there.  My date and I tried the candied apple with butternut squash semifreddo, fresh chestnuts and salty caramel. He thought this sounded great and it's normally not something I would choose, but DAYAMN GINA. This was fucking amazing!! Pardon my language. It was definitely swoon worthy and the Alterra coffee was strong and delicious with it.  You know, of course I'll be back here. It's a new favorite spot of mine. Really.
