My son took me there at my request after seeing it on Check Please. The food was very good, well presented; our waitstaff was knowledgeable and engaging. LOVED our dessert!!! I really liked its insistence on local and organic food sourcing but the bright and cheerful ambiance will bring me back too. A go-to destination even though it's not in our 'hood!
