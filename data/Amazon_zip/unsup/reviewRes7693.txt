Come here with an empty stomach. You don't want to not eat as much as you can because that'll just be a waste of money. I've been to a Brazilian steakhouse before in San Mateo, Espetus Churrascaria. The only difference is Fogo de Chao does not have shrimp. Their filet mignon was soo good. The fried plantains were also very good. I could eat those for days. But what really stood out was their service. They were very attentive and not in a pretentious way;it came off as nice and friendly. Had a great experience dining here, I give them 5 stars.
