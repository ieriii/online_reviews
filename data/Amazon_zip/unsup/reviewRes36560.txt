I must say after reading the other reviews, Meli was a total let down! We waited for 30 minutes only to have the worst service ever and to then be rushed thru our breakfast! While placing the food on the small table, my friend assisted the server by moving things out of the way. In doing so, she knocked un-unsed tea bag on the floor. She requested another one and was told it would be $1.85!! Really?? For a tea bag that was never used that the server could see on the floor? Has it come to that? We were unable to enjoy our meals and conversation because every few minutes an employee would interupt us to ask us if we were done with our plate. Now, never mind that the plate still had a substantial amount of food remaining on it. WOW,the pressure to turn a table! After the third request, I just gave in and made the decision that Meli Cafe is not the breakfast spot for me. I am back to the regualr spots. Bongo Room or Sweet Maple Cafe. Places that value your business and treat you as such!
