I am not a huge beer drinker, but I pretend to be when I come here. They have a whole book to choose from and even a beer hater can find a beer he or she might like! Whats even better is their food here. I had their mussels and it was delicious. You can get it cooked in beer or curry. I choose the curry, which was delicious. Though I might not come back for their mussels anytime soon (because I just found a great recipe for mussels at home), I will come back for more food and more beer. When you walk in, you might be fooled that its only a bar, but move towards the back where the dining area is. I hear the wait can be a b*tch most of the time, but luckily I went when nobody decided to go because I got seated in 5 min.
