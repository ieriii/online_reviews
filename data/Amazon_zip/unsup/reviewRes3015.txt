We had not been to Tru for several years, but had fond memories there of several wonderful meals. It did not disappoint tonight! Both the food and the service were spectacular. We are lucky enough to have dined at most top restaurants in Chicago and many others across the country. Tru remains a favorite and deserves to rank among the very best restaurants in Chicago.
