Oh yeah baby, got the sausage topped with foie gras w/ truffle aioli. Yum. Loved the foie gras so much I just couldn't focus much on the sausage. Hubby had the garlic sausage topped with roasted, moist, soft garlic and havarti cheese chunks. That was REALLY delicious too. Of course, duck fat fries which are so yummy without condiments.  Since the wait's so long (2.5 @#$#@ hours on a Saturday), most people end up ordering multiple hot dogs per person to justify the wait. Very nice owner. No seating until you've ordered your food.  If you get a regular dog, why bother? Go somewhere else. There are other places that do basic Chicago-style char-dogs better.
