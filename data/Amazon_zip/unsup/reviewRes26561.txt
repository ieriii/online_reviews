I must be in a really happy mood as I just handed out another 5 star rating to another pizza joint in the city. But gosh freakin dammit this city has THE BEST pizza in the world. Whether you like thin, deep dish, pan, or stuffed, Chicago has a pizza place that is the best of each variety. To the review of Pequod's. Somehow, as a lifelong Chicago area resident, I had never heard of this place until my transplanted St. Louis friends recommended it. Now I know why I call them friends - they point me to such heavenly places as Pequod's. A group of 3 of us ordered a large sausage and pepperoni Chicago style deep dish. It fed us comfortably and with two slices to spare. God bless the creators of this pie. The caramelized butter crust is as good as advertised in other Yelp reviews. The amount of meat stuffed in this pizza is really unbelievable. The service was outstanding - the waitress regularly refilled my pop when it got low. Those that live in the city understand what a rarity this is since most servers only want to bring you more drinks if it is a beer or some other "non free refill" beverage. We went on a Tuesday night and there was no wait. No parking lot which can be a bit of a pain but well worth it for an excellent Chicago style pizza place. ***Update: Mad props to them for keeping the kitchen open until 2am on Saturdays. Walked in there at 1:35am and they "happily" made us a pizza***
