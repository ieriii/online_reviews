Top notch!  Went here for dinner on a Friday night and encountered quick seating, great service and a spectacular meal. Started with the large House margarita pitcher and some chips/salsa/guacamole and they were nothing short of great!  We each had a different dish---chicken burrito, awesome----chicken quesadillas, killer----chicken ranchero, a bit spicy, but still a good bet.  Our server and bussers were terrific, very attentive and friendly.  A good time, a great meal.  We've been to some great Mexican places here in Chicago, and Mayan Palace sits pretty on top of that list!
