A group of us had dinner here last week to celebrate a friend's birthday and had a wonderful meal. We all did the three-course weeknight prix fixe. I had an appetizer (grilled polenta, delicious), entree (scallops, absolutely FABULOUS) and dessert (a friend and I split the lemon pannacotta and the chocolate hazelnut torte, both were very good). You can also get a pasta course instead of dessert if you prefer. It really is a great deal for $29...the scallops alone were priced at $23 on the menu. I took off one star because the alcohol there is kinda pricey (and we drank a lot of it) and the service just a bit slow (though we were a party of eight so perhaps that's par for the course). I'd definitely go back on a weeknight for the prix fixe. I hear they have a really nice patio out back in the summer too!
