After seeing the movie "Waiting," which is a sometimes humorous, sometimes just crude tale of what happens in restaurants behind the scenes, I learned one of the cardinal rules of dining: don't show up when it's close to closing time and act like a jerk. We walked in to the Bongo Room at 2:30 pm on a weekday when they were closing at three, toeing this line very closely.  They couldn't have been more accommodating and the two main items we ordered were two of the best versions of pancakes I've ever tasted. The items we ordered were both specials: red velvet pancakes and caramel covered zucchini pancakes.  Holy S**t! I can't describe them as anything other than the two sweetest, surprising and tastiest pancakes I've ever had. Take a chance on whatever they're doing as their specials that day, these were two inspired and unique tasting dishes. The portions were gargantuan, and we had plenty to bring home for a dessert in the future. Breakfast, dessert, its a nice one-two punch! Our coffee beverages were also tasty, this seems to generally be a strong point of theirs as well, from the various times I've visited. I think we were out of there by about 3:15 and we weren't even the last people out of the restaurant. Can't wait to go back to the Bongo Room next time I'm in Chicago. Oh, and if there's a long wait at Bongo Room, I would suggest trying Earwax about a block north on Milwaukee. Both great, great Chicago breakfast/brunch spots.
