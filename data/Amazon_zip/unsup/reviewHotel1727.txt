Stayed her for a night a few months back as a sort of mini-vacation. Dumb reason? Maybe. Tacky? Probably. But whatever, I didn't have any vacation time left! We were very impressed with the friendly, courteous and professional staff. The room was decked out like a little apartment with seperate dining, living, and bathroom areas, all spotless. The iPod docks are a cool treat, as well as the double sized whirlpool tub ;-) I'd definitely recommend this place to anyone from out of town or people who are spending an evening downtown from the suburbs, you can consider it as treating yourself!
