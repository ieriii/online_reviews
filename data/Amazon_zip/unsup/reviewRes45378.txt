So I have this thing about inattentive wait staff... If I'm there having some beers and I'm almost empty, I really expect you to ask me if I want more, not stop by, see my almost empty glass, come back later...see it now empty and then finally, the third time, I have to say "yea I'd like another beer"...the waiter replied, "oh okay." really? "oh okay"??? Now don't get me wrong, if I'm at a restaurant that happens to offer beer I am way more lenient. However, this place has the word Bar in its name...therefore, you should probably be a bit more on top of serving bar related things like beer. /end rant. The food was great to me, okay by my colleagues standards...a few of us went there prior to a play around the corner. I feel like the portions are ridiculously huge- so if you like leftovers this is a thumbs up. I'd try it again- but perhaps, I'd not consider this a go to spot for beverages...or at least during dinner time during the week..I have a feeling this place picks up and 'gets a bit Wilde" in the later evening hours...
