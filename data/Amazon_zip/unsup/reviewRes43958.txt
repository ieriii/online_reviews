For me it is a close race between Milk and Honey, and Goddess and the Grocer. This week Milk and Honey is winning! I forget the name of the sandwich i get but it is loaded with avocado and some mustard that I can't find anywhere else. The homemade chips are delicious and the ambiance is super cute. Just thinking about this place makes me smile. Oh and last time i ventured off from my fave sandwich and got a special salad with pomegranate seeds in it- this salad alone put Milk and Honey way ahead of Goddess and The Grocer...it was incredible.
