I'm old and grumpy. I'm a man's man. I like Football, Hockey fights and late night Reruns of the Rockford Files. I have lived in Chicago the majority of my life and I love Pizza. When I say Pizza, I mean Chicago Pizza. I'm talking about Pizza that lays in your stomach like a hockey puck. I'm talking about Pizza that's hot, solid, covered with enough Cheese, meat and sauce to make a Drunken Packer Fan's Gun go off in his holster. I'm not used to this Neapolitan, pansy food. But I have to admit, in this case, it was pretty good. We started out with this Giant Ball of Burrata Cheese which was their special appetizer of the day. This is what I mean when I talk about Guy food. The Burrata was the size of a football and delicious beyond words. It tasted like a different and wonderful version of Mozzarella cheese that I really enjoyed. For my entree I ordered their Diavola Pizza. Like I stated before, I really don't like Neapolitan Pizza, but this was by far the best one I ever had. The Diavola was topped with Cheese and Salami. It's not Lou Malnati's, but it was pretty damn good. The Bottom Line on Spacca Napoli is this: If you are going to get stuck going to some Foo Foo, Girly joint, Spacca Napoli is the lesser of all the evils. The food was pretty good and the service was top notch. There were moments where I actually enjoyed myself, just don't tell my wife, she may make me go to more places like this.
