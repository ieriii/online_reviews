If this was New York, I'd be out $2,000. Instead I put $56 bucks on my debit card. They say they don't take resos, but I called ahead and asked for a "note" to be taken. We passed the line, with no wait. Ambience is dramatic, if not theatrical. You can tell that the owners take pride in this place, and I can't think of a more aesthetically beautiful space for drinks, in Chicago or New York. Extensive bar list - with massive selection of liquors. I was impressed that we could have an experience like this and not be regretting it the next day. Makes me want to move to Chicago.
