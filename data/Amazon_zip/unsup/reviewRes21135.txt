The dog itself is great. The poppy-seed bun, pickle relish, mustard, onions and sport peppers were all standard, and good. The green tomato wedge I don't get. I can get past the tomato'less hot dog, but no celery salt, I can't get past that. I also had to finish dressing the dog my self; they didn't put the peppers on the dog, they just threw them in the container. Dog and fries for 5.50 is high in Chicagoland, the standard is two vienna beef dogs and fries for 4.99. They claim to make their own dog, which does give them a right to charge more (if true). French fries were krinkle fries, not my favorite and woefully short on salt. You can never truly salt a cold frie, so it really isn't an 'aftermarket' option. Neat place, FAR OFF the beaten path, which is why it took me 42 years to get there.  Neat drive-in-style hot dog joint. I did not try other menu items.
