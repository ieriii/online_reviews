I really miss this place. The staff are a litlte flirky (that means flirty and quirky) and sometimes appear to be high, but doesn't matter, the food delivers. Schwarma is always good, hummus ridiculous, tabouli, yes please. Spinach pie is a good starter. The only downside, which is like a rich people's problems downside, is that they stuff so much food into the pita, it doesn't always hold up. Again, I know...too much food is a rich person's problem. Everything is great and reasonably priced.  CASH ONLY.
