Fantastic place. Have eaten here twice in the last three weeks and have been meaning to review. Excellent rolls, would love to see a special roll of the day that is just not an item featured off the menu. You don't have to be that creative to make up a sushi roll. Service is excellent from the very friendly hosts to the multitude of servers who ensured all of our needs were met Martini's were perfect. I just wish the tables were a little farther apart. We ate out side and it was fine except for the proximity to the curb and being next to the most turned over parking spot in the city! Will definitely return!!
