MEAT. MEAT ON A STICK. SUCCULENT, JUICY, TENDER LOVING MEAT. Not to sound perverted or anything, but it's all about da MEAT at this spot. I skipped the salad bar to save some room for the main show, Uber attentive servers in their fancy shmancy outfits alternating between serving the different cuts and types of meats w/sweet pineapple. I didn't realize there was a way to stop the servers from serving us until I had a mountain pile of meat on my plate. haha. my bad. Brazzaz = a nice reminder of the true carnivore that I am.
