I've been going to Piece for over 4 years now and they never disappoint. Every time I'm in Chicago I make it a point to eat at this great, scratch that, WONDERFUL pizza place. Due to this said wonderfulness they often have ridiculous waiting times for a table, at the usual times on the usual days, so plan ahead.  However, you can look at this as an opportunity to drink one of the many beers they have on tap or in the bottle. I recommend trying one of theirs. Let's just say that they are not award winning for nothing! In addition to the wonderful pizza and beer, you might also like to try their salad. It's really, really good. Candied pecans! Oh yeah. For the Beatles happiness may be a warm gun, but for me it's coming to Piece with friends and family every time I'm in the windy city!
