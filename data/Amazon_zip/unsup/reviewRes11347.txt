I adore their food, but my unwillingness to wait outside for an hour while neverending droves of yuppies get their leisurely weekend brunch on makes Bongo Room a rare treat... And usually, I leave happy. However, this time I was floored by the asinine seating policies of their staff. We were told the wait for 2 people was 20-25 minutes, so we left, came back, and were still waiting 40 minutes later. Which is fine; it was crowded. However, we then watched two other parties (who got there after us) be seated first, and I finally had to speak up when, not one or two- but THREE- booths were cleaned and then left vacant while several couples of us stood around waiting to be seated (for a good 15 minutes).  When I mentioned to a server that we had been waiting for an hour and pointed out the many open booths, I was told "we don't sit parties of 2 at the booths." WTF?! Although brunch logic shows that the smaller the party, the shorter your wait for a table, you would rather have several couples loitering in the aisles, starving, for the amount of time it would take us to eat a meal and leave? And meanwhile, several booths sit unused...until a party of 4 chances in and is seated immediately?  Fortunately, we were seated a few minutes after the server went over to vent to the hosts about my complaint...but the fact that they don't have a better (or at least a common sense) strategy for the Sunday brunch rush is staggering. To be fair (2 hours later), I enjoyed my Breakfast Croissant Sandwich, and I appreciate that they do half-orders of the super-sweet pancakes for those of us who would just like a little taste. But the aggravation we had to endure means my next visit to Bongo Room will be even rarer.
