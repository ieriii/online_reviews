**************************** Disclaimer ******************************** The truth is I've decided to start reviewing places on yelp for selfish reasons (at least I'm honest). It seems I'm suffering from an acute case of Alzheimer's disease (don't feel bad though that's a self diagnosis) basically i can never remember which places I've liked, disliked, or even been to in most cases. So Ive decided to use Yelp for my electronic on-line restaurant memory card............. Oh yeah just so you know all my reviews are coming from the single male point of view of a man who loves women....................... ******************************* Review ********************************* 90 miles Cuban Cafe is GRRRRRRRR eat (in my tony the tiger voice). Went there yesterday with a couple friends, we all tried different Cuban sandwiches and wow they were good. Wait staff was nice and prices were more than reasonable. My favorite part was all the eye candy the place was filled with beautiful women as if there was security there turning away all the unattractive people away (couldn't have been the case because they let me in). The customers get 5 stars. The cafe it self will get its fifth star once Ive been back and tried another dish. If I'm just as satisfied then i will update my rating....................
