This is one of those places that I find really hard to review because the food was so indescribably good. And the decor and hoppin' atmosphere--NYE or not--made me feel like I was dining on some side street in Old San Juan again. To make the most of this visit, the man and I started off with the yuca frita appetizer. These fries were crispy and addicting with that delicious tangy yet strangely kind of sweet garlic sauce. If you've never had yuca, have no fear--these were much closer to potatoes than I thought they'd be, albeit slightly starchier and some bites stringy. Entrees were the rabo and ropa vieja. For anybody complaining that you're getting a lot of bones with the rabo, pay attention to what you're ordering because that's what oxtail is. Don't be dainty--get in there and clean the meaty goodness off, which is not hard to do because the meat is so tender it slides off the bone. And the sauce it was in *swoon*. The ropa was good, but I'm very glad I stuck to my guns for once and ordered the oxtail. Didn't pay much attention to the black beans, but mostly because I'd had plenty of them the night before so I wasn't interested. Besides, I had caramelized sweet plantains and rice that needed to be inhaled. So simple, yet so ridiculously good and satisfying. The rice in particular was a bit of a surprise for how flavorful it was despite looking like basic rice. As for service--perfect by my standards. We were greeted with a smile by our hostess, who quickly led us to our table in the back part of the place. Our server was friendly and just attentive enough, even insisting on stabilizing our table when he noticed it was wobbling. I would totally go back and it's probably a good thing (for me) that I don't live closer, otherwise I'd be there all the time.
