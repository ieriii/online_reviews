My parents were in town over the weekend and wanted to experience a great Chicago steak.  We read the reviews on Yelp and decided on Kinzie. We were not disappointed. The service was excellent. Our waiter was friendly and very helpful. The steaks were fabulous. My husband and I split the 18 oz delmonico (btw they don't charge a split fee). It was by far the juiciest, most flavorful cut of meat we had had in a very long time. I also felt it was a great value. The a la carte items are good portions that can be split. In my opinion, Kinzie is a much better value than the other chop houses in town!!
