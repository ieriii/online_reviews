This may be one of my favorite new places to go. I live just around the corner from here and I have to say having a place like this to stop in after work is fantastic. I usually come in for a drink and may some snacks. The pretzel with rarebit is my favorite. Also the St. Ambroise stout on top doesn't hurt either. If I was a whiskey drinker I would probably add another star, but I am definately fine with the beer selection, man is it good.
