If you haven't gone here yet - you would be surprised to know that it was under your knows... well, under the traintracks and you have never noted it in all those years. That's what happened to me. I knew of the name, but never found it. It's hidden - on purpose. When you open the rusticated doors, you enter into a new world which is both pleasant an mysterious. What they offer is somewhere in between spectacular and ineffable - it's that good. However, I just have one qualm which has more to do with my style than what they offer. When I go out, I'm there to socialize, have fun, talk... you know the protocol. The seating and setup at this place is quite rigid. By rigid, I mean it is not necessarily conducive to conversation with a group of friends as it's hard to seat any friends. Perhaps if you are meeting someone that you know exceptionally well and the main purpose of you going here is to appreciate what they have to offer and save the lengthy conversation for something later - makes total sense. All in all, the staff is incredible. The place is exceptionally clean and I left happy. I will return again with a good friend. But, like I said, I probably won't go there with someone I am meeting for the first time - my style.
