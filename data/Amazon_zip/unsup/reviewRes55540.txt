I've been here two times and luckily, i didn't experience the long wait. Anyways, this place has good food. However, tables are so close that you could easily hear someone's conversation two tables over. The second time i went there, i was sat to a table that was only 3 inches away from me. It was by the corner. I had the breakfast burrito, it was good. Also tried the french tower toast. Yes, it's amazing hands down. But, there's a catch. There is sooooo muuuuucccccchhhhhhhh calories in that thing that will hold you back the entire day. I regret eating it. Yet, it's something good once in a while, as in maybe every six months for a little taste. Not something to get used too though.
