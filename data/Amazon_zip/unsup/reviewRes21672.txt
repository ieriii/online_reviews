I'm not trying to be a hater but if you do not like Xoco's food then you do not know food and perhaps should stick to Taco Bell. I understand the other complaints; long lines, weird and cramped space, etc. Yeah, all true. But the food? Get outta here. Just thinking about it makes me want to have a barbacoa gorgefest.
