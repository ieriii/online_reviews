Never thought to check out Shaw's because I actually heard their seafood was just average. HOWEVER, after reading "Consider the Oyster" my fellow oyster lover girlfriend and I went to check out their Oyster Bar which is open basically all day.  Good selection of oysters, mostly C.virginicas and only a couple C.gigas. But they shuck them right in front of you and taste very very fresh. After trying one of each, we both had to order another 3 of our favorite kind along with a second beer (very decent beer selection BTW. We had the local IPA, a non-goose island) I actually don't recommend the oyster shooter. They put too much, well, stuff in it. The horseradish, pepper, and cocktail sauce was a bit too overwhelming and I couldn't even taste the oyster!  Anyway, overall quite an enjoyable oyster experience. Even the service was nice and attentive, albeit a bit too flirty. I can't comment on any other food, but just go sit at the Oyster Bar and try the selection.
