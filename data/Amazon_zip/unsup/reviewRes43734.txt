There are a million great places to eat in the wicker park/bucktown area, but few provide quality gourmet sandwiches that you can order on a whim and take somewhere else to enjoy. It seems like everywhere to eat in the city requires you to sit down and order to get something good. Here you can order a sandwich and take it home to enjoy in under ten minutes. Also I like that it is an order and then sit down type of place. You don't have to wait for a waitress to eventually show up to take your order, you wait in line, order and then sit down. Again in under ten minutes its brought to you to enjoy. Fabulous food and quick service, great for breakfast, lunch or a quick meal on the go!
