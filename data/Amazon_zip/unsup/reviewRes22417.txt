I brought my (Chinese) mom here the last time she was in town and we were craving some spicy food. We ordered a couple of dishes off the "recommended" list - yu xiang pork, the pea sprouts with garlic, and the "House Special" hot and sour soup. That hot and sour soup changed my life. It is probably the BEST hot and sour soup I've ever had. The pork was also quite delicious - usually I go for the boiled beef, but you really have to be up for the whole soaked-in-chili-oil deal, and we were more in the mood for a medium spicy with veggies dish, and this dish definitely did it. And if you've never had pea sprouts/shoots before, you should definitely try the ones at Lao Sze Chuan, they have a light garlicy sauce on them and are a great for breaking up the burn in your mouth.
