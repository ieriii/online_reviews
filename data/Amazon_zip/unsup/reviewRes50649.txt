Being the offspring of two South Siders, I never tasted anything remotely southern until I went to college down in mid Illinois. Even then it was dumpster quality at best, but I grew to appreciate the necessary spice and thick flavors of southern and especially cajun cooking. I had Big Jones over a month ago so I can't quite remember all the appetizers we had, but the crab cakes were so good I contemplated throwing out all my thousands of years of instilled civility to kill my table mates for more, it was like learning to share all over again. For dinner I had the alligator sausage. Boss. Yes that's a descriptive word from the 90s but it can't be helped. The sausage was full of flavor and coupled nicely with some assorted greens. It went welll with the scottish ale I had off the beer list too. Quick word on the beer list, it will definitely open you up to a great new assortment of brews, but if you're a traditionalist, they got PBR. The atmosphere was very pleasent, it helped that we spent most of our meal as practically the only customers. The staff was friendly, good conversationalists, and even demostrated where parts of the pig came from using their own bodies. This only got weird once, but my knowledge of select cuts of meat will never be the same.
