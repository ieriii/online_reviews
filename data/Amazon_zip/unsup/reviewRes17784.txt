I was hesitant to visit this place at first because of its Gold Coast location - I've generally found the best Indian food in hole-in-the-wall places, not gargantuan establishments with valet parking. I was pleasantly surprised though. Our servers were wonderful. My water glass was never less than half full. We ordered enough food to feed an army (there were only two of us) because I wanted to try everything and have no problems having leftovers for lunch the next day. We got the Dahi Aloo Poori (potatoes + yogurt and tamarind sauce over thin crackers), fish tikka masala, Aloo Gobi, and their Tandoori Special, plus rice and naan. I wouldn't mind skipping the Dahi Aloo Poori next time, but the main dishes were incredible. the Aloo Gobi was probably the best I'd ever had. We also had the mango ice cream for dessert and it was the perfect way to cleanse our pallet. I was so full by the end of the meal, almost unable to walk. So why three stars? We had a huge basket of naan left over because I placed an extra order on top of what they give you with the Tandoori special. As I dug into my lunch the next day, guess what was missing? My naan. I don't know if this was intentional or a simple mistake, but if you have naan left over and expect it with your meal, be sure to ASK for it. I had a sorely disappointing lunch the next day.
