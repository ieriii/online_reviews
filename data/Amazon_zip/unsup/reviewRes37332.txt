To review Fox and Obel is to compare it to Dominick's, Treasure Island, and Trader Joe's. I tried to make an elaborate analogy to the March sisters in Little Women, but 45 minutes later, I am tired and hungry. Each grocery store is actually a pretty good representation of its immediate surroundings. Fox and Obel is expensive. It contains many varieties of high-class artistic food, an excellent bakery, and good coffee. It is for people who live in lower Streeterville, frequent the art galleries nearby, impress people with their high-rise view of Navy Pier, and drink a lot of quality coffee. Treasure Island is for the quiet older demographic of upper Streeterville/Gold Coast. It is dead quiet, there are no lines or shrills. The food is for those with a discerning palette and very sensitive ears. Trader Joe's is in the middle of River North's sea of restaurants, shops, galleries, and bars. It is full of beautiful people who appreciate beauty in all things. It is busy, loud, and colorful. Dominick's is a subsidiary of Safeway Inc. and as a profit-maximizer it chooses to differentiate itself from the other three by being what they are not: cheap (for downtown Chicago) and huge. If something is not available at any of the top three, then it is probably here.
