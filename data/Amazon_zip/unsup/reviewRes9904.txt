So proud of Mr.Man for making a dinner reservation on New Years! This restaurant is really a little hidden gem that from the outside looks nice enough but who would of known the delights coming out of the kitchen. Everyone there was so helpful. Service was amazing. I cannot wait to come back and eat outside on the patio.  You know how some restaurants try to make up for their lackluster food by serving it to you in mammoth sized bowls? Not here. No need to stuff me since the food was satisfying and delicious. The portions were the perfect size. One more of the farrow triangles and I would be done in. Roll me home. Light dishes that served the perfect punch. The perfect place to dine out for a special occasion.
