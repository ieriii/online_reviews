I didn't even have that high of hopes for this place beside the hundreds of 5 star yelp votes.. I just don't get the big boner over this place. The ambiance is.... dark. The booths are green and plastic, it's hotter than hell in there and you don't really see any of the "sexy" that people are talking about. The drink I had was OK. I like whiskey but by no means am a connoisseur. They didn't have the first two I ordered in stock and I settled on something I didn't know much about. About 35 mins later my drink (along with my girlfriends) came out and it was OK, I guess. It was probably about the size of 2 shots in a large whiskey glass without ice so it really looked like nothing. I sipped on it, but honestly how much time should it take to sip 2oz worth of liquid?? Not worth the wait, not worth the $32 for 2 drinks. I gave it 2 stars because maybe it'd be more fun to go with a group of 6-8 and each person had a quick $50 to burn. Maybe I didn't go on the right night.. Don't care to go back and try again.
