Um... Cashew Butter sandwich with fig and cheese accompanied by one of about a million different beers to select from... what's not to love about Hopleaf! If you're a beer lover you have to check out this place but be prepared to wait on most evenings. It's well worth the wait and the food menu will keep you coming back just as much as the beer selection.
