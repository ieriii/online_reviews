I loved this place!!! Had dinner here with my sister earlier today and felt in love. -What I mainly loved was the service the owner provided. I have never connected in such level with the owner of the restaurant like I did with him. He made us feel as we were his nieces and family. He blessed us (with a shot of european liquor) and hugged us goodbye. -The food was well portioned and good. For appetizers we had the Saganaki Oppa! (make sure you have your camera ready to capture the flame), Bruschetta, and the Mussels; and for entree we had the Chicken Schnitzel, all was delicious. We received everything in a fast manner. -There was live music, soft jazz. - :( The only negative I have to say is the waitress was horrible. The owner was more attentive and precise than the waitress. Needless to say she did not receive a tip from us. -The service (aside from the waitress), the food and the atmosphere was amazing. We'll be coming back :)
