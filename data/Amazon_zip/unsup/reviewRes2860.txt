Disclaimer: I went here for a drug rep dinner. The food served at these things is usually inferior to what a restaurant normally serves. I'm pretty sure this was the case when I went. The meal started with a lobster bisque which was wonderfully rich but a bit too salty. This was followed by the main course, a beef tenderloin with onion tart. The tenderloin was not overdone, but tasted more like a sirloin than a tenderloin. How can a restaurant like Tru serve a cut of steak that is too tough?! It made me sad. The onion tart was delicious. Highlight of the meal: dessert. Gale Gand did not disappoint! I had had a terrible day prior to dining here and the baked chocolate mousse with raspberries made me completely forget this. I went home and had a dream about this phenomenal dish. I have a list of restaurants I would try if I ever felt inclined to drop $100+ on my dinner. This is still on my list. I really believe (and hope) a regular (non drug rep) dinner would be an overall outstanding experience.
