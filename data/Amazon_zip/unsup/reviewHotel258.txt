It a relativity a well kept hotel and the staff are very accommodating. It is however just another Holiday Inn...nothing out of the extra ordinary to mention. However, there is a lot of family staying so it is loud and usually have a lot of kids running around. The restaurant needs a little work, it just a pizza place that attached.
