Really one of the best Italian restaurants in Chicago. I came here for my birthday back in May and before that, I went before Christmas. It is great. Every time I want to go out to a nice dinner for an occasion, this the place to go. The owner is from Pisa. There is a waiter from Venice or Trieste. Everybody is so nice and the food is delicious and very filling. Whether you want a cream based or tomato sauce, everything is so tasty. Try the baked Alaska for dessert. The interior of this place is beautiful as well. Also, I'm surprised that there are some bad reviews. The people who wrote them must not be Italian or be familiar with Italian food.
