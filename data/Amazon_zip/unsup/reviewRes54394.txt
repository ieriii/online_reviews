This pizza is one of my favorite's in the city. And that says alot considering Chicago is known for pizza. The crust is magnificent...buttery, soft, and crispy at the same time. It comes out piping hot. Add a cold beer with good pizza and you can't go wrong. I like to stop here before catching a show at the Webster Place theater across the street. Great spot if the Cubs are playing too since the games are always on.
