The best part of the night was the fact that we were not rushed. I just hate how some servers make you feel rushed to order right away. The menu had a great assortment of choices. The deserts were fantastic and in huge portions. WORST PART - We brought a bottle of Stag's Leap in to celebrate our friend's engagement. The server said that the rule is "to either pay the corking fee OR give the server a taste". We thougth he was joking - until he POURED HIMSELF A LARGER GLASS AND EVEN TOPPED HIS OWN GLASS OFF WITH THE LAST DRIP! Totally unclassy.
