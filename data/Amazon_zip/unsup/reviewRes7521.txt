A gal pal and I dined here Friday night. We hadn't hung out in over a year so I may not have been as observant as usual... It was my second visit here--the first was with a big group in 2006. From my perspective, this is a nice place conveniently located in a neighborhood that doesn't boast that many "real" restaurants. Lots of first dates, friend dates and groups...and despite the fact that I've mentioned groups twice, I can't figure out why it's so noisy! (But is was.) The food: Friend and I opted to share the Stella salad and seafood risotto. Without being asked, the kitchen split both dishes for us and most importantly, we WERE NOT charged for this inconvenience. Nor were we made to feel bad about having wimpy girly stomachs. Very good. The salad was good, but I would have preferred a little less dressing. I'm picky though. The risotto was great--VERY generous portions of most everything--but after 3 pieces of bread, I couldn't finish it. Note: Each table gets its own thing of parmesan and olive oil = dangerous. Love that a large Pellegrino is only $5 and the waitress remembered the extra limes. She wasn't the most attentive, but she was very efficient and we didn't have to flag her down when we wanted the check. Again, important and good. The manager looked familiar, but gave me a crazy look when I asked if I knew him from somewhere. Why do I include this? Dunno, just so you'll know that it ended on an awkward note. All-around, it was solid, not special. I always forget about those $12 coupons, but if you can snag one of those, it's an even better deal!
