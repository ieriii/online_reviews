Every dinner in Greektown is ended by a trip here. Among the best greek desserts I've ever had. I'd try to list them but the spelling isn't exactly intuitive. Trust me, go here for coffee and dessert and you won't be disappointed. Funnily enough, there seems to be a horde of Slavic waitstaff here for some reason... Cheaper labor?
