good comfort food....but my FAVORITE reason for eating here / aside from the decent prices and the comfortable environment...is YOU GET TO PICK YOUR OWN SIDES...that is great.... not a fancy, fancy place...but so love the selections and the sides...I am a big fan of the red beans / hopping jack / and the sauteed spinach...with whatever....good specials... they also do good wine flights...and have a good (but small) beer selection.... but it is a restaurant, not a bar with food....if you want that, go to Coopers...
