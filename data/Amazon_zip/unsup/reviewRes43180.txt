This is a great little spot if you just want to grab a quick bite to eat during the week, however I don't think that they should consider themselves a brunch place. You walk in, place your order at the counter and then you are given a number and a place to sit. Which I really appreciate that they don't make you fend for yourself when it comes to finding a seat. The food was really good and I'm more than satisfied with that! I was just expecting brunch with Mimosa's. When it was actually just extended hours for breakfast and the ability to order Huevos Rancheros. I would definitely go back, just not for weekend brunch.
