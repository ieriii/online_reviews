The only time I've ever eaten inside, I got a caprese panini which was alright. The pasta bowl happens to be one of the most popular places that the pharmaceutical companies use to cater to us when they come to our clinic! Soooo, I have tried many dishes... just not actually IN the restaurant. They have a lovely spinach salad that is very good. They also have a farfalle and chicken dish which I always enjoy. Also their generalized rigatone is a winner. I wasn't too impressed when I actually sat down in the restaurant though. The service was average and the caprese panini was average. Anyway, although I was not wowed, I have no complaints, so carry on, pasta bowl.
