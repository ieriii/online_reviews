I think this is one of the great dining experiences in this country. We have been to several excellent restaurants, and this rates above all of them in our estimation. This was our second time at Tru, and the wait staff (I don't know what to call them really; they are true professional servers with vast knowledge of the food) remembered us from our previous time there. The service is beyond excellent; nothing is left to chance. On this night, the food was as exceptional as the first time. The fusion of flavors, the mousse with the halibut, the foie gras, the caviar with avocado, it was all very good and like nothing we had tasted before. The sommelier was very helpful and talked to us about various wines to drink with our dinner. We chose a French Chablis and it was the perfect accompaniment. Tru is very pricey; there is no getting around that. But for that one dinner per year where you really want to splurge and enjoy yourself with no looking back, this is an exceptional choice.
