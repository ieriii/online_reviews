Pequod's used to be one of my favorite pizza spots in Chicago; after my recent experience with them I will never order from the again.After and hour and 40 minutes of placing my order I still had no pizza. I called to ask the status, the girl who answered was less than pleasant. When the pizza finally arrived, it was completely wrong. Wanted vegetarian and got all meat toppings. I called to complain and was only offered a $5 discount on my next pizza (oh excuse me, they would send me a new pizza but I think after an 1:40 minutes I would've been on to my next meal.)  At least offer a free pizza!! NEVER ordering from them again.
