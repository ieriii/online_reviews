I should've known better based on the Gold Coast location...but I gave it a try because it was in the A La Card deck.  Pros: gorgeous, romantic decor; attentive & down-to-earth servers Cons: overpriced versions of Vietnamese staples I can get on Argyle for half the price The Lotus Root & Fried Tofu Salad was much bigger than I expected, basically entree-size, which was a welcome surprise but after a while I just felt saladed-out. The flavors were sharp, tangy, and refreshing--though I was expecting circular lotus roots, not thin lotus spears. I also tried the Shrimp & Veggie "Beignets", which don't even deserve to be called beignets, as they were glorified stuffed crispy spring rolls. Tasty and certainly greasy, but otherwise nothing like their namesake. I had the Lemon Tart for dessert--which was lovely-- light, simple, and fresh.  Basically, a good-enough meal, but nothing out of the ordinary that I would need to go back and experience again.
