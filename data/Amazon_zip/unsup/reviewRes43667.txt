Ok, I started off loving this place because of their super yummy granola. And then my girlfriend and I began a Sunday morning brunch ritual later, and loved it even more. They have a very simple and straight forward menu, which I appreciate, and the waitstaff is very helpful and nice. I really enjoy the huevos rancheros that they only serve on the weekends, and they have a rotating pancake that is always good. Don't forget a couple of lavender/lemon cookies to go too. Prices are very reasonable. I guess the reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is that it can get really busy, and the way they take orders and give people numbers while they wait, makes this place feel a bit discombobulated. It seems that half the people in the restaurant are waiting to sit down. And of course, then they want to turn over table quick too. Don't bring the paper and expect a quiet place to read for an hour after you've finished. But all that to say, it's one of my more favorite spots for brunch.
