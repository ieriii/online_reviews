I'm shocked at myself for not writing a review sooner considering that I've been a loyal patron to The Gage for over a year now. The Gage is my Chicago, I've recently moved back to NYC after a year-long stint in Chicago, it wasn't my city and quite frankly I wasn't a huge fan. However, I truly do miss the Roasted Woodland Mushroom Sandwich on the lunch menu at this place. It is a great vegetarian option (although I am not) because it's hardy and filling. The staff is great, 9/10 times I sit and have lunch at the bar and I am always greeted by Kevin, James, Sarah, or Amy who are all rockstars (the bartenders). I come for the food, and I stay for the company, these are some of the most genuine bartenders I've had the pleasure of meeting during my stay in Chicago. If they don't know my name, which I'm sure they do, they at least recognize that a menu is not needed and put my order in upon sitting down.  I highly recommend The Gage to anyone and everyone! The service is great. The food is phenomenal. The value is incredible. I have flown to Chicago for only a few hours only to lunch here and see my favorite bartenders, and I intend on continuing my day trips when I have the chance, although it is definitely a pain in the ass to pick up and fly to Chicago on a whim, and although I'm secretly hoping they bring The Gage to NYC... I know it wouldn't be the same.
