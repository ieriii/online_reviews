Not as great as I remembered, but still good. I hadn't been here in about a year or so, so last weekend I suggested that my partner and I go Saturday night. He had never been. We got there a bit before 6pm and were told there'd be a 30 minute wait for a table for two. The bar was packed, so we stood around and watched a previously aired Knicks game. Lin-sanity. Once seated (in a pretty great seat away from the craziness, but near a drafty window) we quickly figured out what we wanted. My partner had the Golden Arm beer and I had the stout. We put out food orders in with our drink orders - a plain pizza with sausage and red peppers and an order of chips and guac. Seemed like a weird appetizer at a pizza place but we went with it. Drinks came right out, I loved mine. The chips and guac came quickly, and I inhaled my portion. The pizza came out pretty quickly for how crowded the place was. I was pleasantly surprised. The pizza was good, but not amazing and not something I'd want to wait a long time to get a table for. I'm glad we went, but I was expecting a bit more from the pizza.
