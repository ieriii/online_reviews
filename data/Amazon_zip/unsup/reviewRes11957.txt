The wait was loooooong. Of course, on a Sat morning for brunch and peeps would come out after eating and say it was worth the wait... Hmph The wait: about an hour for 4 of us. But we had some coffee, waited outside on the beautiful day and walked into the nearby stores... with our coffee in hand The peeps: all the peeps who have yelped it and hearing about the hype. The locals wouldn't be so silly The food: -Breakfast burrito: mediocre. Could have it anywhere else -Red velvet pancake. Ordered 1 after we saw another table just order 1. We got reprimanded by out waitress when we put this order in a few minutes later. She said, they don't usually put in late orders like this especially with the wait outside that's so long. Dude... we just waited for over an hour... give us the damn pancake. This was sooooo sweet and the consistency of the pancake caked to the roof of my mouth -Chocolate tower french toast. Again tooo sweet. My friend only ate 1/6 of it -Steak benedict: mediocre.  -Chicken, basil, egg white omelette: good, but not worth the wait. -Bacon pancakes with banana praline sauce. Delicious. Decadent. Again, can't eat more than a few bites. But enough salty/ smokiness from the bacon to make you go... "hmm? what's that" But not greasy or anything. Then smothered with fresh bananas, which were delightful and a buttery thick praline sauce but almost jaw achingly sweet. -The hubs orders bacon and over easy eggs... which he can easily make at home, but orders at a restaurant anyway -Fabulous coffee. The price for 4? $85 ($100 with tip). A bit pricey. And they try to shuffle you out.
