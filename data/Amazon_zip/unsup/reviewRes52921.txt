I recently tried 90 miles for the second time as I was looking for delivery other than pizza. I really liked their croquetas which aren't too greasy and are served with this delicious dipping sauce. Yes, I had them on both visits. Also I enjoyed a media noche (midnight sandwich) - being from Miami, I have experienced authentic real Cuban food, but i have to say theirs isn't too bad, a bit on the dry side, but has potential. Next time I'll try the Cuban sandwich or an entree. A plus of this place is that it's a BYOB - can't go wrong there. Also their patio is open all year - in winter they cover & heat it up...nice aspect of the joint.
