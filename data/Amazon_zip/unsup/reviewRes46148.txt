The decor alone is worth the trip and if you can get seated by a window, you'll have lot's to look at  Like the size of the restaurant, the menu is HUGE, so good luck picking something out - lot's of good salads and the lunch portion IS big enough.  Food's usually pretty good. Order the fresh made desserts with your entree if you want chocolate chip cookies or beignets fresh out of the oven delivered as you finish your meal.
