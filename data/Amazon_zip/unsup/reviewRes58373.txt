I really appreciated what was happening here. From the moment I walked in I felt like I was in someone's home. It didn't have the I'm so precious feeling that sometimes new places give off. There seemed to be a central energy and a happy feeling buzzing around it. We were seated in the lounge area while waiting for a table. I liked the darkness there amidst orange glowing light bulbs. We were greeted right away by a server who just wanted to say hi and give us time to look over the cocktail list.  We ended up getting a couple, the sazerac and the martinez--both top notch. Before our drinks were finished a table opened up by the kitchen. It was fun to watch the chefs in there doing their thing, not to mention the wonderful smells near it. Our food  was simply, simply scrumptious. We got the croque madame which was a big hot messy delight! Our server was right on top of everything, nice but not intrusive. We ended up with a brownie sunday and some homemade almond joys. Woah. I want to come back here and rummage through the beer list, which was impressive. Bravo Gilt; we'll be back, for sure.
