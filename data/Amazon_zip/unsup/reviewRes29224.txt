I was 1 of the friends that Jennifer Q. went out with this weekend. I agree with all the great reviews about this place! The only thing I don't understand is why it takes so long to get reservations. I don't see what the big deal is! I mean the food is excellent and quite flavorful, but I think there's a lot more hype to this place than it needs. When we left the place there were people waiting to be seated & the wait time was 2 1/2 hours! I would NOT wait that long for any restaurant!
