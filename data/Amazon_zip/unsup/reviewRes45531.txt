This place has gotten more expensive than I remember it; seems to me that they have probably raised the prices over time. As another reviewer said, a burger for $12+ does have you asking yourself "hm, really??" That being said, the upscale English pub feel is nice, and the food is not amazing, but solid. I would recommend going to chill out during an off-peak time, close to the open windows towards the front side of the restaurant, even if you can't snag one of the seats on the patio (which tends to be on the shadier side most times that I have passed by there), and grab some of the great curried mussels to go with your beer(ss). Afterwards, you'll appreciate the handsomely decorated bathrooms. If you're on the hungrier side, I highly recommend the Irish curried chicken dish. It comes off as being decidedly not Indian. :)
