WORST BAR EVER. Seriously, we are not in LA people. What is with the pretension? My hot sister and 2 hot girlfriends waited in line for 2 hours to have a drink. The hostess and bouncer were so embarrassed that they couldn't get us in, that they actually stopped speaking to us! For real. No reservations? Apparently the girl inside was allowed to plan a party for 40+ friends that got VIPed inside each time they cut in front of us in line. The trick is to show up the week before in person and strike a deal. Why did we wait? We just wanted to talk to each other and drinking was not a priority. Finally a guy across the street at Pontiac was so ashamed of our wait, he offered us free pot and drinks to just leave the line. He was embarrassed for all of Chicago. As he should have been.
