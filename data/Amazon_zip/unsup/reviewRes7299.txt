I had a lovely dinner here last Saturday with my mom. We sat in the back room, and it was cozy and warm. We started with the butternut squash soup. Heavenly. Thick and rich and perfect for a chilly fall evening. I've been on a lobster kick since travelling in the Canadian Maritimes last summer, so I had to try the lobster ravioli. It was fantastic! The lobster wasn't as good as on the North Atlantic, of course, but it was just as good as anything I've had in the midwest. I loved the rich pink sauce that, I'm sure, went straight to my thighs. Worth it, though. I thought the portion was a tad small, but then again, it's lobster and it has to get flown in, so I get it. My mom had a pasta dish with lots of seafood. The seafood, again, was good, but I wasn't crazy about the sauce. It didn't have the flavour explosion of the lobster ravioli, for sure. Her dish was huge--she only ate about half, whereas I finished my ravioli easily. We tried their featured Pinot Grigio, which was a great decision. Now I just wish I remembered what it was, besides "something Italian." The service was perfect--we were seated right away and our waiter was polite and friendly, but not so friendly that it gets obnoxious. Our entrees were about $22 each, I think, and the wine was $8/glass. Completely reasonable for a nice dinner with my mom. I'll certainly go back!
