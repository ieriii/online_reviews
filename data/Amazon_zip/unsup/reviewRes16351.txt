Greasy, gross, and overpriced, with bad service/attitude. Worst of all, I spent $20 on takeout food for one person. Will not be back. Ever. I asked for recommendations and wanted vegetable vindaloo, which the guy on the phone informed me they "don't have." BULLSHIT. You have chicken vindaloo, and you can make a vegetarian version. He then recommended a dish with a lot of cheese, which I explained that I didn't want (after having Uno's earlier). So he recommended a veggie jalfrezi. Little did I know, that was also chock full of oily cheese chunks. I ate what I could salvage from the container, but it was bathed in a disgusting layer of oil. I am getting queasy reliving this experience, actually. Did I finish even half of this food? HELL TO THE NO. ps: If you still want to take a chance on this food don't ask to order delivery unless you're OK with paying $6.95 extra!! When I heard this I told them that I would pick it up myself as I was within walking distance.
