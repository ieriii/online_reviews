Delish. The hubby and I wanted to do brunch on Sunday and when I thought of Longman & Eagle, it showed that it was closed. We decided to do a drive-by and was ecstatic that it was open! We sat outside, along a white fence and herb boxes. Our server, Alex, was outstanding. He was friendly and very passionate about "selling" us the food and the concept of Longman & Eagle. The brunch menu had so many good options that I decided to order the peeky toe crab benedict. Anything benedict is my favorite brunch meal. The hubby got the pork belly sandwich with the leafy salad. The crab benedict was heaven. The eggs were perfectly poached, the crab was decadent, the potatoes were creamy and the bacon was fabulous. The first bite was smokey and crisp but then it finished with a sweet taste. One of the best bacon pieces I have had. While we were waiting for our brunch to come out, Alex gave us the dinner menu to look over. I am not lying when I say that I could eat every single item off the menu! I can't wait to come back to sample the dinner fare. Longman & Eagle is one of these places where you could sample every single item on the menu and still come back for more. And that's what I plan on doing.
