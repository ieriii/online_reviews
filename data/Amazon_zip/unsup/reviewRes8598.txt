Simply the best Brazilian Steakhouse I've been to. It's expensive, but no other place gives you the quality of meat and the atmosphere that is available at this Fogo restaurant. The meat comes often and plentiful. Fogo has some of the best side dishes (po de queijo polenta and caramelized bananas) than any other Brazilian Steakhouses. It's so hard not to get filled up on those. However, I personally feel like it doesn't matter if you tell them you want medium or medium rare, they just seem to cut whatever. Their salad bar looks nice, but I always skip it. (You don't come to a place like this for salad bar.) Ah, and their sausage. Why you would go to a steak house and get sausage? Try the sausages here and you'll know why. You won't be disappointed!!
