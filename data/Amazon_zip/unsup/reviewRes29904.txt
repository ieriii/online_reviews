french toast + bananas + banana liquer + candied walnuts + brie + whipped cream = party in your mouth! The stuffed french toast was amazing (especially after we took out the brie.. yeah, it was just a little too weird for me). It's also super sweet, so make sure you have a cup of coffee or glass of water nearby. But apparently my friend thought it wasn't sweet enough so he doused it in syrup.. root canal waiting to happen. My friend ordered the veggie hash, which was surprisingly delicious. It comes with bits of brocolli and other veggies inside, which almost makes you think you're eating something healthy. Yummy!! =D Bonus point: they serve up some great coffee. =) Service is nothing to complain about. They don't bug you, they're responsive, and they're quick.
