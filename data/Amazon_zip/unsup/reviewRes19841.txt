Seriously, you all had it better. Maybe I had a high expectation after reading all the reviews here. But seriously. The consistency of rice is the most critical aspect of good shushi. I had their shushi combo and the rice was so dry and hard that I could almost feel individual rice in my mouth. YUCK! And plus, given the awful taste of the food and the price, this is not the place to go. The decoration is really dark; the whole atmosphere is just not welcoming or friendly. I agree with some of the reviewers here. If you are BYOB, be BYOB.
