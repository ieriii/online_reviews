PHO!! I should end the review here, however I won't! Everything is awesome (except spring rolls - you should skip that). This place is always croweded so be prepared. They do a decent job of turning over the tables and they are quick with your orders. I think I've eaten most things on the menu (even the cow testicles) and it's all quallity and reasonably priced (even the testicles). There's a reason this place is popular - because it's good. Venture out and support a great Uptown establishment.
