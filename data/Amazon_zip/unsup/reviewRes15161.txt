Totally Cheesy decor in and out. The bar, which is the first thing you see when you walk in, looks like it's from the 60's/70's. Last time I was there they had two old guys serenading the patrons, but they were so bad it was comical. But the food, wine, service, and price are all to die for. This is true old school charm. This is the place I love to go to on my Birthday.
