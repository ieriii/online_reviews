OK, who is this Sultan and where can I find him? I would like to thank him for this wonderful little spot where I can get some of the best middle eastern food around.  Seriously, I feel naughty just thinking about how good it is. I was always a Pita Inn girl until my sister introduced me to Sultan's. Best chicken schwarma and falafel I've ever eaten and I love that they not only put tahini sauce in their sandwiches, but hummos, as well. And...who doesn't love the little cold bar! Olives and dolmas and shrimp, oh my. They also have a tasty litle apricot vegan cookie that has some sort of aromatic floral ingredient that just makes me melt.  Good Stuff!!!!
