Had lunch here, and I'm now a fan. It's too bad I live in Lincoln Park and seldom travel to the South Loop for anything and probably would not for this place. But, it comes highly recommended, at least from what I saw and ate during lunch. The beet salad was tasty, especially with the side of brie crisp potatoes. Yummo. On second thought, I would love to go back for dinner and peruse their beer list.
