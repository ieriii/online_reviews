The most important thing about an establishment such as this is whether or not the bartenders can MAKE A DRINK. Where cocktail bars fall short, such as Bourbon and Branch did in the beginning, is when they focus on style over substance. I was concerned upon entering Violet Hour that the house rules would unfortunately define my experience. Let me just say that I'm thankful we were put at the bar and not in a booth. Dealing directly with the bartender is always the best policy.  Every drink was expertly made. I started with a Sazerac. The balance of flavors was exactly right, although I prefer a slightly bigger presence of citrus. The second drink was a spin-off of a Blood and Sand, Bourbon being substituted for Scotch. I missed the Scotch, but I still very much enjoyed the drink. Finally, I requested a Queenspark Swizzle. I noticed they had a decent selection of rums, so I figured, why the hell not? It was delicious!  The food, always secondary to the drinks, wasn't out-of-this-world great like Alembic's grub, but it's certainly good and the menu is worth exploring. Standouts are the minidogs and coconut shrimp.  Keeping me from giving Violet Hour five stars is its strange adherence to it house rules. Get over it...Milk and Honey is the only place worthy of getting away with rules and regulations.
