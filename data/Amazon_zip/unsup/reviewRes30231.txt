Sorry, Sunda, but we are finished. Food is great...but $18 to cut a cake?? How does cutting a cake into 6 slices justify an $18 charge? FUCKING RIDICULOUS! One other time, the busboy did not know what tap water meant. We had to settle for sparkling water and by the end of the meal, more than two-thirds was still left. $8 wasted on nasty sparkling water!
