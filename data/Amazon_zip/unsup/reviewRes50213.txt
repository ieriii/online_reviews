The cure for the common brunch. Big Jones has a creole inspired menu that can simultaneously satisfy your breakfast and lunch craving. The best part is that they take reservations - no more waiting in long lines having not eaten for 14 hours! Food: Melt-in-your-mouth Beignets are brought to the table like dinner rolls. You've got a choice of ordinary brunch food and some interesting creole classics. Get an order of buckwheat banana pancakes for the table! Drink: Full bar - great brunch cocktails. They've got a spicy bloody mary. Ambiance: The joint looks like a high-end southern drawing room. It is always packed, but not hectic. I love it here.
