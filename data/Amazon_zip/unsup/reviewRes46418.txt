What a disappointment this place was! When the hostess asked for my name, I gave my maiden name as it is simpler than my married name. She had the nerve to ask me for an easier name as that was too hard??? We were quoted 35-55 mins for a table. There was no where to sit, we had to stand the whole time we waited. People were sitting on the stair case, the place looked like an upscale Cook County waiting room. The place was so crowded and the door was constantly being opened and it was 20 degrees outside! What made this even worse was the disorganized way people were seated. There were not enough pagers for everyone. The seaters had to come down the escalator, start screaming people's names, go up the escalator screaming it and back down the stairs screaming names. The seaters were loosing the voice and people were not responding. If they had a better system of seating people maybe the wait wouldn't be so bad. After waiting over the wait time, 65 mins later, we were seated. Food was just recycled cheesecake factory menu....I know they are the same company but I expected something a little different. Due to the long wait, which wouldn't have been so bad if it was more comfortable, we just ordered the quickest items, burgers, and got out of there.
