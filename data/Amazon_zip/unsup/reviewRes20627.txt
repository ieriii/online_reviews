Really one of the best sushi experiences I have ever had (even in comparison to way more expensive places). Service and ambience really differentiate this place from others, but the menu was very creative and fresh. Don't exactly recall what we got but I remember the yellowtail being good and the desserts being excellent. Presentation is everything in Japanese cuisine and coast did a very good job of that. BYOB is a big plus, but, again, the service is what sells it for me.
