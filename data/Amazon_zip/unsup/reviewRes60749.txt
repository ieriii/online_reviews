I agree with another reviewer-I love the IDEA of loving Uncommon Ground more so than I actually did. The food was fair and service unattentive. Fresh basil sold me on the special of the day, only to find that it arrived with no basil.  I couldn't get the waitress' attention so I just ate it anyway. I love the atmosphere and event calendar, but not sure if I will return. The bathrooms were unacceptable.
