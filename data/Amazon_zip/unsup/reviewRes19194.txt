The Bad Apple is a great neighborhood find. They have awesome beers on tap and various bottles from all over. Great microbrew selection. I have only had their burgers so I can't speak on the sandwichs however the burgers are juicy, creative, and delicious. I had the belly up with pork belly on a medium rare burger with a pretzle bun. It was excellent. Pork belly was perfectly seared and complimented the burger. Girlfriend had the basic burger which was better than many other burgers in the area. The fries were good. We got them with truffle oil and garlic. I wish they would use truffle salt- it would add so much to the truffle flavor. Garlic fries were very garlicy and if you like the taste of garlicy oil, you will love the garlic fries. I will up my review to 5 stars if they add truffle salt to the fries with truffle oil.
