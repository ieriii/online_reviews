What a fantastic place! I went to Lane Tech h.s. and Hot Doug's is not too far from there. I was introduced to it my freshman year. Doug, the owner, is always in there and he is one of the friendliest and most easy going guys ever. It has a great setting, everything in there is decorated with little hot dog toys and there's pictures of elvis, madonna, and other people. Not to mention that the food is yummy. I've only had the regular hot dogs, which i think are offered for a good deal along with the fries for a good deal. Anyone that i know that knows about that place has never had a bad thing to say about it. I don't go in that area much anymore but I always think about Hot Doug's and how i want to go. I have yet to try some of the game meat which i've heard was amazing. Also, so many times that i've gone there, there has been lines out the door...i dunno but i'd say it's a good sign that all those people are wanting Hot Doug's. The service is quick though, so don't worry about having to wait too long. If you do wait a while though it's pretty damn worth it.
