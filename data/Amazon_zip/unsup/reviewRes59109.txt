I've thought long and hard about what I could complain about and there is nothing! At most, I could say that the wait is long, but good things come to those that wait. I would be suspicious if the wait wasn't long. Actually, the wait wasn't that long, but would have seemed longer if the food sucked!Anyway, my wife and I have been on a breakfast spot search lately and this place was money. A friend recommended but I didn't let my wife know that because last time he recommended a horrible place. I'm all for second chances though and a good thing too.I had a countryside skillet. It was meatastic. They didn't have to put the country gravy on the side, but thank god that they did. My wife had the peach cobbler crepe.  It was like having desert for breakfast and who doesn't like desert?! You need to know what you are getting into before you order it though. My wife says that it was TOO much food. We did have the orange-strawberry juice and it was good enough to smack yo' momma! While the word "yolk" sounds disgusting when you think about it, this resteraunt makes the word sound delicious once you have been there. Yolk is hot like fire!
