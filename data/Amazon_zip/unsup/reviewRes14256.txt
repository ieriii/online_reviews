I've been to Revolution probably a dozen times now, and it never disappoints. It might have wrestled the title of favorite brewpub away from Goose Island for me. Why? Surprisingly, its not the beer, but rather the food! Their menu is bold and hearty, just like their beers. From the smoky chicken wings (with amazing blue cheese potatoes), to the chorizo pizza, to the various burgers their flavors are big, unapologetically spicy and in your face. I've eaten there probably 8 or 10 times and have yet to have a bad meal there. As for the beers, well, they are capable craftsman, offering beers with personality, distinctive character, with many exhibiting obvious hop character. There's always a pretty good range to choose from, including Belgian styles, some nice takes on Stouts and Porters, and many of the kind of pale ales and IPA's you'd expect from a brew pub. They also have guest draughts that round out their own offerings quite nicely. I typically sit at the bar, where service is OK. Most of the bartenders are very low key, which is great, but some maybe to the point where a few might come off as uninterested. Generally wait staff folks are competent and usually pretty responsive. The third part of the experience at Revolution is the atmosphere and interior. Really well designed, artfully decorated with some very unique and custom details. The fist sculptural elements that support the upper bar are beautifully carved, and really drive home the theme that revolution is trying to put across - bold, unapologetic, in your face beer and food! Its got everything going for it, and the crowds on evenings and weekends tends to support that. If your looking for a quieter, low key experience, weekday lunchtime is much less crowded -- for now. For all these reasons, Revolution gets a rare 4 star rating from me. Viva la revolucion!
