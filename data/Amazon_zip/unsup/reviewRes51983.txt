Gino's East serves authentic Chicago style deep dish pizza. I have had deep dish pizza like this before at Zachary's in Berkeley, CA....truth be told it tasted very similar. Zachary's pretty much ripped off Gino's and other Chicago pizzeria's style....but you know what? It's my favorite type of pizza. I do like thin crust as well, but something about those large slices with the the tomatoes on top and the cheese below it make it my fav.  There was a long line to get in the place, but I was playing tourist and was on one of those double-decker buses and I noticed on the inside to "present this map to get priority seating at Gino's East"....so I essentially cut the 30 minute line at the front, because I took time to read through the map - bonus points for me. It takes about 45 minutes for a pie, but at least you know everything is fresh. We got a small classic sausage and it was enough for 2, excellent corn meal crust, fresh tomatoes, excellent cheese - great stuff. There are probably others around Chicago that are just as good or better with less of a wait, but this was excellent pizza in a prime location.
