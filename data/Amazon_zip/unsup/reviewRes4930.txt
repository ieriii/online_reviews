Purple Pig was easily one of the most memorable meals I had while in Chicago on my most recent 4 day trip. My friend and I were lucky enough to get a seat at the bar as soon as we got there, at 10pm. Our waiter, Lucasz, was really, really funny. He was informative too, but clearly really chill and knowing his stuff. He recommended an awesome wine for us after we said we both liked Malbecs. Furthermore, he helped us pick three distinctive cheese, all three of which were pretty unique and worth finishing to the last crumb. PP served up one of the best beet salads I've ever had. Another dish worth trying was the Wagyu Sirloin Tip with Fingerling Potatoes Red Onions, Olive and Bone Marrow Vinaigrette. It's a bit loud, and I hear it's terribly hard to get a table, but if you have the time, it's definitely worth a bite.
