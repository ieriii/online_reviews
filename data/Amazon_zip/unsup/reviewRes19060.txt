It's always nice to think back on a dining experience and then realize you love every single thing you ate. Let's start with round 1: Poutine! I've never had it before so I don't have a lot to compare it to but I really enjoyed this dish. Mmmmmm Round 2: Onion Soup. The server brought us bowls with the dry ingredients and then poured in the broth at the table. This was so damn good. The broth was rich with flavor yet still light.  Round 3: Scallops. Cooked perfectly with lovely side greens.  Drinks: dirty martini's and wine....all good but not cheap but no surprise there. I also really enjoyed the ambiance of this place. It is very big but still warm. They do a great job with lighting and a pleasing comforting color scheme.
