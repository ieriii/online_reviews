So yummy for brunch on a lazy weekend day - with the weather turning nice, you and your pooch can grab a table outside.... we had a bit of a wait the Sunday we went, but it was expected and not outrageous. Coffee is really good, We had a bit of everything from the menu - the french toast looked awesome, and I can vouch for the huevos rancheros - del-ish. I got mini cupcakes for the table and a nice way to finish off a very nice lazy Sunday. Looking forward to another trip back soon
