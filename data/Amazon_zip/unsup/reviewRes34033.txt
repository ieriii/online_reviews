Sultan's has become a staple in my life ever since my first experience about 2 years ago. Without a doubt, hands down, the best falafel sando you will ever eat in your life. It is perfect! The falafel is always perfectly crunchy and delicious. For $4, you can't go wrong. I've tried a few things from the deli and they were all great. They have a great selection of different drinks but the falafel is best washed down (as is everything else) with an Ice Cold Coca-Cola Classic. Sultan's is one of the only places I have no problem with eating at straight several days in a row. It's also one of the only places I don't like to go more than two weeks without eating. Thank you Sultan's.
