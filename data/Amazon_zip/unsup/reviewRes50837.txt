Since there's no Dixie Kitchen in Lakeview, it's nice to have a second runner up in the form of Wishbone. They are obviously very popular for brunch. Who wouldn't want a southern-inspired meal to wake up the weekend? I had the blackened catfish served up with some cheesy grits and scrambled eggs and it was delectable. I also really enjoyed their dinner. The chicken and mango salsa is pretty good, but I was most impressed by the rutabaga turnip mash. I had not had rutabagas that good since my grandmother last cooked some. Seriously, how many Chicago restaurants can you name that serve rutabaga? Enough said. Wishbone rules!
