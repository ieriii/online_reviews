Went for the fixed price menu. After a couple of great martinis I had the scallops and ribeye and my date had soup and salmon. I would be more specific but I was in the moment. I look for value and got it even with the hefty price. It helps if youre nice with the wait staff but dont let them take over, have fun. Then theyre attentive without the pretentiousness. I will dream of this meal, loved the service. Won't be back soon only because its not a meal I can regularly afford.
