I stayed at La Quinta last night after a long day in the city. Upon arrival they couldn't find our reservation and didn't quite treat it well. In the end, they did find the reservation and were apologetic. Alls well that ends well. Our room was on the 9th floor and a smoking room (gross) but the hotel was sold out and the smell only lingered a little bit. The room was beautiful~this isn't your usual La Quinta. It was quite large and spacious with two double beds. The bathroom was also very nice with a see-thru shower...OooLaLa. I liked the shade covering the window (see picture)...it made the room seem a bit chic. Tons of cable channels, nice working coffee maker (since some people noted it not working). Free breakfast from 7-10am. The parking lot next door is crazy expensive so I suggest parking in the Green City Parking lot but you'll have to be out by 7am which will mean no soup for you!
