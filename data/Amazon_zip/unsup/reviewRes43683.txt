I little bit steep on the price considering the quality of their steaks. The dry-aged delmonico (rib eye steak) was decent. The dry-aged KansasCity (bone-in strip steak) was disappointing. The shrimp cocktail appetizer tasted like one of those ready platters from dominicks. By no means is this place a bad steakhouse, but with the price in consideration, you could do better.
