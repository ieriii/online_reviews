I was excited to finally try this place! My friends and I ordered a pitcher of Half Acre and a large pepperoni pan pizza. The carmalized crust was a nice addition and the sauce was ok, nothing outstanding, but it was good. I read a few reviews that mention deep dish, which Pequod's does not have. They served pan pizza which is a bit different, so maybe that is why some people are disappointed. Only a few places in Chicago serve true deep dish. http://en.wikipedia.org/
