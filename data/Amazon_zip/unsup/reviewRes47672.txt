Zed was a last minute thought, we were craving beef. We called ahead to make a reservation and they said just walk in, which makes me a bit nervous. However, they did tell us we could bring our own wine in, which is quite nice ($15 corkage.) Note...we did buy a bottle of white for the fabulous salad selections. Now I am not the biggest fan of the Brazilian style steakhouses, but I live a couple of blocks away from Zed and Fogo, so we have been to Fogo and now we had to try Zed. What a difference of food quality. The servers/chefs were so much more personable and knowledgeable. Overall, the experience was great and the price is more then fair. We had a great experience. One slightly negative note, our front server (tall blonde guy) was a bit pretentious about his own food and wine knowledge, which was not that impressive. He actually talked to the table slowly as if we were children trying to educate us. We told him after the second encounter that all three of us were in the f&b biz, but he went on to talk to us like we did not know anything. Other then that, everything and everyone from the bussers to the managers were great.
