After my trip to Charleston and falling in love with Southern Fare I was so excited to see this place open so I could get my hands on some fried green tomatoes. Thats what I love about the Chi, lots of different and exciting food options.  I loved the food, the sweet tea pork chops were good, the fried Chicken salad is incredible, never had more tender delicious chicken and the dressing is to die for. The problem is they just dont have their act together yet. They were out of menus and we waited for 10 minutes just for that. They were out of 2 dishes and the beer we tried to order. Server was nice but slow. I will totally go back and recommend it to anyone, just know that they are still working out some kinks. Next time I hope its better and Ill revise my rating, because its some good grub!
