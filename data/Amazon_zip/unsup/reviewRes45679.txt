I had my Birthday dinner here last weekend. They were super friendly and my table was ready when I got there and I was early. They didnt mind holding the table for a little bit after 7 since I was waiting for the rest of at least some of the people to get there. The waitress was super nice. I ordered a burger sans bun with sweet potato fries so nothing too out of the ordinary. Everything was good and there was a goat cheese dipping sauce for the sweet potato fries that was pretty good as well.
