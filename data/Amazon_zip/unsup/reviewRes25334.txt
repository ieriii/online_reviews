Simply the best restaurant I've been to in years. I arrived with a large party and was a bit hesitant due to the hype...but Mercat did not disappoint.  We were slightly overwhelmed by the menu - so many options, so little time. Besides, we were there to engage in good conversation (that's what it's about, right?). We all decided to go with the chef's choice, which varies on a daily basis. it's a three course smorgasbord of culinary delight. I can't even remember every item we had, but some of the highlights were the salad wrapped in prosciutto, bacon wrapped dates, the rack of lamb and beef tenderloin. Simply amazing. We were a bit worried by "tapas" yet we left more than full. Our server was more than friendly and accommodated our every need (alternate choices for a non-seafood eating friend). The bartender was really nice and actually stopped by our table during dinner, just to see how we were doing. (Who does that?)  I was quite impressed with the ambiance as well. The Renaissance (owned by Marriott) did a fantastic job restoring the hotel, as they do with almost every property they own. The energy was high and the staff remained pretty calm. It was crowded but we managed to feel like we had our own area and the rest of the dining room didn't bother us.  As mentioned, the chef's choice was a prix fixe deal at $65 per person (or just around there). Sangria was flowing as well. Overall, it ended up being just over $100 per person, tip included - not too bad for the myriad of flavors and tasty dishes served throughout the evening. I'm bringing out-of-towners here every chance I get!
