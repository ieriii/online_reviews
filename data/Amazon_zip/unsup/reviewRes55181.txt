This place had great food, amazing service, and was overall the perfect place for my BBQ-loving husband's birthday. A lot of people have commented about the price of the food. While this place is priced higher than many BBQ places, you also will never find the kind of service that Chicago Q offers at any of those places. (I also doubt you could find flights of single barrel whiskeys at any other BBQ place--a huge hit with my husband and I). This place is definitely worth checking out.
