Two ladies after work looking for a place to chat, drink and of course eat.... My friend and I went straight to Hopleaf on a Monday after work. I had never been before and she had. We sat on the beautiful back patio surrounded by all the plants they were growing. Our table was right next to the tomato garden. Going GreeN! Sooooo many beers! So many of my top favorites. We started with their specialty, mussels. MMMMMMmmm they were delicious! By the end we were stacking our shells like Jenga pieces. And the fries that come with the mussels were so good. They came with a garlic aioli for dipping... Sorry, I'm back. Then we each got a side house salad that was really fresh and had a great house vinaigrette. We also shared the mac 'n cheese and the squash blossoms. The mac 'n cheese was baked in a white cheese that escapes me right now.. but oh man was it good. The squash blossoms were very interesting because it's amazing to think how they came up with the combination of flavors. They were squash blossoms stuffed with lobster, corn and cream cheese then beer battered and fried and they were served with a lobster bisque dipping sauce. Talk about a party in your mouth! Then we tried (I know) the chocolate power bar thing for dessert. It was a chocolate crunchy, crispy bar with chocolate mousse and whipped cream. Then chocolate and a creamy peanut butter/caramel substance was on the plate with hazel nuts for accessorizing. Bravo Hopleaf!
