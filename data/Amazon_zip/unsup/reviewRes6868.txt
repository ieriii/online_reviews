Went there yesterday to celebrate early Valentine's Day. The waitstaff is fantastic, the ambiance is perfect, but most importantly the food is just amazing. The resturant itself is small and intimate, with exposed brick and small tables with white cloth over them. Definetly a spot for a date. We order the Monday special and we had: Calamari Grilled, Cesar Salad it was crisp and fresh,Risotto Pescatore ,Spaghetti allo Scoglio , Lobster ravioli and to end the night with a bread pudding. Overall a great place :)
