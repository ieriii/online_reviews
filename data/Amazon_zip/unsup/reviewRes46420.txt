Offering a slightly more sophisticated menu of items than its relative the Cheesecake Factory, Grand Lux lives up to the same fantastic standards. Spectacular decor, great service, and the same presentation and portion size you would see at Cheesecake. The variety of food covers everything from Asian style to Mexican so you can always try something new, making it appropriate from Sunday brunch with friends to a semi casual dinner date.  The one downfall is the high probability of a wait, so plan accordingly, but also know that Michigan Ave. just out the door, so take a stroll!
