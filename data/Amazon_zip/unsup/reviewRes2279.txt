I don't think this is as good as Pink's hot dog in LA. However, I'd give this place 2 thumbs up though. Great place, good food, creative menu, great friendly service. I wish I had a chance to try their duck fat fries. We went on a weekday and they only serve that on weekends. I think they're just discriminating toward Asians who travel on weekdays :) j/k
