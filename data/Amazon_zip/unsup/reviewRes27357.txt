Rick Bayless' "less fancy" side of the Frontera Grill & Topolobampo. I've been there several times and every time its been nothing less than amazing. The margaritas are perfect, the only problem with the guac is you'll want more, and the ceviche trio are super fresh and delicious. You need to make reservations well in advance to get a table in the restaurant on the weekend. Otherwise you can show up and wait in line outside before it opens to get on the waitlist. Sometimes you can get lucky and find a spot at the bar where they serve the entire menu. All in all, it definitely lives up to the hype, and isn't even terribly expensive for the high quality of food.
