I was in the area, so I remember reading a friend's review on this place and decided to dine here for lunch.In one word: AMAZING.For just $22, I decided to go for the three course meal featuring your choice of salad, an entree, and dessert.First, warm bread arrived freshed from the oven, and the butter that accompanied it was very tasty. The bread was delicious.My first course was the Caesar Salad with fresh shaved parmesan cheese. It was a great and satisfying salad. Definitely a great recipe and dressing.The second course is why I came to a steak house in the first place: I was served a 6 oz petit filet, and my waiter kindly reminded me that the dish was a boiling 500 degrees. The second course came with a heaping portion of mashed potatos, and at this point, I way definitely full.But I saved room for dessert. The third course featured a sample platter of two desserts: carrot cake and chocolate mousse. I had made home made chocolate mousse a few weeks earlier, and I would say it was the same level of quality. Very delicious. What was surprising was the mousse came in this chocolate bowl that they you could also eat!!! The carrot cake was also appetizing and refreshing.The service was quite good too. Water service was prompt, and my waiter was pretty friendly.
