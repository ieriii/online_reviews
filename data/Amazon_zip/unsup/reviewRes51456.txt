So I don't really like to go into the Lincoln Square area since parking is hard to find. Garcia's is the exception to that rule. A tad more upscale Mexican Cuisine and newly renovated. The ceiling are decorated with colorful stenciled out colorful sheets of paper. We were seated almost immediately and our waiter was very attentive. Our group ordered and shared the : Enchiladas in Verde sauce, Steak nachos, steak burrito, and steak tacos. What can I say...we like steak in ALL of its beautiful forms. The meat was chunky and beautifully cooked. Its cool because they bring out this barrage of sauces: One a tomato salsa which isn't spicy at all. A bright green jalapeno puree (so it seems). And a Tomatillo sauce which i love to mix with the jalapeno sauce. We had a margarita which was super sized and loaded with Delicious tequila. My only wish is that they have more selections for taco/torta/gordita....maybe a chicaronnes verdes? I am impressed that they have a full bar and excellent service. I love thier drinks and wouldn't mind spending those few extra dollars for good service and the ambiance. I can't wait to return and try something totally different on thier menu.
