Great food, great ambiance and great people watching.... I love the Duck hash salad and the rock shrimp appetizer. All of the food was great, from the sushi to the hot entrees, nothing disappointed me. The waitstaff were attentive and checked up on us in a timely manner. I does get VERY busy, so you definitely will need a reservation for a Friday or Saturday night, and its a great place to dine before heading out. The bar is a great place to hang while waiting for your table. It can get loud, so if your looking for a quiet place for dinner, pick a time early in the evening for your reservation and you shouldn't have a problem. I will definitely be coming back.
