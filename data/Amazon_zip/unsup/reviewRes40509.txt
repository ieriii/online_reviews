For a casual whiskey bar, the food does not get any better. This place is just fun for friends or a date. The food is not mainstream, it is rich but very well done. Eclectic, local ambiance is fun, cocktails are great, and food exceeds expectations. Deep fat fries, pork belly, frog legs, bone marrow, truffles, who would expect this from a whiskey bar? Always a good time.
