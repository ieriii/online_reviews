Fresh off the tarmac from O'Hare - this was our first stop. The entrance is set back on Michigan Ave (almost missed it) so look out for the big purple awning. We had lunch on a recent Monday. I was surprised by the crowd. You walk through a heated, enclosed outdoor seating area to enter (it was rowdy with colleagues by 12:30). Since we were tourists, we sat inside at a high-top communal table near the bar. We received excellent service including constantly replenished water glasses. It's the little things. Delicious small plates that we kept ordering repeats of...some of my favorites were: scallops with chickpea aioli, beet salad with goat cheese and the whipped feta with cucumber smear - light and refreshing. If you're going to spend any amount of time in this part of Chicago (it's in the center of it all), you must check out the Pig.
