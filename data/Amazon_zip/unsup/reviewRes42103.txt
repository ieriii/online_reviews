Dear Tank, So far you are the only pho place in Chicago that I've gone back to, and I love you for that. Your sandwiches are only so-so compared to Nhu Lan, but your pho is usually tasty and (so far) not funky. However, why are you so randomly closed on Wednesdays, and why do I always forget and make plans to go out and then have to settle for some other pho place I'm inevitably going to be dissatisfied with? I hope someday to find that pho place in Chicago that will really blow me away with its quality, but until then, Dear Tank, I'm yours.
