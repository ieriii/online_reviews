Went on a Tuesday night (can't go wrong with 1/2 off burgers), the 30-minute wait to be seated and 40-minute to get our food was absolutely worth it. I ordered the "Cruelty to Animals" burgers which has has carnitas, bacon, prosciutto, and white cheddar...and I added quail egg....and it was...it was just so good. Great atmosphere and awesome fries!
