i am totally surprised to say that I LOVED IT! I have not been to Carnivale since 2007 - and the food and drinks were great at that time. I was somewhat shocked to find that they still are! I'm a fan of the decor and the drinks. The bartender really knows how to deliver a capirinha with force. The food was really tasty and while we all had steaks, I don't recall the detail of each item. Just that they were really good.
