We went there for lunch today. The entrance of the restaurant was hard to find, I think it's a place for the locals. At least I appreciate the fact that we do not need to wait to be seated. I think they do have one of the best lobster sandwich I've ever had in the US. The sandwich is $18, little pricey but quite worth it. The ingredients are fresh and very delicious. We also got their signature club but that was alright. Their fresh juice goes well with the sandwich. I'd definitely like to go back again and try different things on the menu! :)
