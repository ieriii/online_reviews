I ate over at the Kinzie Chophouse back in the summer. I was lead to my table by a friendly hostess, through the cozy little steakhouse with decor reminiscent of a southern steamboat. The ambiance was very welcoming, with warm golden tones, candlelight, dark wood decor, and leather seating. Since it was the Friday before Labor Day weekend, the restaurant was not very crowded, as expected, and so I was tended to immediately. My server was very polite and provided me with extra information not listed on the menu, and allowed me to take as much time as I needed to decide what I wanted to order. I ended up choosing the chicken breast parmesan. It was phenomenal - a generous-sized breast, topped with melted parmesan cheese, and spaghetti marinara on the side. Throughout the meal, my beverage was topped off promptly, and my waiter was attentive without hovering. The manager also came by in the middle of my meal to ask how everything was. Overall, it was a pleasant dining experience. My only complaints were that even though the restaurant was more than half empty, I got seated in the back against the wall, while I noticed there were plenty of small tables along the window. I did end up feeling a bit cast aside. Also, while I am all for the upscale vibe of downtown restaurants and polite, refined servers, I observed that some of the other servers were taking that image a little too far. I am fairly certain that the server tending to the tables surrounding my own was faking his posh accent. My fellow diners were also out-of-towners wearing cowboy hats, attempting to be witty and charming. This only made the experience more comical for me than perhaps it should have been. I plan to visit the chophouse again, and give it another try.
