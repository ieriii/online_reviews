Let me preface my review by saying there are clearly already numerous renderings for Spacca Napoli here. Since there isn't much (or anything) unprecedented I can add to the collection let's just roll list style, shall we? I'll save my long-windedness for the next one. Spacca Napoli (+) ---------------------------- - It was quite easy to get a last minute reservation for a Thursday night on the patio - Eating al fresco on the verge of Fall among candlelight and neighborhood folk was nice - Friendly, attentive service and my water was filled every time I took a sip. Love via tap water, nice! - Melon and Prosciutto special appetizer; insane portion, delicious, perfect combo of sweet and salty - Insalata Mista; somewhat plain with only lettuces, olives, tomato and some balsamic, however, the freshness and simplicity was appreciated. And again with those portions, 1 salad is easily enough for 4 to share. - Naples-style Pizza. Yum. Yum. Yum. In. My. Tum. Tum. Tum. The margherita (classically done with mozzarella, tomatoes and basil) and funghi e salsiccia (mushrooms, fennel, sausage) pizzas were outstanding!! This is what it's all about, chewy, tangy, fresh and piping hot straight from the oven. - Zabaglione dessert. Served in a juice cup (cute!) it was tasty, creamy and the perfect sweet to accompany after-dinner espresso and good conversation.  Spacca Napoli ( - ) ---------------------------- - While sitting outside is nice, being jarred by the adjacent Montrose brown line is not. I may opt for inside seating next time. - The pizzas need to be watched extremely carefully as Napoli style pizza cooks lightening fast. Burnt edges become inedible and you're left with crust castoffs. The crust is my favorite part, a 1/4 section ruined by char on one pizza was a bit of a bummer. - Baked ricotta dessert. Way too dry. Like week-old cheesecake... we drowned it in zabaglione to make it edible.
