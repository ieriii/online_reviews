Maybe I am lucky and my first visit to restaurants end up wildly successful. Apparently, it happened again.  The wife and I decided to celebrate our first anniversary by trying out Mercat. We weren't sure what we were going to do so we just threw caution to the wind and did the Chef's tasting menu with wine pairings. At $85 per person, it's not cheap, but this was a special occasion so we went for it. Holy jeez. This was the steal of a lifetime! 12 bountiful courses with 3 different wines. We honestly expected 12 amuse-bouche courses. Instead, the portions were large and delicious! But let me take a step back... When making the reservations, I mentioned that it was our anniversary. Our waitress (who was beyond awesome) brought us complimentary cava and what could be described as Spanish bruschetta. Both were absolutely perfect. The flavors matched perfectly.  I'll preface the description of the meal by saying that I don't recall the names of the wines that were paired. What I can say is that they matched perfectly with the food, melding one course with another.  As for the food, we had the following dishes: cadi urgelia, serrano ham & fig salad, some sort of Gazpacho with salmon roe and pork belly, truita de patata con espinacas, croquetas de bacalao, datiles con almendras, gambas al ajillo, costillas de ternera, conill amb chestnut, coles de bruselas (with lentils, I think), imperial wagyu short ribs and diver scallops.  Again, everything was well sized and delicious. By the end of the meal, I asked the waitress if we were finally done since my stomach didn't have any additional room. This must be a common question because she brought out soda water with bitters and said that it would make us feel much better and less full. Guess what...It worked!!! I'm putting that down as a trick from now on!  Honestly, the whole experience we had was above and beyond. It's not a cheap date but I think we got every penny's worth.  I would absolutely recommend Mercat to others.
