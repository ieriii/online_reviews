I went here on a Friday night and I loved this restaurant. We didn't have reservations but we didn't wait ling before we were sat out on the patio with a nice breeze coming in. I was a bit skeptical when I looked over the menu some of the things I couldn't pronounce. I love chicken so I can usually be safe with that. It was delicious and very moist. I am not a fan of guacamole but I was hungry while waiting for my meal. It was the THE BEST Ive had. It was very chunky and De-Lish-Us! The drinks are well made and very strong! I had a Victoria's Secret.....yummy. After a glass and a half I almost stumbled out of the place. I would definitely return.
