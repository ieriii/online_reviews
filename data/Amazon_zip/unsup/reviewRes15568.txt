This place has a ridiculously pretentious vibe. But it works. I thought the whole feel of the place made the experience, and I thoroughly enjoyed my three (yes, three, don't judge me) cocktails. All of the staff was able to recommend something, and were knowledgeable about each drink. You might have to wait, which adds to the pretension, while reading " the rules" (which are hilarious) and while standing in a dark hallway where you can't see anything. A do-not-miss for the Chicago area traveler.
