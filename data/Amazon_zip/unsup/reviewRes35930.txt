Return visit to Sun Wah, this time with 7 friends. Two Peking Ducks complete with all the fixings and a lot of other dishes to sample around the menu including the amazing Mike's Chicken, Broccoli with house cured bacon and more. The Duck was as stellar as always, and each other dish was a pleasure - well made, generous portions. I'm surprised to see negative comments about service since I've always found the service warm and helpful. Our water glasses were never empty, the wait staff made sure we were always happy and had everything we might possibly need - and the manager Kelly went out of her way to make sure we had a great experience. Final treat of the night was the peach sorbet - house made - with lovely herbal tones as well. Can't wait to go back ... again and again. We came home with leftovers enough for another full meal for the 8 of us and the check was only $30 each including a very good tip for the great time the Sun Wah team made sure we had.
