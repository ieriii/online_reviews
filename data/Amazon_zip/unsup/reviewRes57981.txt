Overrated.However, I will start with the positives...- Very nice, friendly wait staff and busboys. Prompt and helpful without being overbearing.- Great gelati! Pleasantly surprised. Truthfully, I just wanted something cold in the heat (we'll get to that in a second), and it shocked me with the subtle and memorable flavor!- The bread is good.But, the negatives outweighed the positives...- Hot as h-e-double-hockey-sticks in there. It's called air conditioning - use it. - I felt crammed in like a sardine. Look, if I wanted to be on a date with the sweathog @ the next table (he was affected by the temp too), I'd ask him out. I'm not asking for a private room...all I want is to be able to feel like I could move my arms without checking to see if I elbowed said sweathog.- Appetizers & entrees were painfully subpar and, thus, overpriced. I felt like there was either too much on a plate (trying to cover up the mediocrity) or the dish wasn't thought through (like it was missing something). I was thoroughly disappointed. There are so many other Chicago Italian restaurants that are tastier, a complete meal, and worth the money. Buck up, Mia Francesca.
