Nice restaurant with a good variety of pizza slices(stuffed, pan and thin crusts). Usually have around a dozen different pizz'a to choose from, or you can order to your own taste. There is also a full menu of other Italian/American dishes available. I go for a slice of thin cheese, and a slice of pan sausage, which is more than enough to fill anyone up. The crust has a healthy dose of olive oil, a big fan of this!!!
