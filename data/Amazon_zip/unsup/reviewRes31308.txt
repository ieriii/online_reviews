After all the hype, I had to go and try it out for myself. When you walk in, you immediately notice the Asian fusion vibe and you think to yourself, 'Is this going to be another PF Chang's?' The answer is NO!!! This place is upscale and very hipster. We went to dinner early to beat the rush and thankfully we did. Around 7-8pm the place seems to go from restaurant to drinking lounge. Which was fine for me, but others might not feel the same. The sushi was absolutely delicious!!! We ordered the firecracker roll and finished it so fast that we needed to have another!!! I'm no sushi connoisseur but in my opinion, this was by far the best sushi roll I've had in a long time. The only thing that's preventing me from giving it 5 stars is the fact that the steak I ordered came back dry and burnt. If you're looking for a place to grab some upscale sushi, this is definitely the place to be.
