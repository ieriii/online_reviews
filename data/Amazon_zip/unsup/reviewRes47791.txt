What a great place!!! Going there, we didnt realize it was a brazilian steakhouse, probably would not have gone knowing that, but I am glad we did... it was a great place, not only for the delicious food, but also the great people watching. Very trendy / upscale crowd... esp. if going to the patio on the rooftop, beautiful views and great setup... lounge in the rest. was nice as well.  The restuarant itself was beautiful!!! Bambo and wood floors and decor, just perfect, who knew this was started in the burbs, it looked unique and just perfect for the city. The experience was great as well, there are "Harvest " tables set up in the center of the dining area, where you can help yourself as often as you want, to amazing gourmet appetizers, salads, cheese/meats, etc. Each App comes with a special sauce...very tasty... didnt try too many of the actual meats, cause I enjoyed the harvest table so much, but the pieces I did try were cooked and seasoned well ... go hungry!!! The price is $49 dollars a person, but its worth it, esp for a special occasion.  The service was also wonderful, our waiter was great and prompt, very laidback.... hostesses were very nice and explained the process well, at the end of the night the chef was by the door and thanked us for dining there, everyone was great.... My top pic for the month!! Great Experience.
