I would have given this place 5 stars....but the service was just not there. The decor in the restaurant is really nice, very modern though. Also, lots of people at the bar area, probably there for happy hour. So here's my experience, let's start! We made reservations and were seated quite quickly, given we came on a weekday. Then, our waiter took FOREVER to greet us. After 10 minutes, he came and gave us the skinny on their setup, then said he'll be back to get our drink orders. After 20 minutes, he decides to show up and get our drink orders, and another 10 minutes to get our drinks (I had the blueberry mojito and it was DELISH!). So then we headed over to the salad bar and they had awesome gourmet selections, from simple grilled vegetables to mushrooms with goat cheese dressing! Simply amazing :) After we enjoyed the salads..we hastily put our stones in the middle to indicate that we are ready for some meats! Well, we waited for probably 10-15 minutes before a chef noticed that we were waiting for entrees. And after we had finished our 1 slice of meat, we waited another 15 minutes before another chef came....and this happened all throughout dinner = VERY LOOOONG dinner, longer than it should have been! As far as the actual entrees, they all were VERY good and they had stuff you wouldn't normally see at your regular Brazilian steakhouse, such as lamb, goat, and venison that were cooked to perfection! Also, the seared tuna with seaweed salad and wasabi mayo was amazing, we asked for it twice (but it took 30 mins for it to come..booo) Dessert was amazing, we had the mango creme brulee, bread pudding, and banana creme pie and all were amazingly tasty and delicious! But, again...our waiter gave us our menu and didn't come back until 15 minutes later to get our order.... So in recap: Food is gourmet and AMAZING but the service is SLOW....so if you're planning on dinner here....ensure you have no plans afterwards :)
