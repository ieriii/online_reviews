Adorable little take out place with YUMMY cuban food. Delicious. Had the Tofu dinner which was two tofu slices simmered in delectable tomato sauce with onion and red and green pepper wedges. Accompanied by white rice, a cup of black beans and delicious sweet plantains. Significant other had the pollo dinner which was two delicious chicken tenderloins covered in onions, with the same cup of black beans, white rice, and delicious sweet plaintains. We washed it down with one of the yerba mate soda cans, but there's also tropical milkshakes and other sodas -- don't miss the cuban coffee if you're into a hard cup of strong but sweetened coffee. A new favorite! Very little seating inside, but they do have some chairs and tables outside. Best known as a takeout place. Great service, friendly staff/owners. A must try!
