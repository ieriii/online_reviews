It was fine, but I wasn't wowed.  There were not very many tables for four... our choices at a 6:30 reservation were either right next to the wait station (silverware, etc) or out in the sun room by the windows. Fortunately my friend took the seat by the window as it was too cold for me. I also didn't love the patio-type furniture in that part of the restaurant. We started with the mushroom pizza. It was fine, but nothing special..  Then we had salads.... I had the beet salad, which was delicious. They delivered two of the salads wrong... accidentally switched my husband's with my friend's.  Hmmm... if you're not sure, ask? They each ate a few bites before they realized and traded back. For entrees, we had the veal chop special (well-liked but quite pricey), the boar ragu (fine, but boar ragu is usually more amazing), the tortolloni with chestnuts and browned butter (fine) and the tuna (really tasty and rare as requested, but I asked if there were peppers... was told there were not ... and there WERE!). So... all in all, I don't think I will hurry back.
