This place is great! It is very bustling and busy and loud inside, but we actually only waited 20 minutes to get seated outside on a beautiful Friday night. The service was excellent despite the fact they were understaffed as the earlier storms of the day portended a bad night for sitting outside. Try lots of stuff! Most of it is really good. We had: Tuna with lima beans - deliciously vinegary Roasted beets with goat cheese and pistachios - incredibly wonderful despite how random it sounds - beets, and um goat cheese and how bout we throw some pistachios in there - but they were wonderful Sardines with fennel salad - I'm not a sardine fan but my friends loved it, ditto for the Bone Marrow plate Scallops with chick pea aoli Arancini - lovely rice balls with minty stuff inside Fried proscuitto bread balls - just ok Pork with mashed potatoes - home cooking at its best
