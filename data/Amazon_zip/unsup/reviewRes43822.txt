I came here this past Monday with my brother for lunch and I can say the only thing that impressed me was the burger, somewhat. We were seated before the table next to us and yet that table was asked for their drink order first, by two separate waiters! We had to finally flag a waiter down to get our drinks. We placed our food order the same time we asked for our drinks because the prior incident was taken as an indicator of the service. Sure enough, our burgers came about 25 minutes later. Now, I would be somewhat understanding of the long wait if the place was packed wall to wall but this was not the case that Monday. Also, c'mon - it was a burger! The burger was good, but not overly impressive. I am glad burgers is what we ordered for lunch because it would have been a greater disappointment if we had spent more money. Having said all of the above, my brother's office is on the other side of the river and he frequents the establishment quite a bit with coworkers and clients. He said the poor service was a first for him. He is loyal so he will be back. I on the other hand, am not so forgiving so i will opt for lunch somewhere else when work brings me to the Merchandise mart or surrounding area.
