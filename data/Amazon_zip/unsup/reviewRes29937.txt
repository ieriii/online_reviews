Recently had a great experience at Opart Thai (on Western) with a group of 20+ for lunch. We were seated comfortably in the back area, and the walls gave us a semi-private setting. Very impressed with how well the small wait staff handled such a large group with excellent service. Onto the cuisine: Shu Mai (shrimp dumplings) - Appetizer Plate included a sampling of spring rolls, crab rangoon, and my new favorite Shu Mai which I particulary enjoyed. All the appetizers were fried without tasting greasy. Green Curry Chicken (Gaeng Keow Waan) - Standard fare, but medium spicy was perfectly hot without being too hot. Dessert - Save room for dessert, totally worth it! Both the Fried Banana and Thai Custard were excellent. Fried Banana is a spring roll filled with banana creamed with coconut which makes for a nice contrast to the crunchy spring roll shell. Thai Custard is almost a dense cake, and served piping hot (eater beware!). Overall, adding the pleasant ambience of the restaurant to the great food and service comes up with a full four-star rating.
