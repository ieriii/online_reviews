My husband and I were pleasantly surprised with this restaurant. The address is a Western address, so we thought we were going to a quick hole in the wall place. When we walked in, this place is huge. We didn't realize there was an entrance on Lincoln and cute windows/doors that are open if weather pemits! The food was good, the queso fundido w/ chorizo was amazing!!! The skirt steak fajitas weren't the best steak fajitas I've ever had, but they were good.
