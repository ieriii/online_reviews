I have been here a couple of times for dinner. Both times we had reservations which I believed helped us get in right away. The food is pretty good. We had the empanadas and octopus for appetizers which were good. I think all of us had some type of steak combo dish which also was very good. I would definitely go back to this restaurant. They also have good sangria.
