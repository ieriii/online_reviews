My cousin wanted to treat me to dinner for my birthday. I happily hopped on Yelp to sift through the multitude of restaurants I have yet to try. But then I remembered that Anteprima is right up the street and absolutely wonderful. First off, make a reservation. Second, get the octopus appetizer because it will rock your socks off. Third, anything pasta is a winner. Our server coursed our meal, so everything came out already separated for two. The mushroom ravioli was so savory and rich. At first when I saw the bowl of just four squares I was like "really?", but there's no way I could have eaten anymore. The trout was cooked to perfection, nicely seasoned and wonderfully crispy. I know I should have gotten the lemon panna cotta, but we opted for the chocolate and hazelnut dessert and weren't disappointed. Anteprima is a gem.
