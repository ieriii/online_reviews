Stopped in here for a late dinner on a hot pre-summer evening. Since I am not from Chicago, I am uncertain if an unexpected heatwave hit the city, but Bin 36 was obviously not prepared for the weather. This restaurant was HOT. Not cool when you are a wine store and supposed to keep wine below 70 degrees. Not to mention I had to take off my sweater and wear a very casual t-shirt, and my husband was sweating. We ordered a cheese plate and the soft goat cheese was completely melted on the plate! Otherwise, we thought both the food and wine (which was not served at the proper temperature- big surprise there) were both OKAY. Hubby ordered the burger special only because he didn't want to drop any extra money on his entree. I had mussels which were alright, but there were several that had a bit of grit. I probably wouldn't come here again being from out of town, but I could see this being an okay place for happy hour for the downtown business folk- if only they would turn on the AC and treat the wine properly!
