House Marinated Olives were the only thing I liked, other than my imported mexican coca-cola. The Roasted Marrow Bones, Red Onion Jam, Sea Salt, Sourdough Crostinis was aight. Also had the rabbit and my friend had the steak and eggs, hell to the naw. That shit cray. Food, no. Drinks, yes. I love martinis and theirs was pretty darn good.
