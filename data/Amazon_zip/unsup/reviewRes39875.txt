This place is great! If you know nothing about Korean food... RIP 24 hr. Korean restaurant on Lawrence. (Now Luxury Condominiums...) Who knows what I'm talking about? I still go occasionally, even though I once bit into glass which they claimed to be bone... I know I'm not the brightest bulb in the bunch, but I don't think squid bone is green. All I'm saying is proceed with caution while eating kim chi.
