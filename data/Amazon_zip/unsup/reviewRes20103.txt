I wish I could give it 4.5 stars! The sushi is great and reasonably priced. Same goes for the appetizers. The menu is more extensive than a lot of other sushi places, too, so I can always experiment and try new things. I really like that it's BYOB, too. The only complaint that I have is about the acoustics - it gets really loud in there, to the point where you have to shout across your table to have a conversation. Still, it's a regular date spot for me and my boyfriend!
