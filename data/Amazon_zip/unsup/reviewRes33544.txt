Sultan: A Haiku Wishy and washy are not my cup of tea. yet... Sultan's tastes of love. Seriously. Take my five stars, Sultan's, as a humble offering in response to my first, second, and third trips back up to the front to purchase additional baklava ($1!!! as sound a financial investment as one can make). And my compliments on the Zatter bread~ I actually had to Google the recipe on the way home. I've had you once. I will return.
