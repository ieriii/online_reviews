Let's see, where do I start? Everything is spectacular on the menu. I've had the asian chicken salad which is excellent, the BBQ Salmon which is delicious, the portobello burger which is awesome, the Turkey club which is above average, and the list goes on. They also have really good strawberry daiquiris and margaritas, and the spinach & artichoke dip is mouth watering good. The desserts- too- all good!
