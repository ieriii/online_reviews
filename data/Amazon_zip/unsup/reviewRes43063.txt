Bought a groupon here to try it. Will never go back. I needed two pizzas @ 6:30, so I called an hour and a half ahead of when I wanted the pizzas. When I got there @ 6:30, the girl told me it would be a couple of minutes. 20 minutes later they realized my pizzas were never made. There was no manager on duty to tell what happened, so I just got a shrug of the shoulders from the cashier and showed up 40 minutes late with the pizzas. Terrible customer service.
