Bro, this place is pretty good! I'm still trying to figure out the best Pho restaurants in Chicago. Although I've been eating all the wonderful Vietnamese restaurants in Westminster and LA, Chicago looks very promising. Especially with Tank Noodles and Pho 777.  So, another day of work and I'm slightly... dehydrated and uh.... little bit of headache... and..... Well, typical sign of being hangover? You are probably right. And what's better than piping hot bowl of pho? Nothing. It's cheap, fast and fills you up to your esophagus!  My usual #1 Large and Spring rolls. That's the stuff man. I don't really care for any peanut sauce though. I douse mine with good ol' sriracha! Thing i really like about this place is they ALWAYS give you ALOT of thai basil and sprouts which I love. But then again, it's the broth that makes this guy scream "Hell yeah bro, this is the bomb digity" Awesome place. Definitely on my top of my list! Place does get little loud at times, and it's fun to watch people walk through the freezing weather when you are enjoying hot bowl of bomb digity pho during winter.
