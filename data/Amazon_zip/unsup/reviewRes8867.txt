It has become my favorite restaurant.. A perfect one in every respect taste, service, quantity, price, ambience.. As great as a restaurant can be.. This time I ordered Lamb shank and koubideh.. Totally consistent with my last visit.. I have rarely had such a good meat anywhere else.. As I have mentioned, dissolving in mouth.. This time I tried Persian tea.. Nice aromatic refreshment after the food.. Worth trying! In all, as expected a fantastic experience!
