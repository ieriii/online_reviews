I've only been here once and I hate to say that it might be the last time. The food was good but it took way too long to get our order and some people got beef burger when it was supposed to be a turkey burger. I don't remember the waiter coming around too much either. I would be willing to go here to watch a game and grab drinks, but I might avoid the food part.
