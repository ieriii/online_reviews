I love Southern food. I grew up eating it, eat it every time I go home to Texas, stockpile recipes in my head to make for myself when I've been good, and when I hear of a good Southern food restaurant far away from the South I have to go. Big Jones hits the nail on the head again and again. The service is friendly. Not Southern friendly, but still, oh so nice. The corn cakes are great. I've yet to dunk them in a bowl of gumbo (shame on me), but the crumbly bread is perfect for a salty roux. Fried green tomatoes are exactly what the name implies. Don't expect a green tomato to knock your socks off, but if it's fried in a cornmeal batter and sprinkled with a little salt, it just might come close. Put it on a sandwich with some butter lettuce and bacon and you've got yourself a meal. But the thing I can't get over, the thing I daydream about, is the shrimp and grits. The shrimp are plump and sweet and as fresh as can be. And I didn't dare ask how they got their grits so creamy - butter, cream, cheese, all of the above. The chef is happy to make something you don't see on the menu, but they've made before (say, fried catfish and eggs on a Wednesday afternoon); the servers make excellent recommendations (ginger sweet tea); and if you eye that bottle of champagne that the bartender is pouring into delicate glasses just right, she'll probably slide a taste of it your way.
