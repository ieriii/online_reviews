My wife (she was my girlfriend at the time) and I went here to celebrate our 10th anniversary of dating. We each did the chef's menu, and our summary of our experience is: there was not a single course that made us say, "I would eat a whole entree of that." The only course I remember is a salmon with barbecue sauce that I swear tasted 100% exactly like the flavored powder on Lay's K.C. Masterpiece potato chips. Now, I like Lay's K.C. Masterpiece potato chips, but this is not the way to stand out with flavor. What was good? The sommelier and the wine selection. The service, while a little too formal for my tastes, was also spot on. Also, while we weren't in love with the flavors, the presentations and textures of each dish were absolutely outstanding. Tru is certainly an experience, just not quite the one we wanted.
