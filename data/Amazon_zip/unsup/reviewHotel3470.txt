Just got back from an almost week stay at the Allerton, and although I knew what we were getting into after reading all the reviews, I wasn't prepared for it!  Lots to say, both good and bad! The room was beyond small...my daughter and I could barely squeeze by one another in the bathroom and it was laid out very odd, didn't allow for much movement at all. The beds however, were divine! Sank into down pillows every night that were just heavenly...perfect when you've been running all over Chicagoland all day and night! Great location, right down the street from Water Tower, although the ER at Northwestern and the sirens got a bit old after a while. Elevators were definitely a challenge, but my daughter and I in good fun enjoyed chatting up people and trying to figure out which one went where. The elevators, like the rooms, were totally small and cramped, made for some interesting drunken conversations! Avoid the restaurant! We had their $19 brunch and pretty much every item was stone cold The Bell Staff, in a word, astounding...hilarious...helpful...sarcastic...since we were there for so long, we got to know many of them and we'd head out into the night hearing them warn us about no calls from the police to come pick us up or for us to behave. Always friendly, got cabs for us immediately, great suggestions for places to hang out...they made the stay fun...even if they couldn't believe we walked all over downtown, from Navy Pier to Huron 'on purpose'. All in all, a nice stay, but I will stay some place different next time I think. For the money, I am not sure its worth the cons...its almost a tie with the pros.
