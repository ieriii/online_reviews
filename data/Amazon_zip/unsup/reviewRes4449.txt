The Green Mill is such a classic place, it is impossible not to enjoy yourself there. It oozes Chicago. As they say, the drinks are cold and the music is hot! Great jazz, great old room, and if you are a Chicago history buff, this must be in your list of places to go. Being inside The Green Mill when the horns are blowing transports me back in time. Packed tight on the weekends, ut if you get there just a little early, you can usually still get a good seat.
