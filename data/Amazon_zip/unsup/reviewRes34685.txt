I still love the falafel sandwich here but I might have to start coming here by myself. The last 3 times after going here my wife has gotten sick, and she's always had an iron stomach. Nothing ever makes her sick... except the Sultan I guess. Combining her 1 star rating with my 5 brings this down to a 3.
