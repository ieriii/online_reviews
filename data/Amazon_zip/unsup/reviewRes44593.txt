Cute bakery with outdoor seating and a separate lounge next door with free wi-fi. The lounge is usually pretty quiet, which is good if you need to get some work done. They are also open fairly late. I usually order iced or hot coffee and most often they have soy milk out with the usual condiments. They also have about 8 different varieties of loose tea. I've tried the vegan cookie and the vegan apple streusel. I've had better vegan cookies but theirs is ok if you want some sweet carbs on the spot. I like the apple streusel much better. Sweetened apples with some raisins and granola bits. Yum.
