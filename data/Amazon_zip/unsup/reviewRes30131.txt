This is STILL my favorite restaurant in Chicago. I LOVE the food, drinks & atmosphere. Kristi at the front is such a great hostess and is so sweet! Although it is sometimes hard to get into, make reservations ahead of time or go in at lunch time for a less crowded scene. If you don't like a fun, loud, & upbeat scene- this may not be for you. The food is absolutely delicious! I can honestly say, I've never had a bad meal here. Some of my favorite items are: Rock Shrimp, Pork Belly Bao Buns, Baked Snow Crab Handroll, Lemongrass Beef Lollipops. (These are perfect on a tapas style basis, SHARE SHARE SHARE & find what you love!) If you love jalepenos and bacon? Sounds weird I know, the Crunchy Pig, Hidden Dragon is a must. The combination of lobster, avocado, bacon, jalepenos, with a sweet chili sauce in this specialty roll is amazing. My favorite drink at Sunda is the Strawberry Palmer, which is a mix of absolut wild tea mixed with strawberries, lemongrass and lemon juice topped off withlemon lime soda. Last but not least: YOU CANNOT go to Sunda without getting "The Ridiculous" - it is one of the best desserts I've had in a long time! It is a dessert that includes, tempura vanilla ice cream with carrot cake, glazed walnuts, caramel, & much more deliciousness!
