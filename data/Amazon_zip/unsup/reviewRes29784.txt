Took time to make a lunch reservation this time, since several months ago, I showed up at the restaurant at 5:30 p.m. and was told it would be a 3hr. wait for a table. I was really looking forward to this experience, but was disappointed by Frontera's ambiance and food. We were seated at a small slanting table, smashed in an overcrowded room. The Blood Orange Margarita (seasonal) was very good, followed by average guacamole , and grizzly steak tacos. Our waiter was inattentive, and never made eye contact with us. Nothing special here. Overall, Bobby Flay is far superior to Rick Bayless!!
