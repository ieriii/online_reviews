The food is great, however, the prices have recently skyrocketed, its still affordable, but not as good of deal, used to be i could get a flaffel for 3.00 and hummus for 3, and itd be like 6 something total, or whatever they felt like charging me, i was there a few days ago, and the same thing cost me 10.00.... again, not out rageous, but a big price hike in just a few months span
