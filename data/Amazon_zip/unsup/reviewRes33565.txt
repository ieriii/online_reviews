Definitely nothing special about this place. We went here for a friend's birthday brunch. We didn't have reservations, so it took about a half hour to be seated. We parked at validated parking garage next door, which is only 2 hour parking, so this made for a very rushed meal. I had the smoked salmon; was not impressed. The place was busy, so service was very slow. Also, although the restaurant is BYOB, they did not let us use the OJ my friends had brought for mimosas, even though one friend - the birthday girl - told our waitress she had called ahead and gotten the ok for this :-(
