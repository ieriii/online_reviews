Amazing persian food! I've eaten at several persian food restaurants in Chicago, and this is really the best place in the city. My parents and I always go back every few weeks because it's just that good.  The service here is amazing, they always bring out your food really quickly, and try to get you seated as soon as possible. And despite the fact that sometimes on the weekends it can get pretty busy, they always get you in within 10 minutes or so. Their kabobs are always tender and juicy and worth coming back for. Their eggplant appetizer is also really tasty. There are not many options for vegetarians, but they do have a few options on the menu that I'd definitely eat if I wasn't going to choose a kabob. If anyone is debating on whether to go to Reza's or noon o kabob, debate no longer, Reza's is very much like a chain restaurant and their kabobs lack the rich flavor that Noon o kabob delivers in all of their dishes. I used to go to Reza's because that was the only place available, but now that noon o kabob is in business, there is no way I'd ever go back to Reza's.  Noon o kabob is a small place, but it makes it very intimate and personalized, which is why the service is so efficient. I would recommend this place to everybody.
