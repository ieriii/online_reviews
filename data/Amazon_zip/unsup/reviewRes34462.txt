hands down the best falafel I've ever had. I wasn't the biggest fan of the "salad bar", myself, so I stick to the regular menu.  If you've ever wanted to try to falafel but had any doubts that you might not like it...let's just say that if you don't LOVE it from here, you'll definitely hate it from everywhere else.
