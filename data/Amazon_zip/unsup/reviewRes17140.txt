I think this one gets a five star just for atmosphere alone. It is a place with amazing food and no one feels uncomfortable. The decor is over the top, bright, vibrant and really sets the mood for the night. This is a great place for coworkers and groups of friends to go. While waiting for a table there is a large lounge that is a great place to start the evening, plenty of waiting room.
