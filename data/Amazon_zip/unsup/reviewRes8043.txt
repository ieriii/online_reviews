I have been in this place many times since they opened, always consistent with the food, but here is the mistake, I choose Fogo for New Years Eve. Thinking that besides the regular menu they may be a special night in someway. The gauchos in general were not in a great mood to be there. They didn't give the chance to the customers to have a New Year's toast. A few minutes after midnight they cut down the temperature in the restaurant. Finally, they start playing with the lights in the restaurant to invite you to leave. Fogo the chao would do everyone a favor if you are not ready to open on a Holiday night, please don't open your doors creating false expectations into the customers in a very special night.
