My husband and I support organic sustainable foods, small businesses, we take part in organic coops, put our kids in Waldorf school and so on. When we go out to eat we like it to fit our philosophy (which is rare to start with) good organic healthy food made with a bigger picture in mind. We were very exited about uncommon ground because it seems to fit some of our needs. Everything what fine, organic wine, good food, good service until someone ( I suppose it was the manager?) came rudely interrupted our conversation and said: I am sorry to interrupt but I have a full house and you need to leave. Well that was brusque! Although we tried not to let it bother us and left right away, it did leave us with a bitter taste in our mouths and actually our hearts too because we do like the place..
