I almost slipped and fell twice!! The floor is so greasy, an accident waiting to happen. My dad told me it's because they cook their food with lard, and the waitresses bring out the grease from the kitchen on their shoes. After that I was utterly disgusted, if that's the dining area what must the kitchen be like? I wish I would have known this before hand.
