Visited Indie this week for the first time. Service was efficient, but impersonal and hands-off, but I really didn't care since the food was so good. The La Fiesta roll was scrumptious and had a depth of flavor that can only come from really expertly prepared sushi rice. The curry pockets (can't remember what they are called) were really out of this world. LOVE! We brought a bottle of wine, paid no corkage - even though they sell wine. Another reason to heart them (and to avoid places that charge a ridiculously high corkage fee.)
