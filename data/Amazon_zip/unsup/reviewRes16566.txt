As you walk in you feel that the restaurant may be a bit upscale so I felt a little under dressed. But as I walked in I was greeted with a smile and the facility was fantastic. The food was great. I had a Groupon for India House. Even without the Groupon I would still visit. It was the first time I had ever had Indian food and I really enjoyed it! Thanks for the great job! The part I liked best, no wait at 7pm. I hear the buffet is awesome. I may try that next time!
