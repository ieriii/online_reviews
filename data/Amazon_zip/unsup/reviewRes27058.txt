I wanted to like it because it was one of the things I looked forward to in Chicago! Unfortunately it was a bit disappointing. It was crazy that people had to line up before it opened for dinner. The dining area wasn't big at all. If your place in line was at the entrance of Xoco, you probably would not be in the first round. Just to give you an idea, I had lined up 15 minutes before it opened on a Friday evening, and the group of 4 before me was told a 2 hour wait. Their drinks were really good. Torn among the different choices, I chose Blood Orange Margarita from the seasonal menu and Champagne Margarita from the classic menu. Bubbly margarita was good, not outstanding, but blood orange with Jamaican sugar on the rim was perfectly balanced between sweet and sour.  The Mole Trio was more like a sampler rather than different flavors complementing each other. Two of the three moles were either too salty or too vinegary. The only one mole that I had enjoyed was the roasted veggie with pumpkin seeds. It was rich, earthy and aromatic--ummm I could still remember the taste a month later. Last note, although this place did not work for me, on my way out of Chicago I had stopped by Tortas Frontera at O'Hare. It was hands down the best airport food ever.
