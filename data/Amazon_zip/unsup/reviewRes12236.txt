It's a cute and happy restaurant with exposed brick and interesting artwork but the space and decor totally trumped the food and drink. I got a margarita which was warm and very pulpy. Yay for using real lime juice but points off for the pulp. The mojitos were better. I have heard great things about the Honey Jalapeno Pork Chop but unfortunately for me I opted for the regular ol' pork chop which was bland and uninspiring. Best part of the meal were the side of sweet plaintains. Soft, succulent and delicately sweetened. I may come back but probably only for the plaintains and mojitos.
