So as I learned last night, it's not peanut sauce, it's bean paste. I figured my due diligence requires I should pass along this wealth of knowledge to you lovely people. Oh and despite SSGS really being known for its all out meat orgy factor, the sea options are actually quite fabulous. Go for the Octopus because not only is it spicy delicious, but saying "give me the 'puss" all night definitely ups your entertainment value.
