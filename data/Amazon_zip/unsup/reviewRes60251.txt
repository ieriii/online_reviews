Had a great time! The food is great and the line is not nearly as bad as it looks. They really run this place well, it's a nice mix between a sit down restaurant and a get it your self food counter.They find you a table and bring you the food but you need to get waters and silverware etc.For six people it was only $75 and that included 3 bloody mary's and coffee's for everyone.
