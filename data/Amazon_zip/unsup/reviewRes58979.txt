I really WANTED to like this restaurant. We live in River North and always get excited when something new opens up. My husband took me there last night for my birthday. The wait staff was extremely nice and I have to say the decor is really pretty. Other than that, there were no other redeeming qualities. Everyone commented on how trendy the crowd is at Sunda but I felt a bit over dressed and most people were just in jeans dressed down (it was a Sat night!).....so not that trendy. I ordered a drink which was served in a mug (looked like a soup bowl). Not classy. The food was rushed. In fact, our entree came out before our app! We ordered what the waitress recommended - Crab crusted ahi tuna and the firecracker roll. Don't go to Sunda hungry because the portion size is perfect for a toddler. Oh, and let me say they charged $16 for the ahi tuna which not seared at all and the consistently was mash potato-like. We each had a bite and left the rest on the plate. Plus, the food just did not look appetizing. The presentation was bland and nothing special. I'm really confused at the reviews who said the food is excellent??? Maybe we just ordered the wrong thing. We wanted to order more food but after having some of what we ordered we just quickly asked for the check. Oh, did I mention it was my bday? The waitress brought out a plate of ice cream scoops with dipping sauce. I would've been just fine with a candle stuck in a turd. Seriously. I was handed a generic bday card that was signed by the infamous Billy Dec himself. Awwww, that made my night......NOT. Conclusion, save your money and go to another one of Chicago's fabulous restaurants. There are hundreds of them so go have a decent meal somewhere else. It's also metallic concert loud in there so don't go on a first date, blind date, etc....or, at all.
