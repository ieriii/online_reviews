I've come here several times, mostly bringing out of town guests and it's always been a good experience. Except for the wait on weekend nights - they don't take reservations and it can be over an hour at peak times, so I try to avoid those. The food is ok, large portions. The desserts are awesome! My favorites are the molten lava cake, beignets, and pecan cookies, the latter two being excellent for sharing in a large group. I always order the dessert with the rest of my meal since they are made to order and take half an hour to bake. Oh, and the apple pie/tart is very good as well - flaky and buttery crust with apple slices in the middle, served with ice cream!
