OK, people, first of all, this is a biased review. If you don't like spicy and oily food, don't even think about going there, because you will NOT like it at all. Since I am from Chengdu, Sichuan (Sze Chuan) and the owner of this restaurant is from my home town, and I am by default biased. That being said, this restaurant does serve the most authentic Sichuan food I have ever had in the US.  Here are some suggestions if you are into spicy food: 1. Ma Po Tofu--one the most famous Sichuan Dish, must try 2. Twice cooked pork--see above 3. Dong Po Pork Elbow--this dish is named after the famous poet, so,  of course it's excellent 4. Water boiled beef/fish/pork--don't let the name fool you, cos it's not  bland, it's spicy and tasty 5. Spicy peppery soup (Ban Tang Yu Pian) 6. Never forgotten chicken--appetizer 7. Lai Lai Lai Chicken (in a pot) 9. Crispy Eggplants And many other more dishes that I can't remember all right now. But do try them if you like spicy food. If you are more adventurous, try the pig ear, rabbit meat, pig intestines, and perhaps blood soup. Although personally I am not too impressed by the last two. They also have hot pot. I tried it several times, but I still love the dishes better. My boyfriend loves the Ma Po ToFu and Water boiled beef the best so they are our staple every time we go. One last thing, the service is OK, and it's crowded during the weekends. They have upstairs, so ask for it when you get there if it's crowded and you might be able to be seated faster.
