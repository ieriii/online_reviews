Hipster pretention at its finest.  This place grows on me a little more each time I go. Usually the S.O. and I hit this place after dinner in Wicker Park. On occasion, if we feel obliged to spend exhorbitant amounts of money on really good booze, we'll just hang out and have a few cocktails with a couple of the fabulous plates of munchies.  What makes this place more fun than most is sitting at the bar and chatting with the bartender about the latest revelations in alcohol. We both love wine, but it's always fun to learn a little more about the world of cocktails. Other tip: just give the barkeep a liquor preference and a flavor palate (i.e. citrus, sweet, sour) and let him do his thing.
