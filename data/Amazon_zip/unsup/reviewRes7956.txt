My favorite thing about the place is saying the name real fast. It almost sounds Greek, like George Spaccanopolous, that guy on ABC. This was my third visit, and I had not been in several years. And this time I went with some regulars and got the royal treatment: special appetizers, a visit from the owner and the chef, Henry and his daughter Kate. As well as a swell line-up of insalata mista, and two of the same pizzas, a spicy pepperoni with fresh basil, a tiramasu (not made in-house but really one of the best I've had) and some cream puffs they had made with marscapone and drizzled with honey. Then two of us ordered after-dinner liqueurs which were a favorite of the owner, and they were really unique. Not usually in my repertoire, but I couldn't resist one with citrus, herbs and fennel. Really a nice ending to this meal. The food here is so fresh, the atmosphere inviting, the host so gracious, its just a great spot for brick oven Neopolitan pizza. Don't think you can go wrong. Unless you want to get stuffed from your pizza experience. It's more of your everything-in-moderation place. With a personal touch.
