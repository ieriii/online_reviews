I went for dinner on a Friday night and really enjoyed my experience at Big Jones. The food was delicious. We had the crawfish boudin and the fried cauliflower for starters and the fried catfish and red snapper on special for entrees. Everything was cooked perfectly and they presented a wonderful blend of flavors. The atmosphere in the restaurant is really pleasant and relaxing and the service was attentive. We will definitely be returning.
