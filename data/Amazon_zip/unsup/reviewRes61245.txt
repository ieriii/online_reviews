You know, as I read these reviews, I see the same comments. Good pizza, but terrible service. My Husband and I took a weekend to relax downtown and we were on a mission to find the best deep dish. The pizza was great (probably the best), but the service was the worst we had since our visit. We are excellent tippers, considering we've waited tables all throughout school, but this was the first time we left $1 for a tip. When we told the manager about it, he said "I'm sorry, Daniel is having a bad day." WOW!! This is not a time to be treating people as "business as usual." I suggest the owner get a new staff and manager.
