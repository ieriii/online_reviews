I LOVE Pequod's. Seriously, pretty much every other pizza place in the city can suck it. I live down the block from Lou Malnati's and go out of my way to avoid it. I desperately miss working on Clybourn and being able to hop in to Pequod's for their lunch special- $4.95 for a personal pan pizza and a beer is a steal. Can't get enough of the carmelized crust!
