Great service, great concept, food was ...okay. The Food Wish I could say it was better because we really wanted to like it, but the food was only okay. Pork tenderloin was on the dry side, top sirloin was a bit tough, etc. Linguica was very nice, though.  And my wife was really digging the fried polenta [and that's nice, but @ $48.50 per, the meat should really be very good]. The Drinks Wife liked her mojito, and I had a couple of Malbecs by the glass - okay, but like everyone else here has observed - a touch pricey [$11.50 for the mojito].  The servers Attentive, prompt, courteous. Best part of the experience, no question. The room Large. But well appointed, and somehow it didn't feel like we were in a place that is probably half the size of a football field.
