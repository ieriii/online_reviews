This place gets 5 stars for 2 reasons and 2 reasons only: 1) Amazing, creative thin crust pizza and you can even build your own. 2) They BREW THEIR OWN BEER! And it TASTES DELICIOUS! 3) Very accommodating of big groups, if you call ahead. 4) Servers are great, and the crowd is pretty good too. OK, more than 2 reasons I guess...
