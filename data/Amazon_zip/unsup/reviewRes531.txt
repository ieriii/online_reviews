The receptionist misheard me state my last name when I got there. It was the sincerest apology I have ever received. The mineral water was the saltiest I have ever tasted. The cube of foie gras: the most my tongue had ever been coated in saturated animal fat. Then at the end, our dessert was served by the nerdiest man I have ever met.
