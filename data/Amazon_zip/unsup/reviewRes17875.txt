We had the worst service imaginable. We were seated right away but then no server came to take our order for nearly 10 minutes. Once we did finally order we received our (over cooked) food and were able to eat it before any drinks arrived. In fact, we never received a single drink nor did a server check in with us to make sure everything was okay and explain the wait. When one of us finally got up to speak with the server (who was just standing around at the bar chatting with other servers) about the delay she was rude and unwilling to let us pay for the food and leave. We were really excited to try the drinks but they had taken over 30 minutes and were not even ready at that point. So, we finally gave the server cash for the food and a tip and left to get a martini at Blue Line (which came in about 3 minutes).
