Very happy with my dinner. Drinks: Yummy! Worth coming here just for drinks. I had two cocktails (one unlisted) and both were wonderful. (side note: the drinks aren't very large - but they pack a punch). Food: Very good. I ended up sharing 3 dishes and a dessert with a friend and all the dishes delivered. The coconut pie was especially delish! Overall: Relatively expensive ($65/person) with tip and tax but worth it. I was recently at another nearby restaurant where the grand total was about 15$ more pp and I was disappointed. After leaving gilt bar I felt both full and satisfied and I'd certainly go back. Seriously though you have to try a few drinks here!
