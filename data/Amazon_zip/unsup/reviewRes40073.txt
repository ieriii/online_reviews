Had the burger and was deeeelish, but i give it three stars because I'm not too sure it was worth the 2.5 hour wait. Got there at 7:40 and we got seated at 10. Plus, the kitchen is in the middle of the restaurant - as u walk in you get hit with burger smelling smoke. I like burgers but don't want to smell like one.
