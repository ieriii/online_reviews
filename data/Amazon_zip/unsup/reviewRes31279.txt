Second day of 'regular' opening and everything went like clockwork. We were in good hands and everyone appeared to know what they were doing and did it well. The place is beautiful, the bar area charming--sitting low by the windows on Illinois. The restaurant while having some potential for noisy was just fantastic with a lot of interesting spaces at the bar, at the long tables, at the sushi bar and other we did not explore. But go for the food. The crab roll slightly warm and crunchy with REAL crab meat melted in your mouth (well, ours). The black cod, one of my favorites, was perfectly seasoned and also perfectly cooked. Our wait person, Sarah, insisted we try a dessert which we rarely do and the banana fritters (I don't know what they are called on the menu--they just appeared) with crunchy coconut coating and a berry dip and think whipped cream on the side made us every happier than we had been! The mixed drinks. I had one with mango in it and was concerned it would be too sweet. So the bartender made it less sweet and not only the liquid really fabulous, but the chili--sesame coating on the glass made me swoon. This is absolutely going to be the 'in' place--and I hope the prices stay as reasonable as we found them to be.
