I heard good things about this place so I thought we would try it for a birthday dinner. First, our party of 6 was told there would be a 15 minute wait. That 15 turned into an hour and a half. I understand they are busy, but why tell me 15 minutes is you know the wait is much longer. Once we finally got a table (which was switched twice since the host forgot how many people are in our party) we thought we'd get their "best of 2010 burger." Who ever made that claim needs to check their taste buds cause the food was average at best. The fries were good, but the burger was sub par, not to mention the devasting effect it had for the following day. Overall, the 2 and a half hours spent in this join was a complete waste. Don't do it.
