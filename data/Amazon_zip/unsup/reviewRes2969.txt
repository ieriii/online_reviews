It works. The atmosphere, detail in service, polished food, as a whole, it works. The wife was impressed with the chair for her purse, I think the replacing of your napkin while you are at the restroom is borderline unnecessary, but from the valet, amuse bouche, polished food and dessert to the little cake (that takes three days to make) they give you to take home to have next morning with your coffee... Everything is thought out... Go on your birthday, they print a menu with a special message. The wife and I have even been just for the dessert only sitting. I think you are allow to book it after 10:30pm or 11pm. We usually goto a play/show or opera, and head there for a late night dessert. Couple a glass or two of champagne with Gand's dessert tasting is the perfect way to end date night.
