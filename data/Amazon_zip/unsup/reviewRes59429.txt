This was my first visit to this location. With the Randolph street location there isn't really much of a wait, but we waited about an hour at this location. After we put our name in they let you order your pizza since it does take about 45 minutes to cook. I would add about 1 or 2 people to the recommended people a pizza can feed if you are ordering the stuffed pizza. they seem to under estimate it by about 1 o 2 people.
