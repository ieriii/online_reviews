Horrible example of mexican food. I ordered the combination plate, enchilladas and quesadillas with chicken. I couldn't even tell that the enchiladas where enchiladas in comparison to the quesadillas. I asked for red sauce on them, and they came looking like a rolled up quesadailla. I asked for an additional side of red sauce sinc eit wasn't visible nor could not be tasted,, and when it came it was red colored water. Maybe a teaspoon full of tomato base in the whole bowl, than just water. It was nasty, runny and flavorless. They went overboard on the cheese, the chicken was all dark meat and then my server charged me $1.50 for the water sauce. I used to like this place, but now I will never return.
