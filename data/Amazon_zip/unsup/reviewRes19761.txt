Wow. Just, wow. After two failed attempts to eat at Frontera, if this place is any indication of how good Rick Bayless does it, I'll wait 4 hours! (Ok, no, but it's the thought that counts.) We wandered around the corner after getting the bad news about the Frontera wait time. The place was packed--this is obviously a theme when it comes to his spots! But, we decided to get it to go, and we pranced right up to the counter to order. Two tortas and a churro, please. I don't know how to adequately describe the taste sensation that took place in my mouth. In all honesty, it's still a blur. I remember getting my torta, and then looking down and realizing that I'd finished. Love the food. Love the concept. Love the Bayless. Frontera or bust!
