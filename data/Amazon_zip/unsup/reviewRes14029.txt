Um, I'm kind of in love with this hole in the wall place. The food is consistently fabulous. The tofu sandwich will knock any meat-a-tarian's socks off. The crispy fried plantains are sinfully good as well. My other half loves the cuban sandwiches and the rice and beans. The people are always friendly in this tiny place. The cuban music blares through the speakers and you really might just feel like you're in another world while eating there. They also do lots of takeout and delivery, if it's too crowded for your taste!
