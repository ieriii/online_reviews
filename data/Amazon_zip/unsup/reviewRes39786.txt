This place used to be a 5 but the quality seems to have gone down. Plus, they used to be open 24 hours which was awesome as we could hit up San Soo Gab San after a night of partying..I believe they close at 5am now . Overall, the food is still pretty darn good; my favorites are the kalbi and goat stew-yes I said goat stew!- but be warned if you haven't gone here before, the service is typically bad so you might have to chase down some servers for extra things. Oh, and be prepared to smell like Korean bbq for the rest of the day!
