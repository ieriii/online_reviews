My girlfriend took me here to celebrate the fact that she had just gotten a job and could proudly pick up the check. Happy times. We had a salumi platter and I had the tagliatelle with boar ragu. Really, really good. Then my girlfriend put down her new credit card. Apparently, it had not yet been activated, a fact that we, and about 30 other diners, were alerted to when he came back and loudly announced, "THIS CARD NO GOOD. PAY ANOTHER WAY." So I did. And we left. And we won't be coming back.  I have been a waiter and there are ways to handle this. He chose the embarrassing, rude way and, unfortunately, needlessly ruined a nice occasion. Good food, poor manners. With the competition in this town, I'll go elsewhere for good Italian food.
