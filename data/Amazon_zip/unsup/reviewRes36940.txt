Finally got my chance to eat here. The wait wasn't too bad although I have heard it can be pretty hoppin'. I have heard the food is as impressive as the beer selection. The potato croquettes were awesome, crunchy and soft on the inside. The frites were also delish! The sandwiches are so hearty that we couldn't order dessert. I have to come back and try something new. The meal is as solid as the beer selection.
