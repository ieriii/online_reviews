Being the aspiring foodie that I am, I was dying to visit Rick Bayless' joint while I was in town. I love that he uses a lot of organic, local and sustainable ingredients to create amazing gourmet versions of traditional Mexican food. I decided to splurge and take myself to Frontera. I was alone and sat at the bar, so I didn't have to wait long. I started with a couple of basic margaritas on the rocks and they were perfect. And then I had the most amazing grilled duck breast with this amazing two-chili and sesame seed sauce, spinach and a garlicky butternut squash puree. It came with warm corn homemade tortillas that I sopped up every last drop with. If you've never had warm, homemade tortillas, I'm pretty sure you haven't lived. To top all of this off, I had another margarita and an absolutely divine flan with mixed berries.  I hate to use the term "foodgasm," but I must. I'm pretty sure my meal here was better than sex.  And actually, if I hadn't had three drinks and dessert, it really wouldn't have been all that pricey.
