Okay...I lived in Tokyo for 10 years and am a serious sushi snob. I generally dislike sushi in Chicago. Arlington Heights has some good places and there's one in Evanston...but the sushi in Chicago is generally not good for one simple reason...the rice is horrible. They often don't have the right amount of water so it's too mushy on one end of the scale or it's not cooked completely on the other end. The other rice problem is real sushi should have vinegar and sugar added to the sushi rice. This is nearly never done in Chicago. (Yes...I've been to all the expensive places (Tank, yada, yada) and they generally are not good.) So, begrudgingly I went to Wakamono when forced to...I got ready to be disappointed...and WASN'T! Their rice was well cooked and it had a slight tang of sweet vinegar! Could have been more...but I'll take any in the land of bland rice. I'm traditional in the sushi I like...so the fancy sauces and avocado never made it to our table...innovation in sushi is a crime!! (I told you I'm a snob.) However, the fish and veggies that did make it to our table were not bad...which means really good for Chicago! Why not 5 stars? EXPENSIVE and we went with kids. It's a "scene" at Wakamono and they shuffled us way to the back corner to make sure the hip and beautiful people didn't see the kids.
