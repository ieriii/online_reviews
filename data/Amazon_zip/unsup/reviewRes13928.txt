This is such a cool little place. Right next to the Montrose Brown Line station, it is such a great find! I love the fact that you can go in there and order any cereal you ate as a child (Lucky Charms, Coco Puffs, Fruit Loops, etc) or order some great food made with the freshest ingredients. It's a small little place but definetly worth waiting for a table. I had a fabulous vegetarian sandwich and our server was funny and polite. I enjoyed everything about the place. Go here!
