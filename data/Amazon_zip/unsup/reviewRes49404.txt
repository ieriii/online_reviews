We were super happy we found this place. It's large, airy and had 2 large oval shaped bars among the dining spaces. We stopped in for a before dinner drink and ended up a little buzzed when we left. We both had "flights" which are 4 wines from the same category but from different places around the globe. I did the sparkling flight and the hubby did a Pinot flight It really gave us a chance to experience and contrast what we liked and disliked about each one. Unlike, wine tasting, there isn't somebody there telling you what to think. It's a classy clean modern bar and you can drink in whatever order you please! We ended up needing to kill a little more time before dinner and went for half pours of dessert and a crme brulee. Yummy! Fantastic place for drinks before dinner! Highly recommend a flight!
