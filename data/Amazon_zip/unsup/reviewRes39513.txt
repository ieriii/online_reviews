Update: I went back to L&E with out-of-town family because I knew they would like it. Much to my delight, they've added a few vegetarian dishes and even had a vegetarian insert in the menu! That was swell for me and my vegetarian sister-in-law. I'm a vegan now, and so I got an awesome salad minus the cheese and again, the cauliflower dish, but it tasted much better this time- I'm not sure what they changed, but it was tasty! The server was great, and even made sure to ask if I could have my dish cooked in butter, which I hadn't even thought about because I'm so used to cooking with olive oil. We had a long wait- 2 hours- and a table of VIP politicians got to jump in front of us in line, but it's Chicago- what do you expect? Also, I got a very nice response from the owner of L&E after my previous review, which I greatly appreciated. I'm glad I went back!
