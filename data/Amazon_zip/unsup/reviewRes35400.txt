There are two sides to the restaurant. Both have bars, but one side is a little more formal and the other is less. We opted for the more casual side where there was a really nice 4-piece blues quartet playing. Food was really good - wide selection of oysters, and everything else you'd expect. Good selection of beers including Anchor Steam and several Belgians. Service quality and timing very very good. Great food and service, warm atmosphere and blues band playing reggae on a blustery Chicago night. I'm happy.
