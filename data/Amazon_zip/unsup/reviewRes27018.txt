Good food, long wait, decent service. My friends and I went to Frontera for my birthday dinner last Friday and I was mostly happy about the experience. I called a few weeks beforehand to try to make a reservation (silly me) and was told that they book 2-3 months in advance for Fridays and Saturdays. So we got in line around 5:00 PM, right before they opened. We finally got in and were quoted a 2.5 hour wait, so we went over to Paris club for a drink, and then back to Frontera to have drinks and some chips/guac (Guac was delish!). We ended up waiting the full 2.5 hours before being seated. Sine we didn't want to eat a ton, we shared four small plates: -Halibut ceviche (on special), garnished with lime and jalepeno: really fresh, light and with a bit of a kick. Good but sort of lackluster presentation. -Classic Queso Fundito: the table's favorite. Creamy, cheesy, salty and delicious. -Mole Poblano Enchiladas: Mole sauce was amazing and not too sweet/chocolatey. -Molotes: the description made these sound tamale-like, but they ended up being these little fried pyramids. They were decent, but not our favorite. Dessert: Strawberry shortcake- fresh, in-season strawberries on the best shortcake I've ever had, garnished with edible flowers. Looked and tasted beautiful Service: not so good. Our server seemed annoyed that we only ordered small plates. Also, my friend mentioned to our server it was my birthday and she made a big stink about the fact that we "had to order a dessert" and that all she could do was put a candle in it. Fine. But when the dessert came, there was no candle and the server seemed to have totally forgotten about the whole thing. All in all, the food was good but I don't think I'd be willing to wait another 2.5 hours for good (not great) food and not so good service.
