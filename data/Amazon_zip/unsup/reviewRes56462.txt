First of all, our server was AMAZING! She was so funny and extremely knowledgeable. She didn't skip a beat when we asked for her recommendations and listed suggestions off of each part of the menu. Service is always such an important part and I was really excited by the service. Secondly, every drink I had was delicious! My friend and I split the champagne margarita and boy did it go down smoothly. Then I had the tamarind margarita which I was a little iffy about, but why not go a little crazy. Ummmm seriously so good. It was spicy and smooth and really interesting. The food was also really good and extremely interesting. My shrimp dish had fern as an accompaniment, like the kind you see when you're hiking. And it was surprisingly good. The one dish I would really, really recommend is the queso fundido de carnitas. It was a very different take on a common dish. Overall, I would love to go back here and would highly recommend it.
