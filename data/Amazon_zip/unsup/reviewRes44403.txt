Oh wow, how did I forget to write a review of Alliance? I ordered a small cake from here for a friend who was moving away from Chicago. The first time I called, I got put on hold for a while and gave up on the call. The second time I had no problems, so I'll give benefit of the doubt here and assume the first was an accident. The gentleman I talked to was terrific. I knew I wanted chocolate mousse as the filing and vanilla cake. However, the frosting was a toss-up, so I asked the person taking my order what he would recommend. He immediately recommended vanilla buttercream.  This cake was perfect. Delicious. Lovely. The decoration was so tasteful. One cake-eater told me a few weeks later that she was still thinking about the cake with love. It clearly inspired her to want another. I will order from here again when I have the time to travel to pick it up. Great experience. While the picture exists, you can see it here: http://yfrog.com/ekgd7fj
