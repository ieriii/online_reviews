Dined here with the husband and a friend on a Wednesday night (4/14). We all had cocktails. I ordered vodka up with a twist. Our friend had an apple martini. The husband ordered a vodka on the rocks with a twist. However, the husband got a vodka martini on the rocks with a twist---he took one sip and started looking for our waiter. Finally I asked another waiter to look for our guy---in the mean time, my husband was sitting there for at least 15-20 minutes with his undrinkable drink, miserable. Finally our waiter appeared, cheerfully got a replacement cocktail in short order and we were able to proceed. After that, we all needed another round when the time came and weren't ready to order until we were about halfway through those cocktails. Our waiter was most patient with us. We all chose to order from the fixed price menu. The husband and I had the halibut, our friend had the prime rib. I had a salad and strawberry rhubarb pie for dessert. We had a wonderful time. The food was good, the service was good, the ambience was very nice. Valet parking. But it was a bit pricey---$32 per person for the fixed price 3 course option. Drinks were pricey as well!  This is a once in a while place---maybe one or two times per year, in my opinion.
