Ok, so the line is the most ridiculous part of this whole experience. It's absolutely crazy insane (they quoted us over 90 minutes of wait time at 2:45pm on a Sunday). So we skipped it -- they do takeout after 3pm. Also if you only want churros, pastries, or hot cocoa, you can skip the wait and move right up to the counter anytime. That said, it's casual, but Rick Bayless really knows what he's doing (yet again). The Aztec Hot Cocoa is delightful, but the churros were the best part. It's not your average fried dough with sugar stick. These are carefully handmade and then fried to perfection with more seasoning and taste than just cinnamon sugar. I'll be back and will know to wait and get takeout from here when I'm back in Chicago..
