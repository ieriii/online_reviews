Went to FINALLY try out Dale and Sara's food this past weekend and I only have one word that doesn't even do the food justice...WOWOWOWO!! This restaurant is a MUST try over and over and over again. The menu is simplistic and fantastic, and with each dish you are pleasantly surprised by the different flavors you experience. I had the octopus appetizer--which was awesome, the lamb dish which was just incredible and the lemon dessert. I recommend trying out the apple dessert--whoa! And the short rib entree is to die for...oh and the sturgeon is INCREDIBLE! Bravo to Dale and Sara....they are both so talented and I look forward to many meals at Sprout!!!! GO!
