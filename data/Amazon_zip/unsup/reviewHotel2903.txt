Look - with a name like Sheraton you'd expect to get: * Fantastic Service * Clean atmosphere * Modern and updated facilities * Wireless Capabilities * Wired internet INCLUDED in the price Fact of the matter the Sheraton Chicago is a poor excuse of a facility. It offers none of these things. The food was bad, the service for the conference was poor and disorganized (plates and forks were dropped repeatedly during our clean up service during our lunch conference meeting - this is both loud and obnoxious.) Seriously... how do you charge me $180 a night for a crumby hotel room with old AC units and then turn around and make me pay $13 for a WIRED service? Ashtrays inside the bathroom? What is this, the 1980s? Free WiFi in lobby sucks. The Microsoft Lobby was cool... and so was the access to PCs in the Cafe (that gets you 2 stars... BARELY) I would not advise anyone stay here especially if you are use to staying at a hotel that looks and feels anything above a Super8.
