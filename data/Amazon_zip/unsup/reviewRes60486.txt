Delicious food, totally amazing atmosphere. Wilde used to be an old Baroque library. When converted to a restaurant, the decor stayed. Beautiful atmosphere. The food is a little pricey, but food is very rich and filling. I recommend the macaroni and cheese (not your mom's old macaroni and cheese, I tell ya) and the lemon half-chicken. Amazing.A wonderful place for date night, a very romantic place. However, go there with friends too. Very fun. However, not a place to go if you need a place to talk, it's very loud and darkly lit.
