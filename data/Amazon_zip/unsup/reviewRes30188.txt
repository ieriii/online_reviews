If I even think about going somewhere else for breakfast, my boyfriend gives me a funny look like, "Really, you want to eat somewhere other than Third Coast?" It is a cute breakfast place and if you sit in the upper level you take away the hustle and bustle of regular breakfast traffic. Their bacon is REALLY good. I am not really a meat eater(except bacon) so I generally get my bacon well-well done. Third Coast is one of the few places I will eat it just as it comes. I have never had to wait more than 5 minutes to get seated, even with groups of 8 or 9 people. The service is sometimes slow, like it is everyone who works there's first day, but the food compensates for the wait.
