This Lettuce Entertain You outpost has all the charm and feel of an old-time Chicago steakhouse but substitutes the bovine for all things seafood & crab (and does so very nicely). Came in with the wife's fam for dinner while they were visiting on a last minute reservation. The waiting area is basically the bar, which was convenient, as they shake up a mean dirty martini. The main dining room is white tablecloths, pop art evoking Chicago a-la the roaring 20's and formal but effective service. We went with the family style lobster dinner and added an order of king crab legs just for good measure. I've yet to meet a lobster or crab I didn't like. The rest of the meal was good but nothing special. The clam chowder was nice and I tried the lobster bisque as well which is another one that in the right quantity is pretty much always going to be a knockout. The key lime pie for dessert was quite good, though perhaps not the best example I've ever had (perhaps due to the fact that I grew up in Florida where I humbly submit we still do Key Lime Pie best). I'm not positive I'd go back given the plethora of amazing dining choices Chicago has to offer, but totally worth it at least once.
