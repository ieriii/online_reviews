The food is awesome! No complain in that. But the waitresses are straight up bitches. They're real stuck up for no reason. Don't even bother to check up on you. Worst 3 experiences I have had there. One of the waitresses there was holding a glass of water at the top rim where one drinks out of. That's disgusting. If you don't know the health sanitations in waitressing, please don't bother working at a restaurant.
