Had lunch at Grunts today with my mom. Been here many times over the years as it always has been a special place for my family and I. It's a great place to go right after you go to the zoo or are just in the neighborhood. They hands down have the best milkshakes in the city and are one of the few places that actually listen when you tell them to make it "thick"! (chocolate peanut butter shake today). I had the regular cheeseburger (cheddar) which was excellent and my mom had the mushroom cheese burger which of course she couldn't finish (but brought home). If your in neighborhood, check out Grunts.
