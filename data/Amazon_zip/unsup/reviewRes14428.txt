Menu was really interesting, food was delicious, service was good, beer list was extensive. Outside of the fact that it was really loud and got pretty busy, we had a great experience! We didn't try many of the beers, but the Rosa was nice and summery. Our waiter recommended the cider mussels which were amazing and the twice baked potato pizza, which was good as well. Dessert was the chocolate chunk break pudding which was moist and delicious. I would absolutely go back, but maybe at a different time or during the week.
