Crisp. Great wings, relaxed atmosphere, and to die for Seoul Sassy sauce. The only negative thing about this place is when you walk in and get a to-go order there is no where for you to stand. Everywhere you walk you get in someone's way. The foodie special sandwich is also a real winner. I have not tried their bowls yet because I am hooked on the wings. Very relaxed staff that works there.
