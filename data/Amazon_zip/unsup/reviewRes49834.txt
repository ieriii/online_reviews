Las Tablas is amazing. I don't know of many places where you can get an large, amazingly cooked and seasoned steak as well as grilled shrimp and fried plantain for 20 bucks! They were able to accommodate my party of 13 last minute as well, which was totally awesome! Everyone at the table was very satisfied, and everything came out well prepared and in a timely fashion. The coconut flan was also so delicious! DEFINITELY DEFINITELY GO!
