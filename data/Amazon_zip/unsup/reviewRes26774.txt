3 couples went to Graham Elliot on New Years Eve for dinner. Of course they had a special menu which we were prepared for. I think it was 10 courses and for an additional charge they paired wine/cocktails with the courses. I enjoyed everyone of the courses but one. The ravioli was by far the table favorite and the white fish with cauliflower was by far the least favorite. It had very little flavor. The mushroom ravioli on the other hand left everyone hoping for a second helping. Otherwise everyone had a really nice time although we felt a little bit rushed but that could have been that they needed the table for the next reservation but when you are spending over $1200 for the table you don't really want to feel rushed through the courses. The service was very good as each drink pairing and course was explained completely. The drinks we got from the bar before the meal were excellent. Parking is street but the brown line is really close by. I am sure eventually I will be back just not sure when.
