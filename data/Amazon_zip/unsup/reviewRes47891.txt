I really can't figure out what happened with some of the really negative reviews here, except for the fact that maybe Zed got some of this negative feedback themselves and decided to adjust. I took my boyfriend there last weekend for his birthday and once again found it to be nothing but classy. We went on a Sunday night, which meant the restaurant wasn't super-crowded.  Just as with the opening, I had trouble not going gaga at the Harvest Tables; once again I was quite impressed with the food there. The staff bringing around the meat and other food items were extremely polite and helpful. If they didn't have what we wanted, they'd offer to send someone over with whatever it was. Some highlights were: -bison with red wine reduction -48 hour marinated bottom roast -small cuts of PERFECTLY rare ahi tuna -slow roasted leg of lamb I cannot repeat how unbelievably attentive the staff was in bringing us literally anything we wanted as many times as we could possibly wish them to. Again, I don't know if this is just typical Sunday night non-rush dining or what. I also tried a wine flight that was delicious.  Place is still pretty darn pricey, but my boyfriend, a true meat lover who'd never eaten at a Brazillian style steakhouse was googly eyed the whole time which was EXACTLY what I'd hoped for.
