The place is super dirty. I don't even want to venture to guess what the kitchen looks like. And you might be thinking this is one of those places that looks like a hole but puts together great food, but no. The meat was pretty dry and the veggies were not fresh at all. Better bring lots of booze so you can make sure you can get the food down. Or better yet, just don't bother going there.
