(Review #1) We all love this place, but please stop spreading this "24 hour" nonsense. SSGS usually shuts down by 4:30-5am ish? Last time I walked in at ~5am, I got DEE-NIED. I'm not the first one to get denied so I wouldn't want you to have the same craving at 5am. Walked out w/ my head hung low and wanted to steal some yook-ge-jiang from the last table still dining.
