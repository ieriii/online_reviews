Visiting Chicago for a wedding and had time to grab dinner before flying home. Had several friends who recommended Zed451 instead of our planned trip to Fogo de Chao. Glad we tried it. The most amazing thing about Zed451 is the "Harvest Table". An amazing selection of cheeses and charcuterie. I really wish that one could get just the Harvest Table and skip the entire churrascaria aspect of the restaurant. Not that the meat wasn't good, but man...more than enough to explore without it. We went during Restaurant Week but decided to go with the full menu. Unfortunately for half of our meal, they had mistakenly marked down that we wanted the limited menu, so we were getting skipped on half the good stuff! After noticing this, they profusely apologized and a sudden rush of servers hit our table. The one thing I did really miss though from Fogo de Chao and other Brazillian-style churrascarias is the pan de quejao. The little muffin things here were....underwhelming. And the foccacia from the bar was good, but a variety would be nice. And last but not least, dessert. I ordered the Bread Pudding a la mode and my wife got the Banana Cream Pie. I won. The Bread pudding was amazing. And I have tried looots of bread puddings. Perfect consistency, with a beautiful blend of sweetness and creaminess without being cloying. Glad I added the a la mode. So overall, great harvest table, solid grilled meats and an amazing bread pudding. But when push comes to shove, I still love the Fogo.
