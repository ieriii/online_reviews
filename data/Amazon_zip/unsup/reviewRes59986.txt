I really like Big Jones. It's the one place that I have to visit when I go to Chicago.I've always been happy with brunch - good popovers, beignets, benedict, and shrimp and grits. I've liked all of the cocktails and dinner specials. I probably wouldn't order the gumbo again- not because it wasn't good, but because it's not really what I'm looking for when I go out.The staff is always competent and friendly. The restaurant cares about what they're doing and trying to be better at what they do. I wish I could have been there for the wood fired oysters!
