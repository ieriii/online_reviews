The food here is quite good. I highly recommend both the mapo tofu and the salt and pepper lamb. Tony's Chicken is also quite good, though both the lamb and the chicken are quite dry. I didn't think anything at this restaurant was amazing, but everything was very good. I'm definitely planning to go back.
