I went here the other night with some friends. We didn't have to wait and it was a Friday. The service was excellent: fast, friendly and fun.  They have a huge selection of items and the prices aren't ridiculous like some nicer restaurants seem to be. The appetizers were probably the best part of the meal and if I go back I might just order a couple of appetizers instead of one of the entrees. We had the saganaki and taramosalata both were delicious. Well prepared and fresh! For dinner I had the stuffed lamb which I probably won't get again. It wasn't the restaurants fault I just didn't realize how much I dislike feta cheese. The entrees my friends had were great.  The only complaint I had is that there were fish bones in my gumbo soup. If my friend hadn't of warned me (he got the same thing) I could've choked. Try to stick to a soup with no bone potential. Other than that the ambiance was fun and upbeat and I would probably go here again.
