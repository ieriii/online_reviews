I enjoy this place for Vietnamese sit-down eating. Unfortunately, I don't eat seafood so my options are somewhat limited, so consider that i haven't had any dishes here with fruits de la mer. The food here is solid, and they have a wide variety of items under each category and I've been a few times and whatever we order has been good. I've had friends who have ordered pho, and they like it. However, be prepared to have things like tendon floating around in it, this place seems to be catering toward a more Vietnamese crowd in general so. There's obviously a lot of similarities to Chinese food, so if you like that cuisine, odds are you'll like Vietnamese. The Vietnamese hoaggies aren't that great here. If that's what you desire get them at Bale across the street.
