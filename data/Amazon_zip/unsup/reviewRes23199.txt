The original, the best, I don't eat beef or pork with the open exception of Superdawg (it's simply that good). Chicagoans are known for our bias...(baseball team, pizza place, hot dog place, etc). Some people like other dog places, good for them. But for my money, the original superdawg is the best Chicago dog out there. The pickled tomatillo is one of the nicest touches, and the dog is so thick and lightly spiced. Awesome. The malts are delicious as well.
