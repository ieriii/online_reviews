I really wanted to hate this place. Seriously. I thought it was all style, pomp, and frills, with no substance to back it up. It was too "sceney" and for some reason, reminded me of Ke$ha (don't ask). So it was up to Sunda to prove me wrong. And it did. Now, I know that Sunda does not try to be a sushi joint--it's Pan-Asian, and sushi does not display prominently. But I may have just fell in sashimi love. Perhaps some of the best maguro I've had in Chicago. And freaking giant scallops. Rich, buttery salmon chunks. Absolute love. While I only went with the raw fish and rice, my fellow diners went with curries, and they both raved about them. Service was impeccable. Friendly, attentive, and professional. And I have to say, I don't know what they do to their Diet Coke, but it may have been the best Diet Coke I've ever tasted (for reals). So what keeps it from 5-stars? Little annoyances mostly: ~They don't leave the soy sauce on the table for you to refill your dish. They were attentive in coming back around to fill, but I disliked not being the Master of my Dominion. ~Ginger was severely lacking. Not enough of it, and rather flavorless. Meh. ~This place is LOUD. Even for lunch, I had a hard time hearing my companions. I can't imagine what it's like in the evenings. I suppose its supposed to be that way, but I prefer to have a conversation while I eat. ~Some lunch options are pretty reasonably priced, but the nigiri and sashimi options are some of the priciest I've seen in Chicago. While I rave about the quality, when you look at bang for your buck, it's not as tempting. $16 for four pieces of tuna sashimi. $8 bucks for two scallop nigiri. Etc. Adds up reeeeallly quickly. (read: I love it because it was on the company's dime) I think I'll be back for "Sunda Social"--happy hour from 5-7--drinks look fantastic and the deals look pretty damn good.
