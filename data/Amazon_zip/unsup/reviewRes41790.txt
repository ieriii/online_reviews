My high rating for Gilt is pretty much based on the ambiance. We sat in the lounge area and had a GREAT time. It's a really cool place.  The service was actually really slow. That was disappointing. I want to give them the benefit of the doubt, because we kind of had a large group - with like 10 people. But still... I'm tempted to put them down to 3 stars because of that. Overall though, time flew while we were there, so I'm not gonna complain. I'll definitely give them another shot and definitely need to try the food next time.
