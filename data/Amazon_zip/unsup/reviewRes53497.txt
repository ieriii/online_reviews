Canyou say delicous. When i wen to HOt Doug this weekend the first thing I though was who would pay $7 dollars for a regualr size hot dog, but when I saw the menu it had a variety of different hot dogs and choices you could choose from. The service was very very slow here but I believe every second was worth the wait! The people here were really nice and you felt like you were in a nice enviormnt even though lines were out the door. The store does not look that appelaing when you first look at it, but I can surely say the food really backs it up. I would more than likely go back becasue I can honestly say the food was delicous!
