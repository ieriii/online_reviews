Very cute place! I came for a birthday dinner, and we were seated in the back, "outdoors", but being winter it was enclosed in a giant heated tent.  I was sitting up against the tent wall and it was QUITE drafty... it took a lot of will power to even take off my coat, but I felt rude leaving it on the whole time. In a strange turn of events (or a universal twilight zone), I was not that hungry (WHAT?!) so I ordered soup. However, I did try my friend's wild boar pasta, which was delicious. I had the special soup, which was also good and hit the spot. It was eggplant and squash pureed with EVOO on top. The bread they give you is delicious! It also tastes like it's infused with EVOO, and some other spices (not spicy spices, tasty flavorful ones). I was supposed to include a description of the bread by Izzy W. but now I've forgotten how she so eloquently put it. Since it was a birthday dinner, we called the Host, or Maitre D or sommolier (not sure what his job was) over. My friend thinks he looks like Barack Obama (she's wrong). We asked him 1. Not to sing happy birthday to our friend because it would embarrass her and 2. To let her pick out her dessert (he said for birthdays they write "Happy Birthday, Name" on the dessert). We told him her name and how to spell it. He also said he never sings and has a terrible voice and assured us that wouldn't happen. There must have been a communication break down because our bubbly italian waiter (who accused at least 2 of us of being on a diet for not ordering enough, but it was endearing) brings a dessert she didn't pick out that said HAPPY BIRTHDAY (sans name) on it and he starts singing in a thick italian accent... HEAAAAPPY BIRRRTHDAYYYY..... rats. foiled. communication breakdown. Barack Obama, why didn't you tell anyone of our plans? Oh well, it's ok, we still had fun, and good food! Overall a lovely experience.
