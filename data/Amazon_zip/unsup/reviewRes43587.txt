Should of came on a Sat or Sun for some of their famous huevos rancheros. Instead we were here on a Thursday morning and was it humming with people. Definitely didn't expect it to be busy at all! Went with the orange brioche french toast and can't seem to remember what the dining partner ordered. Obviously, not memorable.  French toast was good but not in my top 3. I think we ordered the wrong things...next time trying the huevos rancheros and the granola. I didn't get the appeal of the restaurant. There's too many other brunch places in the city to try and give my patronage too.
