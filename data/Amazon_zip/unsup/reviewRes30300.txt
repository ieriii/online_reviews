I've eaten at the diner a billion times and have only had one meal I wasn't really into. Some things are a little overpriced but just about everything on the menu is worth trying. My favorite thing ever is the chocolate pumpkin cheesecake that they serve in the fall. I'd kill for a piece of that cheesecake and a cup of chai. It can get crowded on the weekend so be prepared to wait for a bit. The servers are always nice and the food is always good. ETA: People, it's CHOCOLATE PUMPKIN CHEESECAKE season. Get to the diner NOW. But don't eat all the cheesecake, save some for me. ETA, again: I've discovered my favorite Chicago Diner dish - the polenta fiesta! It's ... so ... good.
