Ate here while I was attending a conference in Chicago. Got the Pour Some Sugar on Me wine flight. Enjoyed a cheese plate in addition to my entree. Great food, and our service was great. The room arrangement made it loud and sometimes hard to hear, but I enjoyed catching up with friends. Would be great for a girls night not, not sure about a great date place.
