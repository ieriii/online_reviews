I come here every Monday and Wednesday afternoons now!  I dig their services, their meals, and the decor. As far as food goes, they get the basics right. Although, today's sausage was a bit thin. The fruit seems fresh and the eggs are always done right. Their French Toast was a bit burnt, but nothing to really be a whiner about it.  It happens.  One complaint that i did have was with the cooks.  Well, one of them really. I noticed they tossed plates around pretty much without care.. They do realize that its an open kitchen and everyone can see if you fumble the food to the ground, don't they?  The manager really has to talk to the guys about it. My waitress was a friendly woman, but can use to being a bit more attentive (don't worry, i still tip).  I am not saying wait me like a child, but don't completely forget about me!  Other than that, they have a cool staff.
