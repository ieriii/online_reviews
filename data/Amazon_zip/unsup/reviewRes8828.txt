I enjoy the Noon O Kabob. And Albany Park. Every so often I get a taste for Middle Eastern/Persian food. I don't feel guilty eating it because to me, it's healthy. We started with the hummus, which was tasty, but next time we'll go with the baba ghannouj. I like the complimentary side plate of herbs, feta, and a few veggies. We had the lamb shank and combination plate of ribeye & chicken skewer. The lamb dish was fantastic and if carrots always tasted that good, they would be a staple of my diet. Chicken skewer was also tasty but the ribeye, not so much. Next time we'll probably get a veggie skewer in its place. I'm a big fan of rice so I got the combination of both kinds. Still not sure which one I like better. Our waitress was sweet and kept saying "super," but in a genuine way. I washed everything down with a glass of Hirschbach & Sohne Reisling (from website - moderately sweet with ripe apricot, mango, citrus and a mineral finish). Ahhhhhh, satisfying.
