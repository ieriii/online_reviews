My friends and I make it a point to go to Grand Lux cafe once for dinner and once for dessert every trip we take to Chicago! The best adjective I can think of for this place is; Exciting! The atmosphere is really cozy, artistic, and tastefully designed. The food is even better. My favorite item on the menu is the Chicken Parmesan. It's fresh, simple, tender, and obviously hand-crafted. When it comes to service, I've never been disappointed, and I set my standards very high. I can confidently say that this place has the friendliest, fastest, and most attentive service on Mag Mile. If you go here for dinner, be prepared to wait up to 3 hours, but also be prepared to be amazed with the quality. Perhaps my favorite time to go, is late at night for a quick snack and a dessert that will knock your socks off. Your server will inform you that each dessert is handcrafted and will take 30 minutes to prepare. I've had a sampling of almost all the dessert options, and have not found a flaw in one of them. My favorite, hands down, is the Beignet (sp?). It comes with three house-made dipping sauces that will make you rush back for more.This quality, surprisingly, comes at a very reasonable cost. It's not hard at all to find something under $20 on this menu.
