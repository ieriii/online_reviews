The food was delicious, we had the pho, shrimp beignets, bouillabaisse, filet mignon, & a side of japanese eggplant. All good & the portions were much larger than I expected. I'd give 5 stars but unfortunately part of the dinner was ruined by a crying baby. Our reservations were for 830 so it was pretty ridiculous that a baby was there until 10pm. I would give it a 5+ stars if they had a policy of no kids after 7.
