Terrible Terrible service. I will NEVER stay at this hotel or chain ever again. I travel for work and had airline miles that I used for a room over the Christmas holidays in Chicago. I was charged triple the room price even before we got to the room (incidentals, was thier excuse) even though my stay was already paid upon arrival. Staff were very RUDE and had an attitude that they could have cared less. The pool was out of service and we were told to go across the street and down the block to use the Mariott pool - in the freezing winter. No apologies, no discounts - nothing but bad attitude. I even filed a complain via thier website and I recieved an automatic reply telling me that someone would get in touch with me about my complaint, but I was NEVER contacted. Even when given the chance to make it right, they couldn;t be bothered and obviously do NOT care about thier customers. I am a Hilton Diamond Level Member and have NEVER been treated this badly in any Hilton property. I liked the location but the hotel service was very bad and the hotel could use a facelift. I was most disappointed by the terrible service, lack of pool (which we were not told was out of service when we made the reservation - even though it had been out of service for a while), and out of date interior. I stayed the very next week at the Beverly Hills Hilton and was treated so well - there was utterly no comparison. The Intercontinental neds to take some hospitality lessons from Hilton and learn how to treat thier customers well.
