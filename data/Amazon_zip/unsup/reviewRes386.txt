This is, by some distance, the most memorable meal I've ever had. EVER. I came here in June 2008 with three friends (one of whom miraculously managed to wring us a reservation). The experience lasted four hours, but was touched by pure wondrousness from the moment we began. The service was, in a word, perfect. The decor, while moderately formal, is designed to be comfortable. One absolutely astonishing aspect of Achatz's genius is how he managed to make every aspect of my vegetarian menu look exactly like the original counterpart. Highly highly recommended for one and all. I'll let the other reviewers on here elaborate further.
