An out-of-towner from California, I read the brief opening blurb in Time Out Chicago at my hotel room and called to see if there was space at the bar. When I arrived, I found out there are two "bar" areas, one near the entrance and another four-seater further back in front of the open kitchen where 6-7 guys work their trade. Fortunately the person sitting next to me already was quite familiar with the restaurant, so I got to sample more dishes than I deserved, including a very tasty pot roast with vegetables and a side dish of blackened cauliflower (and I'm not exactly a veggie kind of guy). I also stole a few bites of various desserts and enjoyed the chocolate/coconut truffle thingies the best. Not to mention five different selections from the beer offerings.  Brendan the owner/chef came by to see if I was satisfied, a nice touch. The price was right. And my server came around often enough to refresh my drink and even inquire as to its temperature. I'll be back Thursday night assuming space is available. Macanudo!
