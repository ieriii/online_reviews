I'm not too much of a beer drinker, but I did like the Iron Fist ale I had here (recommended by the ladies at Hairitics across the street). Food was pretty good, I was sort of amped up for the bacon fat popcorn, but in reality it was more like a ton of bacon on top of popcorn (not that I'd ever complain about too much bacon). The one improvement that could be made would be to use more finely shredded or grated cheese so it could melt and coat the popcorn, otherwise your more likely to need a fork to scoop the cheese and bacon and popcorn in your mouth than your fingers. Ok, if that hasn't scared all the healthy eaters away, the burgers are huge, almost Kuma sized. The bun can't take it though, it needs a bit more heft to survive the grease attach. Good food though, very heavy. This place was busy when I stopped in for dinner and survice suffered in speed, but had lunch here once and it was nice and service was faster. Sort a pricey too, but mashed potatoes single handed push this place to four stars, as overall I was wanting to give it a three and a half.
