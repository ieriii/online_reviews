Based on hundreds of reviews I had to check this place out, WOW WOW WOOOOO!!Not sure where that came from sorry. I'm sure it's written in stone somewhere that Thou shall never go to a "great spot" without a reservation or hopes of ever getting seated. Well our prayers were answered when my party of 4 showed up. Friendly service, great food and not to mention the ladies seating at the very end were making my 90 miles experience that more memorable. Thanks for great food and living up to all the expectations I walked in with.Keep up the great work.Oh street parking was a bit of a hiccup and took longer than expected but it gave us a reason to walk further since we ate so much.
