I was, sadly, less than impressed with what I got here. I ordered the Chi Bowl lunch special. It was quit literally white rice, some chicken and green onions with some sauce on the side. BORING. The sauce was indeed good, but I was expecting much more exciting from this place. It was around $8 and came with a pop (or water). A bit steep for a "lunch special." Also, $15 for 10 wings...really?
