Let me start by saying that I had nothing but high hopes for this place and, since seeing it on Check Please, was more than excited to give it try... even ignoring my fiance's face that said "what? we're going where?"  Short story? I should have listened.Long story:The food tasted decent... but that didn't make up for the horrible service and the overpriced short ribs.We ordered the beef and the short ribs... the beef was wonderful... but all we got was a plate of beef with 2 short rib bones on it. No short rib meat. When I confronted the issue with our waitress... she angrily brought over a pair of regular scissors and attempted to cut off a little sliver of something (it wasn't meat) off of the bone. Then said, "Do not eat," and walked away. Being completely baffled by the situation, I assumed the item would be removed from our bill. The bill came and there it was... 18 dollars for 2 bones. I, of course, being who I am, would not sit back and pay for what we got. So I went up to her and inquired. She tried to tell me that the bones were put there for decoration. She tried to say the meat was on the plate with the beef. I'm sorry, I've had short ribs before... there was no short rib meat on my plate of raw meat. It was purely beef. She ended up giving us 10 dollars off, but not before making us argue with her for 20 minutes about the entire situation.Despite the food actually tasting good... I will not return.
