This restaurant was a dream come true! This was my first time in Chicago with some girlfriends and I was expecting nothing but pizza and more pizza.... but when I read about this place I knew I had to go. The restaurant is inside of another building @ 500 Michigan Ave way in the back. This place was hopping so right away you know you are in for a treat. The tables are long and close together and they sit you with strangers but it goes with the whole mood of the restaurant so it works quite nicely.  The inside was pretty packed so they sat us in the outside tent area which was covered and nicely heated so we did not mind. The menu is a little intimidating at first but our waiter was a great help. The food is all small portions and it is meant to be shared. There were four of us and we ordered 8 dishes. Everything is reasonably priced as well and no dish is over about 10 bucks. There was a ton of meat options but I am a pesco vegetarian and even I found food to eat...seafood and cheeses and olives and oooohhhhhhh so delicious. The deviled eggs were unlike any egg I have ever had and I will forever dream of them.  They place is a MUST for a group of friends. It is fun, unique, and an overall amazing dining experience. Order a bottle of wine, a few different dishes, and enjoy.
