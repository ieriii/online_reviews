Starving from waiting in a crazy long line at Lula on a Sunday morning? Swing by RevBrew instead. You'll get seated right away and have a chance to try my favorite breakfast in the city: the Tofu Scramble. Order it and try to not lick the plate. It truly is the best breakfast in Chicago (and this tummy gets around). Light and fresh but also filling; you will feel so energized after eating it. Also- love their beers. A growler of Cross of Gold is my new go-to gift to bring to a house party. RevBrew, you are awesome in my book.
