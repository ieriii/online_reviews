This place is perfect from top to bottom. Great atmosphere, awesome service and the kind of food that makes you make sex faces with every bite. Do yourself a favor and order the barbecue ribs, mac n' cheese and any one of their personal pies (I went with the peanut butter and chocolate). I wish I could just move in there and live in one of the booths. But my constant sex faces might start to creep out the other customers.
