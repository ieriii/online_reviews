After reading all the reviews and hearing the hype, I thought this place would make me give up Moonshine's brunch. NOT!!!!! I walked in and the line was to the door: Understandable! They did not offer us menus, so we had to look at the chalkboard where everything was written. I was hurried to order so I ordered something very basic (eggs & chicken sausage). My girl ordered the French toast with toasted almonds which was delicious. The girl who took my credit card seemed upset when I asked for a copy of the reciept (why wasn't it just given to me). The girl who was seating everyone seemed to have everything in order and was very patient with some of the attitude she was getting from the irritated customers waiting on seating. The fresh OJ was very good and my dish, eventhough very basic, was ok. We had to get our own silverware, napkins and to-go box. I thought it was funny we had to pay before we sat down and got our food. I guess they do that to keep you there and you won't be so fast to leave if they are taking too long to seat you Don't know if I will try this place again. When it comes to brunch on Division, Moonshine still runs the bingo!
