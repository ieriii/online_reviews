The Hopleaf reminds me of some of my favorite taverns in the Pacific Northwest. I would recommend that any Chicago-transplant from Oregon or Washington State visit the Hopleaf for the atmosphere and fantastic beer selection. Try the CB&J with a beer recommended from the staff... the sandwich is a little unusual but very tasty.Also, as a side note, the staff was incredibly gracious to my friends and I the last time I was there. A buddy of mine fainted in the bathroom and the staff helped us take care of him before we brought him to the hospital. I know that's kind of weird story...
