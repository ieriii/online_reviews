The first stop of my "Back from Hawaii" Food Tour is, no doubt about it, Hot Doug's! As soon as I landed at O'Hare Airport after a 9-hour flight, I was starving!  With over 1,000 reviews I'll keep it sweet and simple.  Got there as soon as the place opened at 10:30am on a Friday, and there was already a line forming! I ordered the Chicago Hot Dog and fries fried in duck fat (served Friday and Saturday ONLY)! Delish- reason why I love Chicago so much! I've also tried The Salma Hayek and the Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage with Truffle Aioli. Be adventurous try'em all! Remember to check the website or call in to see if they are open. I've learned my lesson.
