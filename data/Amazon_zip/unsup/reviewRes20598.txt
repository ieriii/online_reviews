Went on a Saturday morning around 10 and the wait was short and the food was pretty decent. I figured this would be another over-hyped eatery due to Rick Bayless' recent resurgence with the top chef win. However I enjoyed it and will definitely be returning. We ordered several dishes as both my roommate and I have eyes bigger than our stomachs! We ordered the following: Poblano-Scrambled Egg Empanada Breakfast Torta: Open-Faced Torta with Poached Egg, Tomato Broth Chorizo-Egg Torta Churros Mexican Vanilla-Sour Cream Coffeecake The only dish I think we could've skipped was the coffeecake. Every thing else was muy delicioso! Sorry I had to :P
