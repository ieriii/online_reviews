Went here for my birthday with a group of girlfriends. I chose this place because, well, it just looked cool, but also because of the location...by the way, the decor is cool, like really cool. We were seated quickly on a Saturday night and got to ordering drinks right away. The Bad News: They are snobs. Everyone decided to drink the table wine because it's cheap and we don't like spending $12 a glass when we are trying to get birthday drunk, give us the cheap stuff and we're happy. Our waitress on the other-hand acted as if this was the fopaux of the century. Memo to Gilt: If you think ordering the table wine ON YOUR MENU, is somehow a bad thing, then remove it. The Good News: Their food is a-maz-ing! I got the mushroom pasta with truffles, mind you this was back in May of '10, and I am still thinking about it!! The Verdict: I would definitely go back, I just hope the staff leaves their 'tude at home.
