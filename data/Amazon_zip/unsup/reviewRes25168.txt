Irazu - everything was great until the food arrived. The oatmeal shake was delicious. The mango shake was good. The service was fast and friendly. But the food .... very disappointing. We went with our server's recommendations. Very mediocre food that seemed overpriced. We'll be back for the shakes just not for the food.
