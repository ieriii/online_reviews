Overall, the experience was dissapointing because the food was not special. I don't care about sitting at picnic tables but can look past such frivolity if the food is outstanding. I read a large number of overwhelmingly positive reviews on this site and apparently this place won best fried chicken in Chicago 2008. So I went there on a Friday night, steady but not too busy. I ordered the Plain Jane, it is their most basic dish. Ordering a basic dish serves as a great indicator to gauge the quality of the ingredients, crappy places disguise low quality and poor execution with sweet or excessively spicy sauces. The chicken arriced after about 10 minutes. It looked crispy and smelled good. However, the flavoring was non-existent and the chicken was saw dust dry. I noticed a million sauces surrounding me but why should I smother my chicken in some insidious sauce to make it taste good? I tried the sauce anyway, tasted good but not what I expected. Beside the chicken is still dry sauce or no sauce. I thought that the plain jane Korean style fried chicken would be oozing with flavor from an infusion of asian spice and delight. Sadly, I received no happy ending from Crisp.
