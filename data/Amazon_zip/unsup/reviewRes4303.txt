Great music and great history here at the Green Mill! I visited one night with my friend from Pennsylvania, wanting to see some live music. The place is killer as far as ambiance and overall feel. It truly does cast a golden age vibe on the patrons. My friend wanted to join in on the live jam, but since he's a blues harp player, they said "strictly jazz, no blues." No problem. We sat for awhile and took the place in. The beer selection isn't great. I think I ended up having Rolling Rock. Maybe I should have had liquor instead. It would have fit the place better I guess.
