I have visited a few times of Sapori Trattoria and always get the Pumpkin Buttersquash Ravioli, a dish they are known for well. First two times, the dish was extraordinary, however the last two times, I didn't think that it was anything great. The taste was more murkiness / blandness than I expected and the pine nuts were overpowering. There is a nice little enclave in the restaurant that if you get with a date or with close friends, it feels like you are in a old rustic home and makes the experience pleasant. I had the sorbet in the summer outside, the coconut one, and it was tasty and presented on a rough coconut skin. It was a nice touch. I probably won't be going to Sapori Trattoria that often, as I can find much better choices/dishes elsewhere in the city. I keep getting their coupon (I put my name in their mailing list a while back) and might try it once again, but its not high on my list. It also doesn't help that its in Lincoln Park and always a tough time with parking.
