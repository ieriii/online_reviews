This one is just for the beer and service. I was driving to the airport one Sunday it dawned upon me that I had time for a beer, and why not Publican (Food TV). It was pretty empty so I just walked in like nobody's business, it wasn't I sat down at the bar that they were closed and setting up for a large private party, but as I was getting up to leave the bartender said I could stay and offered me the beer menu. We engaged in conservation to determine my beer choose because they have so many unique ones on tap and even asked me if I wanted to order some food, even though it was totally obvious they were still prepping and setting-up. The bartender even poured me a sample of the limited edition beer that the private event was meant for. I didn't have the time to sample the food this time but overall, classy. I will be back for the food and more beer one day.
