if the wait time for this place wasnt a standard 4hrs it might get 5 stars lets start off with drinks cause ya theyre awesome...i suggest the blue agave margarita...it will come to u in a teeny martini glass and u will take a moment to think ur gettin jipped but my friends u are not...u-are-not group appetizer platter had some yummy food...i liked the taquitos and empanadas...please dont stone me but i wasnt thrilled with the guac mealtime...steak tacos came with guac and bean soup...coulda passed on the soup it was pretty watery...the steak mix was really great but why give me 5 shells when theres only enough for 2? ps i stole some enchilladas with mole from the bf...my meal wasnt the same after :) i love mexican food and can honestly say ive never had a tortilla like one at the grill...maybe thats how theyre made in the motherland...i wouldnt know...but i wasnt quite diggin the fact that they were really thick and kinda gummy dessert...none...it wouldnt fit...maybe next time where frontera could improve which lets be honest they wont cause rick is so damn popular he could have the city eating out of his hand...and he already pretty much does: -bathrooms...yea i gotta critique the damn things...two stalls with one sink and no standing room? nonono...i did not like this at all i had to wait for 15 min to use one and then had to dance to get to the sink and paper towels and catch a glimpse in the mirror -wait time...ridiculous...take a res its not hard -went here for a surprise bday dinner and they wouldnt seat us till the whole party was here...kinda ruined a bit of the surprise -wait time for drinks...it was a good 15 min into the meal before we got served drinks...i dont mind waiting for food but when it smells that damn good in there please give me something to shove in my mouth NOW -veryyyyyy close tables...i like the homey feel to it...what i didnt like was the fact that i knew i was gonna get bumped anytime someone walked past me dinner lasted about 3 hrs and averaged $80/person with apps/drinks/dinner/tip...more than i was expecting but then again i didnt think the margaritas were gonna taste like nectar from the gods o and the birthday boy got to meet the chef...very cool :)
