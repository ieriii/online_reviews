The food was very good, and you get a lot of it. The menu is big enough to be a little intimidating, especially if you don't have a lot of experience with Indian food.The service was...idiosyncratic, but certainly not terrible-- the waiter took the time to explain things on the menu to us, and make suggestions that ended up being right on.
