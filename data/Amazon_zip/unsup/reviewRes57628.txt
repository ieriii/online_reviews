I've been going here for years! Love everything about it. Dark, great service, and amazing fondue. Very romantic. Actually, the most romantic restaurant that I have ever been to. The food is so fresh and delicious. Worth every penny. It's super classy, but relaxing at the same time. Never had a bad time or meal here! Love it!
