I'm giving it four stars, but that's pushing it. The food was really good. The waitress was very knowledgable. And the bloody mary bar is bomb. Five stars for unlimited shrimp and Absolut Peppar Vodka. But for some reason, I just don't want to go back. Could be the prices, or it might be a specific breakfast dish I despised but can't seem to find on the menu right now. I went for Sunday brunch, and I could have sworn it was pork belly and bonito flake, but maybe it's the Okonomiyaki with bacon. Whatever the protein, I was not a fan of the flavors. The fishiness of the bonito with the overpowering, almost BBQ like, smokiness of the bacon left a not-so-good flavor memory in my mouth. But I have to say the presentation was awesome. The bonito flakes looked alive when the dish was served and the colors were so vibrant. My mom and I also split the Crispy Rice Kobe Beef Roll; it literally melted on my tongue. The warm tenderness of the beef with the salty rice was insanely gratifying. We also ordered the rainbow roll; very fresh, but again, overpriced. I just noticed they have lunch specials and half-priced sushi for happy hour, so I might have to try it again.
