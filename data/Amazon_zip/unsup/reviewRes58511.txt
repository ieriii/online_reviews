While the food is delicious, I found the overall experience unpleasant. After reading on the restaurant's website that reservations were not advised, I decided to arrive without them about 45-minutes prior to dinner service. We were told the wait would be 2 to 2.5-hours. The restaurant was completely empty aside from the bar and waiting area being so packed one could not move through to get to the bathrooms. After walking around the city for 1.5-hours, we were so cold we decided to wait in the crowded waiting area (a few chairs, three I think, next to the entrance and in front of the hostess's desk). There was no room in the bar. After 2.5-hours exactly (the hostess holds you to her original estimate), we were seated. Two of us ordered two entrees and three appetizers. Portions are very small, so this was adequate. The food was very good quality but ordinary Mexico City style food. The kicker was the portions were small and the prices very high. Then, wanting to take a dessert to go, we were told we could not because it would ruin the presentation of the dish. There was no budging on this. All in all, we just felt this is a terrible experience and value. I honestly would prefer my local home town hole in the wall Mexican joint for food that is just as good at very cheap prices from very welcoming staff. I recommend you walk to a better dinner experience even if you are a big Rick Bayless fan like me.
