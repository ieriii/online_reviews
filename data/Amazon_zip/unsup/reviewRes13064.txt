Great atmosphere. Loved the paintings on the walls. It does get loud so if you are planning for a quite night, I would recommend a different spot. The food was average. I had a salad and the coconut shrimp appetizer. The shrimp came with a scoop of curried rice and some sort of sweet sauce which I didn't care for. Conveniently located next to the Brown Line stop.
