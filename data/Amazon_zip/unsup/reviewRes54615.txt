When the guy making my falafel sandwich offered to share an aloe drink with me if I didn't want the giant bottle for myself, I knew I was going to like it at Sultan's. I didn't take him up on it, but a much smaller ginger beer and a filling and delicious sandwich were just as good. I want to live in this neighborhood just so I can go anytime! The cash only part tripped me up (I try not to carry a lot of it because I spend it WAY more easily than when I use my card) but I'll be sure to carry enough for a falafel if I'm in the area. And luckily, it's so cheap that I shouldn't have a problem doing that!
