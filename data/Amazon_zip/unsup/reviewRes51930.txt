Loved this place. I had the classic sausage and cheese deep dish and it was worth the hour wait. Thank goodness for beer! We had some dirty plate issues and our server seem very distracted and almost seemed to forget us at times. The pizza was wonderful though and it was very cool to draw on the wall at famous Gino's East!
