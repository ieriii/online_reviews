I really like going to Greek Islands with my girlfriends. The waiters are so nice and make you feel like models every time we go. It is usually very crowded, so if you don't have a reservation you may have to wait a while before getting seated. The food is good we usually get the family meals so we get a little of everything. What I look forward to eating the most is the Taramosalata. It is the best!!! It is a Pink spread a blend of cod roe, potatoes, onions and olive oil. I spread it on the bread and it taste delicious. I usually call it the pink stuff because I cant pronounce Taramosalata.
