One star since my wife loved here Weisswurst brunch. I got the Chorizo with eggs for brunch. What a waste of money - the tiniest portions, inhale and it's gone. The manager apologized strongly, but why not just serve the right meal at the right portion at the right price the first time. it reminds me of a big munich beer hall - no atmosphere, not good for any type of dates but definitely the beer crowd (the ones who have enough cash to blow) that likes to yell over the other voices. Not a pick.
