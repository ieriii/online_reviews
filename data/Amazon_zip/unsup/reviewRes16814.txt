Fun atmosphere, great drinks (mojitos!) and appetizers (the ceviche sampler is great.) I wanted to try the guacamole (as the waiter said it is made as orders come in) but unfortunately someone we were with didn't want it, so I will have to go back to try it. Excellent service. An overall really great experience.
