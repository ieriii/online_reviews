When your wife surprises you with a dinner at the Publican and the beer cicerone is your chef. You best get 5 star service. I dined at the Publican for my birthday this year, and had also just gotten bitten by the home brewing bug, so my wife made my head exlplode with this dinner. Chris had planned the entire dinner around 8 beers that he wanted us to try, so not only did I get to try some beer that would have been of my radar, someone else chose the food that was great to go with it.  Our fist course started out with the Pork Rinds and Goose Island Sophie. Second course was then Charcuterie paired with a Fladers Red sour and Saison Dupont. Third course was Allagash Cureiux with suckling pig for me and a nice salmon for my wife. We then were treated to a beer that I couldn't remember at this point, more of a champagne yeast use to clean the palate. Then a plethera of their desserts combined with a coffee stout from somewhere out east. All in all a great meal, great company and fantastic waiter!!!
