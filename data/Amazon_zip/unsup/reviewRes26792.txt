A good night out. Helpful info: cash only, ATM on premises, BYOB, prime dinner time is crowded, pay to park (street) On the positive + + Inexpensive as good ol' Mexican food should be + You get a free appetizer with your chips...our night was a taquito + great tacos, chorizo beans, enchiladas Room for Improvement - - red salsa is watery and not as flavorful - Tres Leches cake is not good. :( Our new spot in Pilsen. Very, very good.
