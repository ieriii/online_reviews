I was very impressed with the quality of Sushi X. The dinning area only has room for maybe 15 -20 people, so you might have to wait a bit if they are crowded. They also have Anime playing on one of the walls. I did not try any of the traditional sushi rolls and went with the more exotic rolls like the Buddha and the Crab Rangoon Roll. They are very large rolls, and I was not able to finish it. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a laid back sushi place to chill at.
