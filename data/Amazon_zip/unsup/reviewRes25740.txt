Seeing 4 stars on Yelp, I thought this place was a safe bet for good Vietnamese food. Good being authentic. I was too hungry to read the reviews, and I paid a physically painful price after the meal. I ordered pho with beef balls. The broth's lack of flavour was compensated by salt and pepper. Noodles were almost glass noodle thin. Beef balls were cut in half, as if for convenience...and authentic restaurants rarely sacrifice quality for convenience.
