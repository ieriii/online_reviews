Best Cafe Con Leche I've ever had. I lived in Key West and got hooked on this morning tradition. Great food and atmosphere. Welcome to the neighborhood! Great addition to the neighborhood. UPDATE: I'd really like to see them do something about the horrible excuse for Mojito mix they are using. I get that it's BYOB and that even offering a mix is a bonus and true muddled sugar and mint leaves is not likely, but the blended "chopped" mint mix is terrible.
