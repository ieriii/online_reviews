Never go during peak time on a cold day (Saturday 8p). You will be trapped in a very small waiting area. I ordered the nacho appetizer (loved it), the bbq "bacon" cheeseburger (pretty good saucy mush) bbq "wings" (not so good texture not able to bite in some parts but good sauce), sampled the mac and cheese (very tasty and "cheesy"), and the chocolate chip cheese cake (yummmmmmmm!) The staff was attentive and I thought the prices were reasonable. 1 appetizer, 1 soda, 2 burgers with a side, and 1 dessert just under 50 bucks. I'm new to veganism and glad there is someplace to go when I'm looking for good bar/diner food. I will go back and try some of the other dishes.
