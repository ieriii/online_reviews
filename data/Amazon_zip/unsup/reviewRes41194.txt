My hubby and i couldn't help but re-visit Ruth's Chris for Restaurant Week since we had such a good experience at last year's Restaurant Week. I pretty much ordered exactly the same thing I did last year and have two words to describe my experience: Quality Yummy! This Restaurant Week deal is TOTALLY worth it. I had just as good of a meal as i remembered. The Filet Mignon is totally the standout dish here and both times they cooked it medium rare to perfection. I like to sometimes swirl the steak in the butter on the plate because it makes it taste even more amazing!!! My husband's Ribeye was also really good - i've had bad ribeye before and they do SUCH as a good job - seasoned well, very juicy, well peppered. It tasted yummy even though he ordered it medium, rather than my preference of medium rare. Good for taste buds that don't care for the tenderness of filet mignon and want juicy flavorful steak. Still loved the Steak House Salad (love the balsamic Vinagrette) while my hubby ordered the Seafood Gumbo which was good but nothing standout. One negative thing I noticed this time was that my glass of red wine was served a bit warm. It's kind of a turnoff when restaurants do hat. hopefully they will temperature their red wines better in the future. Chocolate mousse was just ok.
