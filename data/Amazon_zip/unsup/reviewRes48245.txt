Brunch it up, Peeps!  If your need for pork products trickles into brunch territory, you should most definitely be looking at The Publican for your brunching needs. A menu heavy on the pork, seafood and generally fried products, it's a caloriefest that's sure to please your palette. The best bang for you buck will be the delightful Ham & Eggs served with polenta, fried egg & truffle chow chow. It's seriously a pound of freaking ham. Definitely enough to satiate the hungriest of bellies. Maybe you're feeling simple? Try the frites with fried eggs. Mmm... glorious. Yes, they take reservations for brunch and yes, you should make them. This place is constantly bumping due to the extreme popularity of Paul Kahan... and his Michelin Bib Gourmand award probably doesn't hurt, either. Brunch win.
