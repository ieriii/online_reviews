One of the places I insist people form out of town visit when coming to Chicago. Some of the best in house beer and artisan pizza the city has to offer combined in the same place. Native Chicagoans tend to cling to the gut bomb that is Chicago deep dish. The motz of deep dish is best used as bathroom sealant. If I'm going to fill my belly I'd rather go half full with tasty malty beverages and half with good flaky crust pizza from Piece.  My only criticism is the same as many other reviewers. The place has been "discovered". Much like your favorite places that gain rapid mass popularity via the food network, travel channel, or simply word of mouth, be prepared to wait 1-2hrs during peak weekend hours.
