Frankly, I think this place deserves a 6th star. From the smiling hostess, to the knowledgeable and attentive wait staff, to the unbelievable food, Kinzie Chop House never ceases to impress. I might as well dive right into the descriptions of the food. We started off with mussels in a garlic butter white wine with tomato-chunks pool of heaven. They were perfectly done...and the broth was so incredible we soaked the rest of our bread basket in it after the mussels were gone. We could not get enough. Then came a wedge salad that we said we'd split...lo and behold, they brought it out on two individual plates for us. The ranch dressing is some of the best I've ever had. If they sold it in stores I'd be broke and chubby because I'd eat it like soup. The steaks, served a la carte, came soon after. They were perfectly crusted and cooked. I highly recommend getting ALL of the dipping sauces. They are FREE! and so worth trying. The mushroom medley and asparagus with hollandaise were a perfect pairing with the meal. The sides are very reasonably priced for the amount of food in each serving. Honestly, we didn't even miss the starch.  If I was rich, I would eat here as much as possible. I've never been disappointed. You should go. I am obsessed.
