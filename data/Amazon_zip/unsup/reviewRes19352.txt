Returned to Coast this past weekend on Saturday night. Just as good as my first experience. Only difference was I had a reservation for 930, which I was thankful for (place was packed). Literally sat us 8 min late. I did not complain to a soul that we were seated a couple minutes late. Honestly, it wasn't a big deal to me whatsoever. At the table we were visited by a manager unexpectedly and offered a discount on our current meal or I could save it for another time. Just confirms with me that they care about their customers and reputation.
