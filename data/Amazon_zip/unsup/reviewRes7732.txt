So I had a review on Fogo earlier in the day, however, when I tried to post Yelp wasn't letting me. It was a grandeur review too. I can't remember a thing I wrote except..."delectable meats", "Churrascaria", "salad bar", "delicious", "price is worthwhile", etc. By the looks of my short descriptions I think you get the idea. Oh yeah, one more thing, the temperature of how the meats are cooked are always on-point. That's a major plus with me and definitely a lot of people that I know who enjoy their steaks a medium style temperature. Fogo De Chao is comparable to none. *thumbs up
