Me and my wife made reservations for Valentine's Day on the day of. We knew that they had a dinner special because it was on their website, but they failed to mention on the website that the special would be the only meal they would be serving that day. I guess they notified other people who made their reservations earlier than the day of. We could have left, but we thought we would give it a try. We were somewhat disappointed in the Valentine Day special (especially considering that it cost $69/person). The food was decent, nothing really note worthy and portions tiny. The service was very good with an very attentive staff. All in all, it might have been a better experience with the regular menu.
