The food was great. We had a reservation at 7:00 on the Saturday of Valentine's Day weekend, so we expected a little bit of a wait. The restaurant has no place to stand and wait to be seated. The host stand seemed really disorganized. There were lots of open tables and a lot of people waiting by the door to be seated. We were really close to the tables of other people eating. I felt badly being so close to them. That is the only negative. The food is great and the portions are huge. On a less-busy night it would probably be perfect.
