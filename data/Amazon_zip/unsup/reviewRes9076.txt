I came here with my father because he had heard favorable things about Noon o Kabab. We ordered two appetizers and an entree to split. The first appetizer was Kash-Ke-Bademjan, a mix of eggplant, mint, and onion. It was quite tasty, and an excellent alternative to baba gannouj, which I generally can't stand because of the tahini. We then got button mushrooms drizzled in a pomegranate reduction which was very interesting, but also enjoyable. I'd never had pomegranate reduction before, and it was sweeter than I anticipated but it worked really well with the mushrooms. The entree we ordered was called Adass Polo. It's a mix of lentils, raisins, saffron rice, and carmelized onion over basmati rice. It was nicely seasoned but very dry. The lentils especially, as some of them were almost crunchy. Perhaps if it had been more brothy over the rice it would have meshed better. The service was more than adequate and there are some beautiful tiles on the walls. I don't think I'd go back as I've had better middle-eastern food in Chicago, but it certainly wasn't a bad experience.
