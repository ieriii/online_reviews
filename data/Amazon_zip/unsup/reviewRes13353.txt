I feel in love with this place tonight. I'm from California and visiting a bud here in Chi., and we choose this spot based on the fresh healthy fish offering mixed with a bit of Louisiana flair. (Warning! I came hungry!) The Food Is Excellent! We started with the clam chowder, I believe the best I have ever had. Then we got a healthy scoop of smoked trout dip for our crackers; adding a little hot sauce to that, and BAM! you are in a smoked trout pudding Heaven. Then came my Jambalaya , with incredible fresh shrimp, crawdads, and tasty succulent spicy sausage in a sweat and spicy sauce covering delicious skillet fried cornbread, did I mention CORNBREAD.        By this point I have entered a world where restaurants CAN take care you with incredible food, flavors and sizable portions. As I wipe tears of joy away from my face I have to maneuver quickly to shovel more of those sweet & spicy jumbo shrimps in my mouth. Mmmmm. The night was not over and I had to reach peak ecstasy and have a piece of Key Lime Pie. Of course, IT WAS REAL, real BIG and really awesome! I'm home now enjoying a cigarette and will look forward to my next visit to Chicago and heading over to Glenn's for some fine cookin. Cheers. J
