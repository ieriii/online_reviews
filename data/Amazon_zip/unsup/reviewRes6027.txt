It's sad when my most memorable experience with a restaurant is the fact that they charge $7 corkage for wine that you actually bought off their wine list! This is a misleading, albeit clever, marketing ploy that allows them to price their wine bottles lower on the actual wine list. Then your check comes and voila, there is the $7 corkage fee per bottle! There was nothing wrong with the food. It was also nothing to write home about. Simply put, I find the place overrated. We had a variety of dishes - from the pork belly to the mason jars to pizzas and steak. The carbonara risotto also gets special mention here. The heat from the risotto does not fully cook the raw egg they put on it so unless you want to feel Hurricane Katrina inside your stomach, I say steer clear of this dish. Still, if you must eat here, stick to the mason jars and boards. Those I would recommend. Beyond that, I wouldn't recommend that you make this a destination.
