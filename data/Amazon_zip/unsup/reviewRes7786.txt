If you want to OD on meat, this is the best place to do it. Excellent cuts of wonderful meat, properly prepared. These Brazilian meat-fest restaurants continue to do well, and for good reason. At Fogo, the salad bar is good, the service is great, the dcor is irrelevant, and the meat just keeps coming and coming. Yelpers seem to rate Fogo as the best of the breed in Chicago and I agree. My favorites were the perfect filet mignon, the melt-in-your-mouth lamb chops, and the Parmesan-encrusted pork. I see from their website that the lamb in imported from New Zealand - interesting, because I've only had lamb that good before when it's been from New Zealand at events sponsored by the New Zealand government. If you go, be sure to try the lamb chops, they're a treat unmatched. Also the "house-special" sirloin was very good too. You have to take control of the servers, or you'll have too much of items you don't want. Just plan to say no until you're really convinced the item being offered is exactly what you want. You'll still have way too much meat. I tried maybe six different meats and turned down another seven or eight. If they slice a piece of meat for you that's not cooked the way you want it, they'll unhesitatingly take it back and cut you one more to your liking. And be careful asking for rare - they do know how to bring out really rare meat, the kind people at the table will cover their eyes when they're carving off a piece. Service was downright excellent. Not only efficient, but prompt, attentive, and friendly. The salad items are good, and so are the desserts. But they're all secondary. This is not fine dining. You're not here for a five course meal, or a 30-course sampling with wine parings. This is an overindulgence of awesome meats. Properly grilled. And wonderfully served. Until you ache and have to turn your card to red. Carnivores rule!
