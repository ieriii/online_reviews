I came here with some pretty high expectations. I am no sushi connoisseur -- but having been exposed to Tampopo as my first sushi joint, the rolls at Sushi X CANNOT compare. I challenge anyone who lives in the Northside to go to Tampopo and see how MASSIVE the rolls are. I must admit, however, that Sushi X has more offerings for people like me who do not eat seafood. I had the Pollo Loco roll and at first, it was fine. Then, I tasted a hint of buffalo sauce or something and that threw it off for me. The sweet potato roll was really skimpy and was not filling. I felt REALLY raped after I left Sushi X. We spent double the money here and left with a far from full stomach. Needless to say, I might not come back here.
