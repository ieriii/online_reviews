I'm broken... Well, my foot that is. It sucks not being able to walk around and not being able to stand in the kitchen and cook a decent meal! That's where Irazu comes in. They deliver!! The other night I ordered a wonderful meal from Irazu. I ordered the fried yuca and the empanadas to start. I was not impressed with the chicken or the plantain empanada, but the beef and potato? YUM! All three were perfectly crispy when they were delivered and had a nice filling to crust ratio but the beef and potatoes had a wonderful flavor to them that the other two lacked. They were ok, but not up to par for a Miami transplant. The yuca was crispy as well and came with a great garlicky mojo. It's not a myth! Delivered food can remain crispy!  For dinner I had the pork chops. They were moist and tender with perfectly grilled onions on top. It's nice that they include a salad which I didn't eat of course. I filled up on the yummy sweet plantains, rice and beans. I was expecting beans but it was more of a been puree. At first I was a bit disappointed but after I tried them, I forgot all that. They were so good!  Next time I want take out and don't want the standard pizza or Chinese, Irazu will be my go to place. I can't wait to try even more things on the menu!
