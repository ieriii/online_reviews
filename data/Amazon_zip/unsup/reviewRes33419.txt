Love private parties in the upstairs space at Mia Francesca - the family style service totally works, you have your own private bar, and you can essentially set up your party any way you want. But the main dining room experience leaves something to be desired. The seating is incredibly tight and cramped, and it feels like you're either on top of other diners or the wait staff is on top of you. Even if you have a reservation, you typically have to wait a few minutes to be seated and there's seriously nowhere to wait inside the door. Service is mediocre at best, and the food is hit or miss given how often the menu changes. I've had some seriously delicious dishes here, but I've also had plenty of pastas that just aren't worth finishing. I've also had friends get food poisoning after dining here more than once. All in all, I'd recommend the Bryn Mawr location over this one. The service is significantly better and the food is usually much better as well.
