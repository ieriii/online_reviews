My husband and I stopped here for breakfast while running errands and were expecting greatness based on the Yelp reviews. Sadly, we were really let down! The omelette I had was bland and the veggies promised inside were few. The strange thing is that the omelette came with a salad? My husband had french toast which was good, but not nearly worth the cost. We wanted to get coffee, but not at $4 a cup! This place is way overpriced and the breakfast/brunch menu is extremely limited.
