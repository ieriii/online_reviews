We went to Tru for my sister in laws birthday. What an experience. This was one of my first experiences at dining in a restaurant of this caliber. Since going to tru, I have also been to alinea, and comparing the two, i would say food wise, tru comes out ahead. While alinea is amazing in its own right, the concept of the restaurant is just different. Tru is all about a great meal, no theatrics. Everything is very calculated at tru, If I had any advice, it would be to get as many courses as you could, because who knows when you will be back. The entire evening was very memorable, from the synchronized water pouring to the synchronized serving for the entire table. This would be difficult to appreciate in a smaller group, so I would suggest going with 5-6 people.
