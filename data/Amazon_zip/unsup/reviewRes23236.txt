By far my favorite repeat Chicago -no all of America- greek eatery. This place is wonderful and fun. It takes a while to eat there and isn't cheap if you've got your appetite on, but the food is delicious! From the flaming greek cheese appetizer (complete w/ waiter presentation) to their Mediterranean sea dinner, it's great greek. My favorite is their grilled baby octupus -to die for. Only in Greece can you get better execution. TT
