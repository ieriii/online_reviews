the macarons are really not good. i don't think they even use almond flour. i will say, though, that the buttercream in the chocolate one was really good. but after spending $20 on those cookies, you would think more than just the buttercream would be good. this was the first time i've been here - passed by during do division - and it was really really busy, so it must be good. i'd give it another go - all these positive reviews can't be wrong. i just know i won't be trying the macarons again.
