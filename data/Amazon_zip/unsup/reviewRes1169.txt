REASON 1: Foie gras and sauternes duck sausage with truffle aioli, foie gras mousse, and sel gris. REASON 2: Fresh cut potatoes rendered in duck fat. Shortest review I'll ever write, because if those two things above don't give you enough of a reason to wait in line for an hour or two, then I really can't help you. Seriously. Duck sausage hot dog topped with foie gras + duck fat fries. Your gall bladder will hate you, but your taste buds will call you God. Amen.
