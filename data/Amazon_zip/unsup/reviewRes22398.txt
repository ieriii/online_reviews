After driving around in circles several times for parking, we finally decided on eating the cost and parking in the lot. When we arrived, there were several groups waiting outside in 35 degree weather. Everyone was here for the same reason - to dine at the highly publicized and notorious Lao Sze Chuan. This place is infamous as seen by the many awards and media coverage it has received shown at the front window of the restaurant. Business has been going well since they expanded to the second floor and renovated the interior and exterior of the space. I remember the food being excellent when it first opened but is it just as good now that I have to wait an hour before being seated? We ordered the shrimp in mayonnaise sauce, noodles Peking style, and curry chicken. The shrimp is outstanding and as good as I remembered it. It's definitely a must have. At other places, it's normally dense and you feel like you just ate spoonfuls of mayonnaise. At Lao Sze Chuan, it's more refined where the batter and sauce are light with a citrus aftertaste. I come specifically for this dish even though they specialize in Szechuan cuisine. Lao Sze Chuan is still worth all of the hype but the wait is aggravating for dining in Chinatown. It's bad enough that you have to fight for parking and the food takes some time to come out. For city folk, take the Red Line to avoid parking expenses. For drivers, avoid peak times to save your sanity. Since they are open until 2:30am, I would definitely come back again but maybe try off times to avoid the crowds.
