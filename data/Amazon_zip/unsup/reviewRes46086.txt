Yeah, it's not the best restaurant in the city, but it's fun, it's comfy, it's not *totally* overpriced and the food is pretty darned good. I particularly enjoy eating here during the day, when the sun provides a great deal of the ambient light in the dining room and when the lines aren't out the door. And how can I review this place without mentioning their fabulous cookies?! Holy cow. If you like peanut butter, you will LOVE the Grand Lux peanut butter cookies: They're two thin, chewy cookies held together by a layer of creamy peanut butter. Stop by the takeout dessert counter on the second floor and get yourself a few; if you only get one, you'll end up having to go back!
