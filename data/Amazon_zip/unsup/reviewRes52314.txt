Eh, I suppose if you're visiting Chicago for the first time you should try it. If you don't like deep dish pizza, don't bother coming. This location is fine, you can draw on the walls and everything. The one great thing about Gino's is their breadsticks. They're soft and flavorful and come with a dipping sauce. I'd go back for just the breadsticks.
