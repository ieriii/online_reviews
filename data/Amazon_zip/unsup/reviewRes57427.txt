I only take the time to write a review when a place either amazes me or ticks me off ... you know how it goes.This place amazes me!! The food is ridiculously authentic. Great great service. A great value and beautiful atmosphere. Usually Mexican restaurants leave much to be desired when it comes to decor and cleanliness unfortunately, but The Palace (I like to call it) does not. It is so so clean and the decor is very cool and appropriate.If you like Mole' or even if you don't this is the place to try it. MMmmmm. Just like it should be made .. finally! The Margaritas are stupid good and the simple lime is my favorite. Why complicate a good thing? Really, I travel to Mexico and lived in New Mexico - these are authentic drinks.The service can be a bit shy, probably due to some language barriers but they get it. They understand the steps of service (check back questions / refills / clearing plates) and really that is hard to find. But not here. We like to ask for Augustine, Burto, Flur, and Venessa behind the bar rocks too. Forgive me if the names are bit off. The entire staff is great. You will see lots of them stopping by to check on you as their teamwork is perfect.Also, when it is warm, be sure to visit their newly remodeled outdoor patio. Are you kidding me? It is so amazing you won't believe where you are. And the little hallway leading you back to it makes you feel like you are really in Mexico.Tips:Go there!
