So I had this place for the first time last night for dinner. My girlfriend and I ordered a pizza for delivery. It arrived fairly quick, definitely ahead of schedule, which was good but when I opened the door the box literally had grease on about 1/3 of it. The delivery driver apologized and said I don't know what happened. Of course when I opened the box half the cheese slid off and was covered in grease. Maybe I had a bad pizza or who knows but it was a bad experience to say the least. Sorry, but not a fan.
