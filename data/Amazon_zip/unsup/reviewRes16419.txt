My, how you've grown up, VH! But, sadly you have picked up a few bad habits in your old age, which have upset me:  1. The service is slow. The last couple of times I have been, we have waited too long for drinks or the check. 2. I went on a Saturday night around 10pm and stood in line as several other groups of seemingly cooler people skipped to the front of the line and were let in. Is this really "first come, first served"? I liked you a lot more a year ago when the pretense was turned down a notch.
