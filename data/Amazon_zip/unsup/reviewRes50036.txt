This place has delicious steaks. Selective about meat, I have no qualms about ordering a steak here because I feel it's high quality.  Not to mention, it's delicious--no A1 needed! The marinade on the steak is perfect! The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I wish they had more options for side dishes.  Most dishes come with potatoes and plantains or beans. Delicious as they are...more options would be nice! You can't beat that this place is BYOB but also has a full bar. Keep in mind there is an $8 corkage fee for bringing your own. The drinks from their bar are strong! Just they way they should be!
