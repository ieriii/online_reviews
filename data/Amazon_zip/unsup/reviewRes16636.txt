I went to this place last December, as a date to a friend's company Christmas party. Sweet merciful crap this place is awesome. The bar are is darker, but intensely colorful, with leafy plants all over and muted music with lots of horns. The main dining area is huge. The ceiling is easily 40' high and the walls are adorned with huge mirrors and big stripes of bright colors. The chairs and floors and private dining areas are similarly themed; and the lighting is bright enough that you have no problem reading your menu, but dim enough to make it intimate, even in the huge space. Plus, even though we were all seated at a 10' round table, I had no problem hearing those around and across from me. Food-wise? I had these short-ribs and while it definitely looked like barf (brown meat with brown sauce with corn and peanut salsa - the plating needed a little help), it tasted like heaven, and was so tender that it all but cut itself. The appetizer plate of Ceviches was pretty awesome as well, especially the scallops and the tuna. Go, the atmosphere is awesome and the food is phenomenal. Just make sure someone else is paying. ;-)
