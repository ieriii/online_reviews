Came to Chicago on vacation for Labor Day and wanted to go some place close to the hotel we were staying in with a rooftop patio. I Yelped for a good bar in the area and found Zed451. This place is trendy and super cute. Apparently there is a restaurant downstairs. I didn't eat a meal but there was a pretty solid wait. But we went to the rooftop and grabbed a seat. The waitress was attentive, the drinks (although a little pricey) were AMAZINGLY good and I HATE the taste of alcohol so that says a lot! The little finger foods were great too! There really wasn't a view but the atmosphere, drinks, food, and music made it worthwhile.
