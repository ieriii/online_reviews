More traditional (and slightly more expensive) fondue than Melting Pot. They have wine maker dinners which are a good value. The tables can be really cramped though, so try to make sure you get a booth. Since it's not a restaurant you'd want to dine at all the time, once you register your birthday/(fake) anniversary and what not with them, wait for them to send you the $25-50 off coupons before you go. Or check their website for the winemaker dinners as you can usually drink your money's worth on that end alone! Corkage I believe is $25. Another negative is on weekends they don't take reservations. Overall a good restaurant, and while it may be sacrilegious to say so, my ex-gf and I both preferred Melting Pot overall, but this made for a nice change of pace.
