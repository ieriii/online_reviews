We went on a Wednesday night around 6:30 and by the time we left at just after 8 the place was packed. We were greeted by a very friendly staff and the service was great. The food was fabulous and the portion sizes were great, especially for the price (mine was about 12 bucks). My first foray into real Costa Rican cuisine and I'll definitely be back for more. BYOB, inexpensive, great food, friendly staff and atmosphere.
