I love me some SUPERDAWG. It's a must that I go there everytime I'm back home in Chicago. My favorite hot dogs hands down. I live in Los Angeles and have had Pinks, which in my opinion is greatly overrated. To stand in line that long for a hot dog is just ludicrous.  Grab a Superdawg with a Vanilla milk shake and you'll be in heaven.
