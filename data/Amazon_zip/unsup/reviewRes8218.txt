Brazilian Steak House that never disappoints my hungry tummy. If you want amazing selections of grilled meat, go to Fogo de Chao. I do love meat more then "healthy" food but I can't walk away from their amazing salad bar. Service is excellent, food is abundant and wines are descent. It is a great place for larger group (6-8). Good job Fogo de Chao.
