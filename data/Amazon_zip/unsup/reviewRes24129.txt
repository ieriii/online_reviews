Algerian coffee/ tea shop with awesome crepes with a North African flair. This is really as good as it gets. If you are expecting more traditional French crepes (the usual complete" or stuffed crepes with bechamel sauce and wine), this place is not for you. Now if you are willing to experience the crepe concept with more North African flavors and ingredients, you came to the right place, you won't be disappointed and I guarantee you'll be back. The experience starts upon entering: nice decoration with shiny copper on the walls, a lot of mirrors, smell of mint, friendly smiles from the staff, all reminescent of Algiers or maybe Marakkesh. Right there you are already transposed to a different part of the world. Now the food and drinks, well I'm a sucker for mint tea and this one is really good so I would start there. The crepes, well all great with interesting and well balanced flavor combinations. The salty ones are served with a rather big cup of soup. I had the vegetables puree and it felt freshly made. For the crepes, I would start with the Icosium or the Marrakesh which again combine typical North African ingredients like raisins, pine nuts, tapenades and result in well balanced great tasting crepes. If you feel adventurous, add a serving of Merguez to your crepes (spicy lamb sausage), they are authentic and will come with the usual Harissa (spicy paste) on the side for an even more authentic experience. Hope you save space for dessert because the dessert crepes are certainly worth indulging. Here you can go the traditional French way: nutella/banana, Belgian chocolate/banana.... or again if you feel like trying something more exciting, go for the ones with more North African ingredients in which case the Icosium dessert crepe is a good place to start: fruit compote counterbalanced with rose petal water, simple yet out of this world. I think I'm salivating again just writing this review.
