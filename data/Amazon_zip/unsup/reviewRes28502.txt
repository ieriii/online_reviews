Came here for dinner with my brother and a friend based on Yelp reviews (I mean, how else does one pick a restaurant?). It's a pretty casual place and although it's in a pretty busy area, we were able to find some free parking. Lots of your typical pasta options, all at very reasonable prices. I'm a big fan of bruschetta, so ordered that as an appetizer for the three of us. It was pretty mediocre and the bread looked burnt. Not such a great start to the meal...don't order it. The pasta was good for what we paid for it. I wouldn't come back here though. I know that I am capable of making better pasta at home and there are better places to go if you are looking for creative pasta. If you're in a bind for dinner and really want pasta, I would stop by here, but otherwise, boil some up on your own. You'll thank yourself later.
