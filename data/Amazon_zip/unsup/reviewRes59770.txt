The worst. We didn't get to try the pizza. We ordered pizza for delivery & they said under an hour. 90 minutes later, we called and they were so rude on the phone. I asked to speak the manager and they said no and then hung up on me. My husband called and he was able to talk to the manager - and the manager could have cared less. Rude.
