Stepped in for dessert after having brunch next door at Frontera Grill on Saturday. Lucky/unlucky for me, the bf refused to share the churros with me, claiming he was too full. So here I am, a 95 pound little Asian girl, faced with the challenge of scarfing down 3 surprisingly large churros and chocolate dipping sauce all on my own (after just having a very satisfying brunch). Um, I don't think there is a pretty way to put this. But I won. -- The churros were fucking amazing. Totally worth the calories. Totally put the thousands of churros from Disneyland and Costco I ate growing up to shame. -- I was extremely saddened by the fact that Xoco isn't open on Sundays and Mondays. Extremely saddened. Because I would have liked nothing more than to come back again for those churros. And maybe a torta, a bowl of caldos, and some of that Mexican vanilla soft serve.
