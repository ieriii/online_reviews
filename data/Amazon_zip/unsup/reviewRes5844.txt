Same 4.5 Stars, but no toward 4. This is still one of the go to place around the area, and they have good menu. However, I think the food is a little bit too salty to my appetite. Next time I will ask them if they could add less salt to our food. (This is totally my own opinion. It may not be that salty to other people).
