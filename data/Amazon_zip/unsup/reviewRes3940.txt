The food here has really gone downhill. The Buddha Bowl usually get was pretty awful. The rice was barely lukewarm, perhaps they hadn't microwaved it long enough. Even the egg on top was cold. They'd obviously pre-cooked it and didn't even bother to rewarm it. I felt like the whole dish was an assemblage of leftovers. Bleh.
