I went to superdawg for the first time just a few days ago and was very suprised. This place is probably the last drive-in joints in chicago. The hot dogs are served in nice little boxes that act as a couch for hot dogs. Their dogs are homemade and covered in all the fixings, And how can forget the tarzan and jane hot dog statues on the roof.
