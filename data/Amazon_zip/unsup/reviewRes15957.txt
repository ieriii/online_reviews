Maybe it was an off night, maybe it was just our server, it was something!  We have been here before and I have been here before with my girlfriends and it seems like it was better before. The place is beautiful and quite different than many restaurants in the city. Multicolored walls, lanterns hung from the ceiling, the name Carnivale goes well with how they decorated the restaurant. Anyhow, I will rate by Service, Food, Drinks and Ambiance. Service: 1 Star If you get a server named Jessica, who looks like a thick Mexican Pinup girl you should refuse to be serviced by her. From the time the hostess gave us our table to getting a drink, an appetizer, main entree, etc, there were 20 minute or so intervals. We arrived at 8 left at 11:00. Everything seemed to take forever, I understand she was taking care of several large tables, but if she couldn't handle a two person table we should've been given a different hostess. I tried to give her the benefit of the doubt, but when I would see people who arrived later than us getting their drinks, appetizers or entrees before us I was getting quite annoyed. Food: We had the Churassco, she advised it was huge and it could be shared, it was not big at all, portions were small and minimal compared to other places. Steak was juicy, prepared medium to perfection. If it was bigger I'd be more satisfied. The ceviche- Halibut, Mixto and another one that I can't remember the name was again small & bland. If you want ceviche, this is not the place. Go to Nacional 27 and try the Ceviche Nachos.  Drinks: Watered down, the capirinhas were watered down with sprite, when it should only be made with cachaca, limes and muddled sugar. Ambiance Nice, the place is beautiful, different, lively, cute, charming, and what we loved that it wasn't a cookie cutter restaurant that didn't try to live up to other restaurants.
