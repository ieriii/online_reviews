I am shocked. SHOCKED this place has positive reviews... though in a way not. It seemed like everyone there was a repeat customer who knew the staff by name.... However, I am not sure exactly why. Everyone there was white, btw. This may seem silly, but I don't trust a Mexican place in the city that cannot attract a single Mexican. I got there and after a couple minutes, they brought me an ordered sangria (WAY overpriced) tons of ice, tasting of vinegar, no fruit then.... I sat, menu closed, for 13 minutes while the staff (more staff than customers) talked LOUDLY. So loudly it was disturbing. When the waiter FINALLY Comes over I inform him I am ready to order and he says "Already?" like he can play some Jedi mind trick and make me think I was not already there 20 minutes.  I order combination #3; Cheese enchilada, veggie taco, chile rellano. First of all, the veggie taco was all barely warm green peppers and onions with a scant scattering of cheese and a light dollop of sour cream. Not terrible, just bland and disappointing. The rest was so salty I thought I would die of hypertension right there. This was ridiculous. I live in a neighborhood with a ton of great Mexican food; this is not even decent Mexican food. I swear they oversalt so you drink a lot. They asked me if I wanted a drink about eight more times. The enchilada sauce was VERY salty AND sugary, like a BBQ sauce with taco seasoning. It was also cold. Beans and rice were so salty they had no other flavor. The chile rellano had some sort of sauce on it that tasted just like Ragu brand sauce with some onions (and salt) mixed in. Just awful. This is easily the worst Mexican I have ever had; I ate better in both Fargo North Dakota and middle of nowhere Northern Minnesota. What was good? The mango margarita. I cannot think of a reason to touch their actual feed.  Two stars b.. actually, screw it. One star. It was not cheap either.
