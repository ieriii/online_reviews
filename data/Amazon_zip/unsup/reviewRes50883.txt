I would 've given it four stars but after my first visit it wasn't as good!  As the food was inconsistent, the wait was not. Both times I have been here we were waiting forever. And the location is a little inconvenient for me. I remember the cornbread being really delicious. Very cute decor though! Seems like a family place.
