Yolk. It's the best part of the egg. The interior of the restaurant is deceptively bigger than it looks from the outside. Plus. The long line (many runners/walkers from the Susan G. Komen race, like us, this past Sat.) of customers was handled expertly, and our group of 6 didn't have to wait as long as expected.  I ordered the irish benny eggs benedict (it has corned beef hash on it). I would have liked the hash to have been crisper and way less salty. Get your belly ready because the portions are hefty! Great coffee and coffee service.
