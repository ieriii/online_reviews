I LOVE THIS PLACE! I recently turned vegan, and was not sure if I could do it...but this place satisfies my every craving! They also have organic margaritas, beer, bloody mary's, & more alcoholic beverages. Everyone must try their delicious bakery items. My all time favorite menu item is the Titanic burger, but I recently attended their 29th anniversary party and had the Chikun pesto panini...looks like the Titanic may start sinking. My father, who hails from a cattle rancher/ industry family, recently tried some of the items...could not believe it was organic & vegan. His opinion speaks loudly in regards to what this restaurant offers. It is slowly becoming my families choice for dining. So long Ruth Chris, McCormick, Alinea, & Lawry's. Hello healthy, vegan, & organic Chicago Diner!
