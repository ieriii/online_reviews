Dined here for the second time last night, and had a lovely experience. We shared the hummus, which was fresh and topped with green olives and olive oil, and I had the dolmeh felfel with dill rice. He had the swordfish with dill rice. We each had Persian tea (which, to my understanding, is Earl Grey with cardamom, and amazing).  The hummus was good, but not as good as Semiramis' down the street. Our entrees were huge and tasty, and the service was speedy and pleasant (a shout out here to the manager/hostess who was very friendly and stopped by to make recommendations and answer our questions). The interior of the restaurant is lovely, and the prices are pretty fair.  That said, I do think the food is of equal (or better) quality at Semiramis, but Semiramis is less expensive (though simpler in decor). Also, Semiramis is BYOB, which is a big plus in my book.  The verdict? I'd go back to Noon O Kabab for a special occasion where ambience was of particular import. I would also order in from them, since I don't think Semiramis delivers.
