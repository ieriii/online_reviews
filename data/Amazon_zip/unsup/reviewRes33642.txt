I came here with some friends, at the high recommendation of a couple members of our party. To me, I was a little skeptical because one person's idea of a great restaurant will always be different from another, and I also thought, "Italian food is Italian food." But hey, I was going into it more for the time with friends, not necessarily the food. I was not disappointed. The service was fast, though not rushed, and friendly. We all were seated by about 6:45, and we were done eating and had our bill around 7:30, or shortly thereafter. And the restaurant was pretty busy the whole time we were there. The food was delicious and delivered hot. We all shared one order of each type of their bruschetta, and my entree was linguine tossed with prosciutto and a cream sauce. The portions were huge. One couple split their gnocchi and were full, and despite my boyfriend taking a few bites of my food toward the end, I still ended up taking the rest home. The dessert menu looked great, but I was so full I knew that having dessert would have been a poor choice, though I wouldn't mind visiting them again just for the sweets. Four stars because of the excellent service and food. Only four stars because it seemed to be rather loud in the restaurant, which didn't quite match the decor. The decor lends itself toward something quieter, but with an open kitchen and tables close together, we occasionally had to raise our voices a bit to be heard, and the tables aren't even that large. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but just prepare yourself because you may initially walk in and think you're in for a quieter dinner, when really, depending on how busy they are, you may need to speak up a bit to be heard by your companions. But overall, I really liked this place and am so glad I took my friends' recommendation. I plan to go back again.
