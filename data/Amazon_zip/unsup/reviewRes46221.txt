Oooooh went here over the weekend and it was just damn good food. Everything we ordered was just amazing, and the best part by far is the street view you get from your table! The restaurant is made by the same people as the Cheesecake Factory, and this is very evident as soon as you walk in. I really liked the decor, and the portions they give are just as big as the Cheesecake's. We ordered the box of cookies which they make while you eat your food, and they come out all warm and gooey - soooo good! Our waiter was very friendly and attentive .. I never had to ask for a refill once while dining. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone for any occasion. People dining were there for various reasons - dates, family gatherings, corporate dinners. It was good food and good prices, and the view can't be beat!
