This place was nice, though a little full of itself. The laid back atmosphere of the (small) bar area was far better than the dining room. Some of the staff seemed very uppity and nervous. The bartender, though, was awesome. I should have just stayed at the bar! Good beer. If I go back, I'll sit on the patio-- it looked really cute.
