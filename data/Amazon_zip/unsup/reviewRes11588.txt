jeez, i never wanted to go here because the wait was always so long. the fam came into town this past weekend and i figured it was a nice day and i was willing to go for the hour wait. the wait time was spot on. i kept checking back, but our table for 7 was available right at that hour wait time. after being sat we got coffee and juices. then we tried to decide what we were going to get. everything sounds so super, it was really hard to choose. 3 of us got the croissant breakfast sandwich which was super. 2 got build your own omelets. i got the prime rib eggs benedict which was DELICIOUS! we also all shared the lemon ricotta pancakes. it was so definitely worth the wait. everything was so good.
