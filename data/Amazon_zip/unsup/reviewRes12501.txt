This is the best brewery in Chicago, and if you get away from the traditional tomato-sauce-style pizza, this is the best pizza. If you like it hot, try the barbecue sauce and some jalapenos mixed in with your other favorite toppings. You won't regret it (until the next day). For a calmer post-meal-stomach, try the white pizza.
