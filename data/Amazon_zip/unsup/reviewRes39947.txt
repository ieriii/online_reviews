So they have decent cocktails, ok beer selection, mannnnnny whiskeys (of course), nice wine list, But! I do find Longman and Eagle to be the most OVERRATED and OVERHYPED bar/restaurant in Chicago! A Michelin star? Whaaa?!? Can you pay for these "stars"? If so, I think L&E may have spent a pretty penny for their cute little plaque. This is not up to the caliber of Tru, Alinea, Blackbird or Topolobampo. It's way overpriced for what it is. Ok it's a pretty good Sloppy Joe, but we should remember - it's a damn Sloppy Joe. And probably the most expensive Joe you will ever experience. I think the ONLY reason this place is getting loads of attention is due to it's so-called "hipster" location. Finally, an upscale bar/restaurant in the ever-so cutting edge, Logan Square. Lets take a little road trip to see these sweaty hipsters in action (oh yeah - i think the owner refuses to turn on the A/C - Cheap!)! If this was NYC - who the hell would care about this place? But! The colorful staff of L&E is full of all sorts of tricks. Like this one: the heavy man who shakes the cocktail and ignores you while he insults his co-workers, or the smug girl who keeps her head down to avoid getting my drink! or the owner who is barking at the poor door girl! All of this tension just made us quickly leave after our very mediocre dinner. There is one silver-lining in this dark cloud though: the craft cocktail was a good one! I would have order another if they would have addressed a girl standing at the bar with money her hands. Oh, just one more thing - There is a dress code if you don't know: PLAID and BEARD.
