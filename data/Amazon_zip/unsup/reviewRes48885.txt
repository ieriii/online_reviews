One star for the beers. The food was absolutely DISGUSTING!!! Even if I ate pork (my fucking dumbass date, who is a surgeon, no less, knows I don't consume filthy swine), I would never waste a dime here. The salad was drenched in oil. The shrimp sausage made me puke a little in my mouth. It had the consistency of scrambled eggs, but flavor of seafood?!? Hall of Shame, ultimate barfable dish. Service was friendly & attentive. Place is LOUD. Small tables acceptable, but the center of the restaurant is stand-up "cocktail" tables?! Where the hell are we...the Renaissance Festival?! Utterly stupid idea. WORST MEAL OF MY LIFE. I went to Jewell on the way home for a box of cereal & a bag of frozen broccoli.
