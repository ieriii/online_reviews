i went here for a date with my fabulous bf. we sat outside and it was thee absolute perfect night. this is the breakdown of what we ordered: - fried spring rolls, these were tasty and i liked the options to roll with lettuce. mint, etc. - fresh spring rolls. equally as good but does not compare to my mom's.. - duck. my bf got this and it was good. the taste was very good. i think the texture was a little too rubbery and the skin wasn't crispy. - sweet & sour fish. this dish was very good. the sauce they pour over it is excellent. loved it. wish the fish was a little bit more crispy - otherwise it would have been perfect. - fried rice. i liked that the chicken was shredded into the rice but the taste was okay. and not to sound like my mother but i've made fried rice waaaay better then what we had.
