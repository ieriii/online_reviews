Hands down the best thin crust in Wicker Park. I love coming here, and love the environment. Great place to watch a game, or invite friends from out of town. In general, their pizza never ever ever leaves me hungry.It gets packed pretty quickly, so keep that in mind, but I love coming in here on lazy sundays.My one gripe with this place is the service. Everyone is super friendly and nice, but I've been here about 20 times, and it always seems like it takes them forever to refill water or sodas. That, and it takes a long as time to get the bill. It's not like the servers are lazy or anything, it's just something that I always notice every time I bring friends in (they notice it too). Other than that... it's a fantastic place to eat.
