Visiting Chicago for a couple of weeks, so I decided to try some solo dining out.... At 8pm on a Thursday nite, I had about a 5 minutes wait for a table.  The place was busy and even the bar was packed. Ordered a pomagrante martini which was yummy but if I'd known in was $12, I would not have gotten it.  Had the small side salad for $4 (and it IS small; its served in a bowl the size of a small cup of soup.)  The house tomato vinaigrette was delicious on it, however. The bread served while I waited for my entree was spectacular. Warm and tasty, crunchy crust, and the butter was thankfully not an ice cube to attempt to spread on it. My entree was the pasta with chicken mushrooms and sundried tomatoes. It was a huge serving of food, as expected. I wasn't too fond of the form of pasta they used for it. I believe it was gemelli; would have preferred a fetucchini because this shape just seemed to dense, somehow. The dish itself could have been more flavorful and used more of the sun dried tomatoes. IN general, I'd say I was reasonably happy with the food I got, but $35 for a modest meal for one person seems a bit too much; at least I can get either one or two more meals off the left overs!
