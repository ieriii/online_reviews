Having a Korean-American wife and Korean mother-in-law I would say that I have a decent idea of what good Korean food tastes like. This place used to be the above average in my book but has definitely downgraded its food from good to horrible. On top of that, the service is egregiously rude. I am amazed that they call themselves servers at all since they are not deserving of this title. I don't know about you but when someone puts a dish on the corner of the table without announcing the name of the dish or the trying to find out who ordered it, I find myself holding back really hard from giving them a $0 tip. To explain this shift in quality, some say that ownership has changed, others say that the growing presence of non-Koreans dining here has diluted the service/food quality. Whatever the reason, I would rather eat cardboard than come back here again.
