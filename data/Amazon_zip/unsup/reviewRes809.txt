CASH ONLY!!! Prices include tax. I've been a pretty regular customer here for years, so the gang knows me by my nickname. Their revolving Specials menu is bookmarked on my cell phone and computer. I stick to the beef and/or pork sausages since I am not a huge fan of chicken sausages or game meats, which I hear are excellent if you are more adventurous than I am. Doug has perfected the flavor combinations between the sausages and their individual toppings for each Specials menu item. Please don't be a boob and order a regular hotdog with the traditional fixins. You can do that at the Home Depot hot dog stand. Hot Doug's is a dining experience and deserves more respect than that. I don't think many people know you can order tater tots, and I actually prefer them over the fries. TATER TOTS! The line can be long but it moves fairly quickly. Totally worth the wait as long as you don't go in to order just a regular hotdog. Once you have ordered, you don't need to stand in line again if you decide you want more food - just ask one of the guys or gals on the floor and they will collect your cash and put the order in to Doug for you. For those ordering to-go, the sausages are wrapped up in paper so they are super easy to reheat.
