Grand luxe Cafe is a good place to go on Michigan Ave if you're doing the touristy thing or entertaining someone from out of town. It's like the Chicago version of the Cheesecake Factory, although honestly I think that Grand Luxe has better food and better dessert so if you like the Cheesecake Factory you should really check out Grand Luxe. My only complaint with Grand Luxe so far is that its pricy. I've gone there a couple of times and the services has been good, and the wait not too long.
