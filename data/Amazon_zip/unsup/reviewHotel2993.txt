I'm definitely a fan of W Hotels, but I can't say this location is one of my fav's! As other's have mentioned, the retro-fit was poorly done and it's especially noticeable when it comes to their heating or air-conditioning. The rooms have a tough time keeping a consistent temperature, and the hallways are either overly warm or overly cold. Tough to find common ground. The bright side is, service doesn't get much better. There's nothing this hotel won't do to help make your stay more enjoyable. From great restaurant recommendations to driving you in the Acura Experience. (which btw, is very common among W Hotels). So it's really a toss up for me....the the prices the command, I really don't believe there's room for imperfection. As a matter of fact, try ordering a bottle to the room, and you'll probably fall off your chair - $250 bottle, $3.50 delivery, $51 bottle service, and $26 tax....WTF!!!!  are you serious!!!??? As for location, there's a great lake view, you're right by Navy Pier, and you're about 3 blocks (long blocks though) from Michigan (Magnificent Mile). So while I'd agree there isn't all that much within the immediate block of this hotel, there are many options if you walk a few blocks. It's a toss up for me....but I think they'll have trouble getting my business again.....too many choices in the great City of Chicago to be paying top dollar and receive sub-par value. Just my opinion.
