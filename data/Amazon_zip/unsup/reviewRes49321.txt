Alliance sees me every weekend for a bagel and coffee...or when I'm off of work, or it's a holiday and I need a special occasion cookie or cupcake. Working from home always turned into working at Alliance. A great addition to the UK Village that I hope never leaves, because I can't as long as it is there.
