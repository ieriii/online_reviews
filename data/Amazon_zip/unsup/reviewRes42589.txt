This pizza was OK, but nothing stood out enough to really bring me back. Maybe I should have ordered just plain cheese (my staple when it comes to pizza), but since they didn't even list it on their menu I figured I would step outside the box and try something different. We got the Spinach & Ricotta pizza, and it had good flavor, but the crust was a little soggy. There are much better options for pizza around here, so I would say skip it if you want pizza, but I've heard the chicken is good, so I won't write the whole place off.
