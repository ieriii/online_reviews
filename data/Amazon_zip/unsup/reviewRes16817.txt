Beautiful space. Great mojitos. Awesome guacamole. Meat, meat and more meat. This is how I sum up Carnivale. It's a great place for a date or a girls' night out. It's festive, colorful and makes you want to get up and shake your hips a bit. Sure, I wouldn't normally pay $9.50 for a mojito, but at least it tasted good. The atmosphere alone makes this restaurant a must-try, because while the food is delicious, it's not overly original. There was a hold up in the kitchen, so we were given a free mid course that was just divine. I didn't feel like the wait was too bad, but it was extremely nice of them to let us know what was going on and to make up for it by providing a little "snack" before dinner. Service was attentive and there was no wait (though we had a reservation at 5, which is when they open). I will definitely be back!
