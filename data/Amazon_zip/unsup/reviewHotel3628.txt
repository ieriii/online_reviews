The finest hotel in Chicago, my family has stayed here on several occasions when in the city. The hotel itself is extremely elegant, in fact regal. There is NO other place to stay in Chicago. Located on the Magnificent Mile, the Drake is walking distance to several amazing stores (think Gucci, Prada, etc.) as well as great restaurants and shopping. The hotel staff is extremely professional and courteous.
