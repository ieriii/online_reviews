My husband and I are both young professionals, and self-professed foodies. His office is located very close by the Gilt Bar. As many have said before, the speak-easy atmosphere is fun and the food pretty tasty, although some of the sauces can be slightly heavy handed, and the menu relies perhaps a little too much on comfort food - an easy crowd pleaser. We've been a few times before and enjoyed dinner, wine and cocktails, but this past experience our waiter was absolutely AWFUL!!! He came across as rude, arrogant, and when I asked a few simple questions regarding some of the dishes extremely dismissive. I refuse to return, and can think of tons of other restaurants aspiring for the same vibe that understands the value of a well-trained staff.
