Very wholesome, tasty and extremely authentic. When you walk in, you are bombarded by exotic aromas. I had the short-rib red chili caldo and it was very well done. I found it to be a bit salty but given the restaurant is inspired by Mexican-street food, shouldn't it be a little salty? The meat and roasted veggies complimented each other perfectly and melted in my mouth. My dining companion had the Jamon and I was drooling watching him eat it. We went on a Friday night around 8:30pm and didn't have to wait more than 20 minutes to order and be served. It was still busy but nothing inconvenient. Chips and gauc were awesome - don't forget to order that!
