This is by far my favorite brunch place. We called them Sunday morning and asked if we could make a reservation for that morning. When we walked in there they had a table waiting for us and still had about a 45 minute wait. I felt like I was sitting in the old south- Savannah or charleston. The decor was great. I seriously had the hardest time deciding what to eat. Everything looked and smelled amazing. I wasn't extremely hungry since we just walked a mile in sweltering heat so I just ordered 2 eggs, cheese grits, toast and bacon. The cheese grits are to die for. I also tasted my friends fish and grits which melted in my mouth. They also served us bignettes (spelling?) for free which were delicious! I will have the pancakes next time. Can't wait to go back!
