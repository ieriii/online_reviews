Visited on Saturday afternoon right at the opening. Quiet place with amazing selection on draft, and bottles were quite nice as well. Too many servers on staff, so they ended up talking to each other rather than give great service, but the service was tolerable so I didn't complain. Typical beer bar atmosphere. Did not sample the food so I cannot comment here. Several good Med restaurants nearby. Hopleaf is always on my list for "must see" places when I visit Chicago periodically. Daytime patronage is recommended for getting the most out of your beer tasting here.
