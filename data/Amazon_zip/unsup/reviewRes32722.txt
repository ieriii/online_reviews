this is my place to go to pig the eff out. i am always stuffed to the gills leaving this place. i literally eat more in one sitting here than i do anywhere, and i'm a petite lass. this is what i eat: salad and a blue sky cola, wings (OMG!), gyros, and i split a peppermint soy shake with my husband. i've also gotten the mac 'n' cheese and the smart loaf there, too. delish. my only gripe with the place is that it's preposterously small and always jampacked. we've driven over with a hankerin' for some good veg foodies and left brokenhearted once we saw everyone sitting on the parkbench outside. actually having a parking lot is good, but the parking lot itself isn't great.
