My friend has been raving about this place for ages, so I finally joined him for dinner and was somewhat disappointed. We ordered guacamole to start and it was just fair, and the salsa was missing a kick. For my entree I got the Onion Steak and I got an Oatmeal shake to drink. I have to say, the Oatmeal shake was very good. The steak, however, was very greasy and not very tender. The onions gave it a good flavor, but the quality was not that exceptional. If I lived a few blocks away I might come back in a pinch, but otherwise the only reason I would revisit Irazu would be to get another delicious oatmeal shake.
