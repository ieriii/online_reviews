A regular spot for my boyfriend and me. We always get kalbi. The ladies are hit or miss in the service area. But you just have to play their game by being pushy and short with them as well. They don't have time (or want to make time) to sit and hold your hand through the menu. If you are a Korean food first timer, I would STRONGLY suggest going wtih a Korean who is familiar with the food.. Although, I do have to say that I've been there before and heard one of the ladies explaining the menu to a couple who was new to the experience. I think the ladies that work there are adjusting to the new wave of having people that aren't korean actually coming in to try it! I've had a few of their soups and what not.. they're all pretty good, but there are other places in the city that specialize in soups/stews. I've had the cold buckwheat noodles, they sucked, don't ever get them. The rice with a bunch of vegetables in a stone bowl is ALWAYS a safe bet for first timers (its what I tell all of my first timer friends to get, if not kalbi).  All in all, it's yummy and fun!
