Love the dogs! We were in line for about 45 minutes, but could totally understood the wait. Everything was cook to order and fresh. We had 3 gourmet hot dogs (Foie gras, spicy sausage, and something else) plus the classic Chicago style hot dog. They were all good with the Chicago style being the best. Trust me, I always eat hot dogs with nothing but ketchup, but I am now a fan of the Chicago style. Thanks to Doug!
