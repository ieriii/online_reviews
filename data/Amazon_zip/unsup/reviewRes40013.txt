as long as they serve the negroni, i will be a customer. yeah, this place is totally hipster'd out. but they do make wicked good cocktails. i spent a steamy summer weekday afternoon getting buzzed on their patio. it was wonderful :) and on the weekdays, there's no wait for a table. might be worth playing hooky. just sayin'...
