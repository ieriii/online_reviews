So much fun. My wife and I took our daughter and boyfriend to celebrate her 24th bday on a Saturday night. They don't take reservations...but it didn't matter--we met there at 7:30 pm and the place was packed. We were told it would be only 20-30 min, so we made our way to the bar. 20 min later we had our table. Great wines, excellent food, excellent service. Great!
