I absolutely love this place! Last night my friend C and I decided to go in for a quick drink. We were greeted by a lovely hostess who wished me a belated B-day after checking my ID. Our bartender, Suzie, mixed me the most amazing Dark and Stormy I've had in a looong time. Believe me, I've tasted a lot of Dark Stormys (my favorite wintertime cocktail) and Violet Hour makes the very best. We had two absolutely scrumptious appetizers (don't remember names but one contained trout and the other anchovies on flatbread). Great service, drinks and food!
