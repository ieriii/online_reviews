What a treat to discover this place is in my hood and I didn't even know it! Since making the transition to vegetarian, I have a new addiction to falafel. The falafel sandwiches here are a good size, but I don't care for the cucumber mix so I usually leave that out. The little vegetarian buffet looks good as well which I hope to soon sample. So far every time we've been here the place is non-stop busy. Its cheap, delicious, and healthy!
