Revolution's food is really...satisfying. It's more of a gastro-pub than a restaurant, so it's essentially very high-end bar food. There are plenty of vegetarian options, and the tempeh reuben and tofu sammich were both delectable. They've got a great beer selection (it's a brewery, duh), so no matter what kind of beer you like, they'll have something for your taste on tap. I initially thought that the decor was kind of campy, but after asking one of the employees about it I had a newfound respect for the place: turns out the whole interior is crafted from beer-related materials like wooden beer barrels or metal barrel hoops (you'll see them if you look up at the lights!). It's all very well considered--and though it still looks a little too polished to fit in with the rest of the neighborhood, I think it's only a matter of time before Revolution becomes more of a local staple and less of a shiny new kid in town. At any rate, the crowd is definitely a little older, a little more yuppie, and a little more married than those you'll find at Logan Square's dive bars. And while I love my dive bars, I have to admit that it's nice to have this dive-antithesis so close to home. While it's pretty chill during lunch, it's loud and hectic on weekend nights--so be prepared to wait for a table. When I was here on busy evenings, it was so loud I had to yell to be heard by the others at my table. In this sense it's not optimal for a first date or a more intimate conversation (unless maybe you're sitting at the bar). It IS optimal for filling meals, takeout, and drankin'.
