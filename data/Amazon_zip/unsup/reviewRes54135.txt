I gave this place the best rating because of the food alone. I read other reviews on yelp that had no compliants but only gave 4 stars- I guess the only way those reviewers would give 5 stars is if the food was also free. I have had the Ahogada and the cubana both delicious. However I'm vietnamese so I love soups as meals but I am extremely picky about them. I was actually reluctant to try the caldos here for fear that I would be disappointed. I orderd the Fideo and really loved it. The broth was complex and the texture of the ingredients complimented the flavors. The pork belly was insanely good. No wonder there is a screen blocking your view of how they make their caldos. As for service. I thought for how busy this place is the staff balances it by being very pleasant- full of smiles and helpful suggestions. The hostess is very informative as well as checking back in with you about wait times often. I especially liked this place because on my fourth visit here an obnoxious guy ( He pretended to know Rick Bayless by saying hi to him and asking why is this place always so busy. If you really knew a chef/owner of a busy restaurant it is never seen as a problem that it is constantly busy. Rick just nodded at him without a reply.) cut in front of me to place his order. He knew he cut in front of me - I mean I was standing in front of him for the last 30 minutes. But I guess Xoco karma balances things out here. I was seated next to him and my food came out quickly. I was finished eating and got up to leave before he ever got his food. I saw him look over and look confused about why his food wasn't out yet. This place is great.
