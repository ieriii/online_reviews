Great food, great service! We were told it would be a 30 minute wait, but it ended up only being 5. Very attentive. Our waiter made some recommendations and he was right about the appetizer we ordered, skewered chicken with mashed potato and  Cuban garlic sauce. It was yummy. I had camarones al ajillo, shrimp with garlic sauce. It came with black beans and white rice, and maduros or sweet plantains. I was afraid to order the dish because sometimes shrimp just doesn't taste right, but it was excellent. We drank their sangria mix and it was perfect for our meal. We finished with the flan de coco, coconut flan...sweet and wonderful. The atmosphere is a bit loud and gets crowded, but you don't mind it because of how well you're treated and the atmosphere. My husband said it was the first time in a long time that he really enjoyed dining out. We were full and were so happy that we decided to check this place out! We will be going back with our family next time with reservations!
