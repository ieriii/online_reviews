I absolutely adore Meli. It is probably one of my favorite brunch spots in the city. On the weekends there will definitely be a wait, but it's well worth it. The coffee and juices are amazing, as well as almost every plate imaginable. Personally I'm a fan of the omelettes and the potatoes on the side, but I've sampled pancakes and french toast, which was great as well.
