I was excited to try the place because their menu gave me hope. And then I was disappointed. I ordered a veggie burger and specifically said I wanted NO pickles because they make me gag. I really can't stand them! The waitress assured me that I wouldn't get them. My food came and BAM a handful of pickles and pickle juice were running down the plate, onto the burger and potato pancake. Grreeeat, already off to a bad start. The burger was bland and could use way more seasoning. I didn't even eat one half of the sandwich. The refills for my water came slow. The service wasn't great, nothing special, just a little slow. I was charged for a large orange juice but I only ordered a small. The waitress took the OJ off the tab completely. Cool but I would not go back again.
