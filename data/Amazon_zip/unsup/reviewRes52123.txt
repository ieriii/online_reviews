So, my friends visiting LA from last weekend were told by locals Gino's is one of the best pizza places in the city. I arrived a few minutes early and the line curving out the door caused me concern. I know, some people consider it a good sign... right!? Well, to me, lines like this speak volumes... caution, hype, you'll be underwhelmed. And, I was. The service was horrible. It took the server at least 10 minutes even to get us water/drinks. Of course, we already had our meal planned in this time. I asked for antipasta, they were out. Huh?!? The three of us ordered house salads, 1 didn't come, a second had the wrong dressing. Personally, deep dish isn't my favorite but... when in Rome. It was okay, decent...good - I guess. But it doesn't make up for the cheesy graffiti (hello... contrived!) and the loads of Sebrings (you'll get it if you read my other reviews). I've lived here a month now, I've settled in, my visitors have left town - on to more unique places so I an start giving some 4 and 5 stars.
