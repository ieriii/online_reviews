One of my favorite places that I ate at during my Chicago trip. I had to xoco salad, which was surprisingly filing thanks to a big helping of carnitas :) My boyfriend had a torta that came in tomato soup! Also surprisingly good, but probably not the smartest choice in the 80+ weather. We ended with their famous churros and soft serve - I've been craving it since we left.
