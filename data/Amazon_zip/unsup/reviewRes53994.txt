Can anyone say pretentious? Once we were inside, the experience was fine but the line experience was a little much. It would be one thing if you had to wait in line and people were seated in the order that they arrived. But it seemed like if you were in with the door guy, then you got to go in front of everyone else. I mean who is this establishment kidding. This is Chicago - lighten the fuck up!
