I adore Meli. From the moment they set my delightful banana maple crunch smoothie in front of me, I knew it was love... it's hard to go wrong when there is the magical combination of maple and banana. I can't really even elaborate on that... except to say that the texture of the smoothie was pretty much heavenly, not too rich, and definitely a smoothie texture than a milkshake-y one. The lovely waitress even split the smoothie for my dining partner and myself to share. Hoorah. The service was all-around excellent. Continuing on... I had the jalapeno skillet... which was pretty much to die for. I did almost die for it, because my body and chorizo do not get along... but the pure deliciousness I experienced was definitely worth the stomach pain. I look forward to returning to Chicago to have another go at Meli... I'm actually drooling just thinking about it...
