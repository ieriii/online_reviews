Delicious, pretty casual, fun spot. Well-lit, so it's not romantic. Excellent seafood, oysters were amazing. Swordfish was excellent, no sides but the salsa was great. Had a chocolate desert with peppermint ice cream... amazing! Service very attentive. Would definitely recommend for a relaxed evening out.
