As you scan the menu, you notice an almost manga like play on names for Korean Cuisine. The Bibimbop is artfully referred to as the Buddha Bowl. However, as a word of warning, this is not a Korean Restaurant in every sense. You don't get the ten thousand side dishes that you would usually get from a many fine Korean establishments lining up the Northwest Side of Chicago (Lawrence/Lincoln/Western). This place shines for providing simple but delicious food for reasonable prices leaning on Korean spices and flavor. The Buddha Bowls are not served on Korean Stone Pots but the ingredients are certainly fresh with generous beef helpings at your request. They also have chicken offerings which are absolutely divine and gently guides you through a path of spices. For those who are spice-averse, there is Plain Jane. I highly recommend the Crisps Fried Chicken, it is a smooth balanced between spicy and sweet for the uninitiated. The establishment is clean and has a generous selection of beverages. I especially applaud the inclusion of asian beverages which are usually can only be found at Asian Foodmarts north of Lawrence. The service is courteous with food served in a reasonable amount of time. So if you want an artful place to eat without depleting your wallet, Crisp is the place to go in Lakeview.
