Has to be good right? All you see is Vietnamese people here lined out the door. The neighborhood can be severe sketch at night, walking to the liquor store down the street you have your "street" eyes on the lookout. But when you get by the doors of this uptown place, you just know you are in for a treat. The one way i know this is a comeback spot is the plate of fresh veggies/herbs you are getting on the side. That thai basil and smells like the have a 12 foot plant in the back and this is straight off the root. But to the Pho and other goodness. Both times i've been here i've only been pleasantly surprised by the goodness that is being served. Hot broth that has been simmered for a long time, noodles that have been expertly cooked and not sticking to each other and good meat (i had the oxtail here and it was delic). The second trip was for caramelized pork and shrimp in the clay pots. A little salty but otherwise well seasoned. The servings are generous and you know you are eating food cooked by some of the better experts around. Check out this BYOB. Average bill has been about $20 with apps.
