Sultans is a good place. Their shawarma is great, their falafel is good, the egg sandwiches are also nice. Everything is fresh and fast and the service is friendly. It's in a convenient location, just a block from the Damen L stop. One thing that bugs me is that if you want to get a variety (which I love to do eating this kind of food), you really have to pay for it. You can't really get a sampler or variety plate so you have to start adding stuff to your order and weighing it, which definitely adds up. I guess the big reason why I don't give it a higher rating is that I feel it has a definite advantage because it seems like one of the only places of its kind in the area. I'm from Michigan, which has a higher percentage of Arabs, obviously lending the culture more. It's really easy to find great Middle Eastern food there, in huge portions for cheap there. Paying $10 for a drink, a falafel sandwich, and some hummous isn't a great deal. Sultan's is good, but in a large part because there's not that much competition.
