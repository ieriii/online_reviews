Would like to give this a 3.75, but can only can give 3 per the scale given- I've been wanting to try out Mastro's since it opened, finally did on 4/3/11- Seated in the area where the bar is, there are tables along the walls while high tables with stools are in the middle, there are is nice and dark-Nice sexy feel to the place and I think a good place to meet people for a bite/drink- FOOD: I ordered the 8 oz. filet Rare-I was put off by the 400* plates my steak would arrive on so asked for a room temp plate instead, I don't need my food to be cooking when it comes out to me-Asked for a side of Bearnaise sauce as well- Food came out quick, I must say it's the first time I've had a rare steak that was ice cold in the middle-I felt my steak at Chicago Cut Steakhouse was better quality, it just tasted better there it wasn't ice cold, that just put me off-I know it should be cool to the touch but not cold- The sides were good but the green beans were way to buttery and the gnocchi could be a dish on it's own, very filling and we got the 1/2 side- CONS: Smelled like food after I left-They walk around and cook something at a table and then you are covered in the smell, which I don't care for-
