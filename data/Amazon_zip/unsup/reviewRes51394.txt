I've been going to Garcias for years.....over 15 to be more specific. Yes things have changed in some areas....some for the good, some for the bad. BUT....instead of sitting here and writing bad reviews about the service, TALK TO THE MANAGERS! They will listen. I to have had a bad waitress experience....but guess what? I actually spoke up instead of hiding behind my keyboard and I have seen improvement. The owner or his son are usually there and they will get on someones butt about bad and/or slow service, even your complaints about the food. (YES, I have been a witness to it). A few of the Hostesses at the front door have been there for awhile and will listen to your gripes as well. Garcias has been around for so long because people do like their food and keep coming back. They have been a staple in Lincoln Square for a loooong time. Other Mexican restaurants have tried to come in and establish themselves, but to no avail, they have closed their doors as quick as they opened them. Garcias has a pretty loyal following and I believe it will continue. So speak up and if you have chosen to boycott them, give them another chance.
