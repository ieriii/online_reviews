In short: definitely a place to check out...multiple times! I stumbled into Gilt Bar after a networking event, so I already was feeling quite high and was pleased with the speed at which we were seated. The atmosphere is very chill, with low lighting and wood-esque (yeah I said that) interior. Our server was very friendly and attentive, and the company I was with made for a great experience. One negative: they were out of the ribeye, which is such a hot item that they actually mark it as limited availability on the menu. Thus, while my friends all went with the chicken (cue Dave Chappelle quote), I had the grilled duroc pork belly with farro verde, asparagus and raspberry glaze (I love a good swine :-D) Our entrees were flanked with blackened cauliflower, asparagus, and rapini. The meal was finished quite nicely with the carrot cake, of which we split but I ate more than my fair share. Gilt is also in a great location for bar hopping afterwards, if you're making a night of things. Stay classy, Ev
