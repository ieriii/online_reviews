Brunch here is alright. They have an extensive menu, which can be overwhelming -and some of their "out there" ideas are exactly that - way out there. Once I conned myself into thinking I wanted a sweet/savory breakfast so I got some "California"-ish crepe with avocado and eggs and other things...it tasted as weird as it sounds. Boyfriend, who loves sweet things, said the Cinnamon Roll French Toast was good, but almost too sweet for him (never would I have imagined that possible). Their skillets are decent, their eggs benedict IS good (but I don't know if i'd hail it as the best in the city like they do...), overall it's just your average brunch place on Michigan. I'd never wait more than a half hour for brunch here though, and I've seen people do that a lot.
