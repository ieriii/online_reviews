Based on the sign outside you may never elect to visit Mayan. If you do, you'll be pleased. Even more pleased if its a Tuesday or Thursday (1/2 off margaritas. I had the lime and it was de-lish). I wouldn't say this place is a dive. The prices wouldn't deem it a dive, either. The dining room is small but feels authentic. Food isn't date-worthy but was good. Visiting the website http://www.themayanpalac left me confused. The restaurant is called "Mayan Palace" but the header says "Matan Palace"?
