rooms nice/staff unhelpful I stayed here for one night this past week. The room was tidy and comfortable, and the beds nice.however, some parts were dated, like the TV, which was CRT and had a terrible warp in the picture around the sides. On the negative side, the concierge and front desk staff were totally unhelpful. They had way too much trouble answering simple transit and restaurant related questions, and, because of their answers, we found ourselves late for an appointment across town.
