Love this place! The staff is informative, attentive and sexy,. The food has always exceeded my expectations. Yeah,yeah,yeah, the portions are small and it's pricey but deal with it. This isn't a meat and potato joint, it's a unique and creative dinning experience. If you're starving don't get the tasting go bigger. If you're a cheapskate looking to eat as much food as your gut can handle and a waiter up your ass all night there's a lovely Chili's down the street.
