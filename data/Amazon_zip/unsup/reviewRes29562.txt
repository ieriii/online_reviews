I was here a couple months ago with a friend and had a good time. You know it's going to be good when Rick Bayless is backing it. The guacamole is a must, and I had the duck entree with tortillas. AMAZING! My friend had the scallops, very good as well. It's a great mexican/amercian type fusion, and Bayless is definitely a great chef.
