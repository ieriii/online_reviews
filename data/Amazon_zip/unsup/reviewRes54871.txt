I guess I'm not really the best person to review the Hopleaf, being that I've never actually drank OR dined there, but not for lack of trying.I've heard so many good things about it that I've TRIED to eat/drink there several times and it's always the same thing:You walk in, get carded and wait for service.....nothing happens.I've tried to get a table (even as early as 6pm) , but it seems the kind of place that people just sit forever at. I once stood at the bar for almost 15 minutes waiting to get a beer and ended up walking out. Another downfall is that it's obnoxiously loud in the front (i've never been to the back or upstairs), so loud that I had to yell for my friends standing right next to me to hear. If you like a moderately quiet atmosphere and good service, don't stop here.
