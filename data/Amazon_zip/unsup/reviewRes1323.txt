This review is long overdue and Hot Doug's doesn't really need my review, but I'm going to write one anyway. A line begins before the place even opens (on a weekend anyway), speedy service, and amazing selection of hot dogs to choose from. Between 6 of us we ordered at least 12 different hot dogs and I don't remember which ones exactly, but they were all good. Even though this place has a constant line I would say it's worth the wait, where else are you going to find hot dogs like this?
