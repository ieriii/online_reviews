I finally had a chance to visit the new location. It is SO much bigger and brighter and cleaner looking than the last location. As a group, we shared the Peking Duck (order in advance, otherwise they run out by the end of the night), a BBQ plate (with bbq pork, chicken, duck), chinese broccoli, fried bean curd rolls, fried tofu with mushrooms, duck soup, and duck fried rice. The restaurant will tell you the Peking duck is good for four people, but really, it's enough for eight people! You may need more buns for the duck though. We ran out of buns but still had duck meat left. It was great that they cut up the duck at the table before serving it to you. Everything is super fresh! Service was great and the prices were good too! The Peking Duck (which came with the fried rice and soup) was about $37. Split between 8 people, thats about a little less than $5 per person. Totally worth it! Some of us at the table ordered noodle soup, sweet and sour pork, egg rolls, seafood rice, and regular roasted duck (different from Peking). Everything looked and smelled good. Definitely a fan of Sun Wah BBQ! Easy to get to too! Right off the Red Line. Can't wait to come back!
