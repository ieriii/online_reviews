all I can say is you must go here. Agree with everything that has been said: terrific service. shrimp cocktail comes out on a steaming bed of dry ice...yummie! steaks are terrific. I don't mind it plain, I think the sauces hide all the goodness of the natural juice. but if you insist on a sauce, they have everything. even if it's not on the menu, they can make it for you. expensive. dark. bring a flashlight? came here with a big party, ordered every side on the menu. everything was good....don't let people bully you into ordering anything in particular because everything is great! (except you have to order the butter cake. that was so good). cannot wait to bring my mom here and buy her $12 oysters. what are you waiting for? go eat!
