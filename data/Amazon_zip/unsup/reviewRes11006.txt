Maybe the mistake was going on a Friday night though we thought we were on the early side of things (six-ish). Maybe the mistake was the hostess seating two obnoxious frat boys next to us. Maybe the mistake was expecting to be able to hold a conversation without shouting. What wasn't a mistake: the pizza and beer. I had an oatmeal stout that was excellent. My wife had a brown ale that I tasted and was the perfect combination of nuttiness and hoppiness. We ordered a medium pizza which the menu says feeds two to three. Only two slices remain in our fridge--either we were hungry or it was very tasty. I'd say the second, since I found the sauce seasoned just right (I hate really sweet pizza sauce, but this had a little zing to the flavor). Not gooey gobs of cheese, but enough to cover the pie, which we ordered with anchovy hearts and spinach. Except for the problems I mentioned--crowds of obnoxious people shouting loudly over their pitchers--I would have given Piece five stars. Those problems seriously impinged upon my dining experience. (Side note to the frat boy business majors sitting next to us: before you get real jobs, you might want to learn that "Oriental" is a very impolite term for "Asian" and "douchebag" is rarely acceptable in polite company.)
