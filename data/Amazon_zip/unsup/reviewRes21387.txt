I seriously considered NOT writing a review, because I did not want to attract any more patrons to the restaurant. If the wait was any longer...I would probably still wait in it. I am eager to try this place for breakfast, but we went for lunch the Friday after Thanksgiving, and there was only about a 25 minute wait. The line was all the way to the door when we arrived and they said that we would probably have a 45 minute wait, but we were delightfully surprised when it was much shorter. While waiting, I recommend going up front and ordering yourself the best hot chocolate you've ever had: the Aztec. The Aztec has a zesty mix of spices and is the thinnest consistency of the hot chocolate made there. I also tried the Almond Hot Chocolate, which I found to be WAY TOO SWEET and the Barcelona, which was also wonderful, but much creamier - its almost like a hot chocolate mousse. We all shared the soup of the day, which was good, but the highlight was by far the Tortas! We had the Woodland Mushroom Torta (fave), the Cubano Torta (close second), and the Pepito Torta (also great, but rich). I will be back very soon! Oh, and the ChocoFlan was exquisite, but definitely too rich for one person to finish alone. I recommend sharing, or getting it to go, so you can nibble at it all day.
