I've been to Carnivale only periodically but every time I wonder why I don't go more. The food is unique and fantastic. In particular the steaks are usually done properly. There are quite a few interesting plates (like the shredded chicken and plantain dish) that really are out of this world. I've never had an issue with the service and I really enjoy the atmosphere. It's a fun party feel with one giant room and I truly enjoy the loud "carnival" (yes I'm aware that's cliche) atmosphere. Highly recommended.
