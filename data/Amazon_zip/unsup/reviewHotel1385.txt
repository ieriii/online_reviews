I actually got the hotel on Priceline for something like $60 or whatever so I really didn't have really high expections. I read some pretty horrible reviews about this place from some of the other hotel review sites out there though so I was a little nervous.  I've actually never had a bad experience from Priceline and this was no different. For $60 or so, this place was great. Perfect location, friendly staff, all the basics. The room felt like it was out of the 60s with lots of dorky decor, but who cares, right?
