Ok, I have to give Rev Brew points for style and bar service, however since I haven't actually eaten there in the 3 times I have gone, I cannot report much more. I have happened upon RB 3 times on random Friday nights between the hours of 530 and 730, been quoted a reasonable wait-time 40 minutes for a party of 4-5.Each time as we patiently sip our cocktails, enjoy people watching and are involved deep in intellectual conversation we notice over 60 minutes has gone by with no hostess contacting us. Much to our chagrin, one of us appraoch the hostess stand and are told "you're next, and we are trying to get the table to leave asap" RIGHT
