Longman and Eagle being only 10 minutes away from my apartment, has become a place I frequent fairly often. I've done breakfast, lunch, and dinner. So far, dinner has been the best, followed by lunch, and then very sadly, breakfast comes in last. Breakfast is my favorite meal, and vegetarian-wise, there's usually plenty of options. Not so much at L&E. I had a very disappointing Morel omelette here this summer--it tasted kind of grainy. Now when we go for brunch, I usually opt for the "unch" more than the breakfast. For dinner, options are good, and to top it off, the food is GREAT. My favorite so far has been the Welsh Rarebit. It had me diving through my cookbooks when I got home to see if I could find a good pretzel recipe. Ambiance wise, L&E has it going on. A little dark on the inside, but has a nice casual feel with waiters wearing jeans and button-ups. I like that they give you a water bottle at your table. Oh yeah, and the bartending is fabulous. You can pretty much order any drink you can think of, so go for it!
