I liked the Violet Hour but it's a bit pretentious. Dubbed a minimalist pre-prohibition lounge. The tall chairs are cool and create intimacy in the first room. Behind that room are two more open rooms where conversations with randoms might be more accessible. If that's what you desire though, then don't come here. The music fit the vibe they were trying to create. I couldn't id any of it. Also you'll be ordering cocktails with mammoth ice cubes made of pure filtered water. Same stuff you put in an iron. woop dee doo and me circling a pointed index finger. The waitresses are cute but don't smile or joke. I wouldn't wait in line for this place normally but would check it out. If you want to just check it out, go alone on a slow night. Otherwise a good place to chill, talk and make faux snooty comments about the surroundings, i.e., low key under the radar jackassery.
