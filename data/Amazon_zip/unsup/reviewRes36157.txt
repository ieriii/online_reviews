Horrible customer service simply ruined our day and appetite. My friends and I have been regulars here for years. However every single time, we felt we have to put up with the receptionist's 'you-owe-me-a-million' attitude to get seated. After a snowy morning and half hour wait outside, and the blonde's rude reception, we decided to step out and never to come back again. Has Chicago ever run out of good brunch places? It just doesn't worth it any more. Come with a thick skin or leave with pride.
