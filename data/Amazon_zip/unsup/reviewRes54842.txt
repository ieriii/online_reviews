The best beer selection in the city. Great decor- awesome now that you have a choice to sit in the back where its less crowded!!!  the food is good- kind of a strange menu though.  Mainly its an awesome place to try new beers and hang with friends. A very eclectic mix of people go here- which is a nice change from the normal frat boy pub...
