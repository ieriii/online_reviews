Maybe I'm exaggerating but I've been to Gilt more times than I can count, which only speaks to how much I enjoy myself there. I can safely report that even after seven months of operations, the quality of the food and experience are top notch. One of the reasons I enjoy and seek out new restaurants is that I enjoy new and different flavors. The only downside to repeat visits to favorite places is that you get stuck in a groove of what you like. This isn't a bad thing, especially after some time apart, just something I am all too aware of. Last night that mold to the T because it had been a while since my last visit. I ordered my favorite drink(s), an Old Fashion and Hoffman's of PBR, the creamy and delicious burrata, shaved spring vegetables, the can't-stop-eating fries and two pasta dishes (rigatoni with rabbit confit and the ricotta gnocchi). The night-cap was carrot cake. While the burrata and the pasta dishes lived up the astronomic standards and memories, the vegetables and carrot cake were slightly off last night. This is on the high side of picky, but I preferred the balsamic based dressing for the veggies as opposed to the more creamy one served. I still loved it, and enjoy pushing my flavor palate, but my preferences are what they are. The carrot cake was also tasty with none left over for the dishwasher, but it had a slight feeling of dryness or less than fresh. In both cases the quality still prevailed and did not detract one bit from the rest of the meal. The fries are to deadly and worth it, the unbelievably seasoned rabbit confit is a dish I could 10 times over and it's hard to stop at one portion of the melt-in-your-mouth burrata. Maybe next time I should step out a little farther on the plank and try some new dishes, but it's so hard when your favorites are just too good to pass up.
