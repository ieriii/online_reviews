I kind of hate the hippy name and image thing ("Peace man, totally uniting the world one thin crust pie at a time") but Piece is kind of a fun place to be at the right time. For starters, Piece, what happened to your pizza? I remember coming here last year and having a pretty memorable dining experience. I came recently and it was like getting Domino's! What happened? It wasn't bad really but it just wasn't great like I remember. Also I remember the guacamole being a lot tastier. Given that, the one thing that never has let me down and my main source of praise for Piece is because of their beer. It seems like every other restaurant with a brewery attached to it has some kind of Beer World Cup award attached to one of their menus to the point where it seems like they're giving these things out like candy. I think very few of these are deserving of their braggart claims but Piece has great beer. The Surrender is a great Belgian/Saison type of ale that I would be more than happy to drink in excess. The Big Black Mariah is a great porter with lots of flavor and Dark Hefeweizen is faithful to the German beer style as well. The service is ok though at times some of the workers seem to have way too much to do, or be rather entertained talking to other employees.  The place can be an absolute madhouse on the weekends, so I'd suggest coming early or on a weekday night. Sunday's ain't too bad.
