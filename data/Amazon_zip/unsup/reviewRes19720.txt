I think I would recommend this place more for the atmosphere than the sushi.  The quality of the fish was decent, and they have a decent sized selection. However, it just didn't blow me away.  I had the White Dragon, the Japanese Relief Sushi (w/ shiitake tempura..white tuna,avacado etc etc), Spicy Crunchy Tuna, & the Rainbow Roll.  I can understand why people may say that isn't filling, and that's because they use a lot less rice than most restaurants, which isn't a bad thing. I think the problem for me though was the flavor of the sushi rice. .it was too bland.  Sushi rice plays a hugggee role in the taste of the rolls, and when a restaurant has the recipe down.. then even the simple tuna maki roll can be amazing. Everyone says the White Dragon is the best, etc etc..but I think there was too much eel sauce to actually enjoy the roll. Out of all the rolls I had..i would recommend getting the roll on Specials ..specifically for the Japanese Relief. I never had shiitake in my roll before, and it was actually pretty good~ The Spicy Crunchy TUna & Rainbow roll...were just alright. Once again..these rolls would be great compared to other good sushi restaurants if they just had the sushi rice down. If you smother your sushi in soy sauce, then I don't think it would be a problem. Our bill came out to be a little over 60 bucks with tip, and we left still hungry.  I wouldn't mind coming back if I happened to be in the area, but it definitely did not make my favorites list.
