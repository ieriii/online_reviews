The fact that I had to pay for parking for this joint pisses me off. The fact that I had to be put on the waiting list for about 30 minutes pisses me off. The fact that I actually had this place on my list to try pisses me off - what's up with the freaking HYPE?! I got their 'Special Sandwich,' which comes on a ciabatta bread, weirdly marinated strips of 'beef tenderloin' that had no ounce of peppercorn on it, drippy horseradish mayo, and too much freaking parsley; and a side of their 'hash browns' (which happens to have too much dill and needed to be doused in ketchup to actually have some flavor). I should have gotten the pancakes, but I wasn't really in a 'sweet' mood, but more for 'savory.' My friend had the BBQ chicken salad, and that seemed okay (she stated that it was fine). The service needed to be a bit more efficient since I had to ask for condiments.
