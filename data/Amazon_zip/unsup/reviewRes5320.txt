"I like it when I like a place so much that I look forward to coming back before I leave." Those are my wife's words about Purple Pig and I don't think I can say it better than that. When we got there about 6:45 on a Saturday night, the place was nearly full, except for two seats at the counter. From there, we could see everything being prepared from right next to the spot where the servers pick up the food. It took a couple of courses for us to realize how lucky we were to have such a good vantage point. The cooking staff, including the head chef (present throughout) clearly took pride in their work and seemed to really care whether my wife and I enjoyed our food. We enjoyed the deviled eggs and seared quail the most. The mortadella spread, which is on toast with pistachios, was also very good. I recommend those three. We also had the feta and watermelon radish salad, which was good but leaves a spot in our line-up for next time. Surprisingly, the Wagyu sirloin was our least favorite of the night. I never thought I would say that about nearly Kobe-quality beef. Maybe I'm just not a Kobe guy. From our spot by the server station, we saw several other dishes that looked delicious, particularly the pig's ear with fried egg on top and the beet salad. The next time we're there, we will definitely have to try those.
