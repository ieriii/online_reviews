It simply amazes me that people can actually rave about this place as if it's the best thing since sliced bread. Having grown up in Pilsen, my family, friends and I have known of this place since the early 80's and we all agree that it is the most overrated (and politically connected) business in Pilsen. Everything from the tacky facade paint job, to the mediocre tasting food, to the indifferent almost rude servers, this place does not aim to please it's customers at all. Yet once a year for the last 12 years or so and mainly out of support for my old community, I give this place a visit hoping it's finally worth recommending. The decor still lacks warmth, the refried beans are still greasy and overcooked and the miserable waitresses are still indifferent to the customers needs. The last time we visited we ordered the carne asada dish and it took the waitress almost 10 minutes to finally inform us that they were out of carne asada. (On a wednesday afternoon?) When we finally ate our meal, we once again agreed hands down that there are so many better places to eat in Pilsen. Let me just put it this way, if Chef Ramsey ever got his hands on this place he would simply tear it apart from top to bottom.
