I've been around to Revolution a handful of times since moving here last spring, and I can confidently say that the food, beer and service are solid. I always like the try one of the limited offer brews, as they do come up with some pretty curious beers. But of course, I like trying something a little different. More than anything, I appreciate their HAVING veg options. For a gastropub, it's commendable. Being a vegetarian, I'm pretty flexible about how much I expect to be amazed, seeing as the menu is mostly for omnivores. That being said, I feel like their kitchen could take their veg food more seriously. My tempeh reuben was...okay? I've certainly had better elsewhere. My last couple of veg dishes there were similarly meh. I've tried the seitan sausage pizza (with Upton's seitan), and the tofu chili dog. Both are, again, decent. But it's more like, I can live with it, because I'm here for the beer, and at least there's something I can nibble. Oh, and get the cheddar ale soup! That's one item that will never disappoint!
