At The 3rd Coast Cafe, better-than-average diner fare awaits your empty stomach. I will have to save a longer review for a more indulgent experience, but from the standard items I did order, I can say that I was pleased. It was a nice choice to have gazpacho on the soup list, although it wasn't very exciting. My soup accompanied a veggie sandwich and I was so happy that they offered something vegan by nature, offering hummus as the main spread in place of the usual mayo, or for you fancy types, some rendition of aioli. It may not have been something to write home about, but again, I'll save my longer review for a more thorough investigation of their menu. Service was above average and overall friendly. I'll make it a point to stop here again the next time I'm in the Gold Coast and need a quick bite. OH - I almost forgot! It says "no cell phones" on the menu, as a courtesy to other guests, I believe. That's a noble pursuit... I didn't happen to notice if there were any violators present. I'll check that out next time, too.
