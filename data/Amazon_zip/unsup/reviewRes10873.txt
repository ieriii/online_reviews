Taking into account ambiance, price, food and beer, this is probably my favorite pizza place in Chicago. It scores bonus points for having Rick Nielsen from Cheap Trick as one of the co-owners.  For starters, it's refreshing to go to a pizza joint that doesn't look just like Gino's/Uno/Giordano's, etc. No red and white plastic tablecloths here. It's a great, open space with perfect lighting and a hip yet unpretentious feel.  The pizza, especially for thin crust, is out of this world. Usually I'm not the biggest thin crust guy, if for no other reason that being from Iowa, I like a LOT of food, and it usually doesn't fill me up. But the pizza here....wow. I thought I would like the 'white' pizza better, but surprisingly the plain ole 'red' pizza won out, hands down. The key is to not get too many toppings, as that can make even the strongest think crust pizza soggy under all that pressure.  My only complaint is that the appetizers could be better. But that is offset by their great beer selection, all of it brewed in-house. And on Sunday nights they have 'live karaoke'. High five! A great place to start the night or take out of towners weaned on Pizza Hut and Dominoes.
