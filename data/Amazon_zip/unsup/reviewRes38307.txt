As a Chicago tourist, I was really excited to finally get a taste of the "deep-dish" pizza that everyone raves about when visiting the "Windy-City". We arrived at Giordano's and were immediately seated. I guess this is a pretty big deal since they are usually overly crowded and backed up on pizza orders. The hostess suggested that the next time we visit, we order in our pizza selection by phone before we arrive, that way we won't be waiting 40-60 mins. for our pizza to arrive! (Good suggestion). We had a great waiter with excellent customer service and knowledge of the menu and mix-and-match options (if you can't eat a small pie by yourself). He warned us that the pizza would take about 45 mins. to bake. It DEFINITELY took that long - my family and I were starving so, we ordered appetizers -- pretty tasty. Finally the pizza's arrived and boy did they look HUGE. It was a new experience eating pizza with a knife and a fork, but totally necessary for these deep dish devils. The ingredients were excellent but, there was one thing that caught me completely off guard -- THE PIZZA WAS A BIT COLD! Now, I'll admit, I love my pizza fresh and hot right off the pan but, our pizza's were ... mildly warm! After taking 45. to bake, you would think that they would arrive piping hot but alas, they were not. Huge bummer. We didn't mention it to the waiter because we didn't want to be those annoying "out-of-towners" so we happily plowed into our deep dishes. Like I mentioned before, the quality and taste of the pizza's were great. Just wish they were piping hot, but maybe that's just a personal preference of mine? Overall, good pizza. Not the bang I was expecting but, definitely filling and relatively inexpensive.
