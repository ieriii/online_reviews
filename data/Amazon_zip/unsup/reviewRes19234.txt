"You've never been to the Gage?!? I have been hearing statement quite frequently from friends, co-workers, even my hairstylist. So when my husband and I were free last Friday - we figured, this is it. THIS is the night we're going to go to the Gage. So we did. And we elbowed our way through the masses to the bar for a pre-dinner cocktail. And we stood there for over an hour - getting bounced by waiters walking by and couples on first dates canoodling. The bar space was not fit to handle the amount of Friday night patrons waiting to get seated. I was disappointed by the tiny specialty cocktail list. The Gage Cocktail I ordered, which I assume to be the signature drink, was below average. Anyways, they were late seating us for our reservation. However, the manager did offer to comp our next round of drinks for being so patient. Thank you, Mr. Manager. At this point - we were famished. We had seen a lot of trays with mussels during our wait, so we figured that would be a good start to the meal. It was a solid choice; the mussels were awesome in a tasty broth that I almost drank out of the bowl. I ordered the Duck Confit based on the high praise from the waitress. My husband got the Fish and Chips. Both entrees were okay. I certainly I didn't think the duck was worthy of the rave recommendation. And the Fish & Chips tasted like your typical bar food. Perhaps we ordered wrong. Perhaps the Gage has been so highly talked up by people that it just couldn't meet our expectations. Either way, we left slightly bummed. Moral of the story: Order the mussels. Avoid the bar crowd masses.
