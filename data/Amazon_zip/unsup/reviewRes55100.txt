My wife and I always come here for special occasions as well as just for a night out on the town. This place has great food, but especially known for their steaks. I like the blue cheese crusted filet and my wife always gets the walnut crusted halibut. We usually split a salad or appetizer. My wife likes the desserts, which I sometimes will dabble a little in. The drinks are always good here as well. I've also planned a bachelor party dinner here as well, which turned out great. The service was awesome and couldn't have had a better time.
