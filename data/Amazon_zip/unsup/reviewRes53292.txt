AMAZING!!!!  I've been to quite a few gastronomy driven restaurants...some have been mind blowing...some not. But Alinea was beyond!  It's days later and I'm still trying to tell everyone I see about our experience. But how can you really give justice t this whole presentation? I CAN'T!!! From the seaweed driftwood presentation, antioxidant elixer served in a huge chunk of ice, our desert having liquid nitrogen poured into it right on the table and then smashed into pieces by the owner of the restaurant himself to make an amazing mixture on the silicone tablecloth, to the peppermint snow and delicious morsels served on the end of a foot long wire...I'd have to say this was the most amazing place I've ever eaten at!  Our waiters ranged from normal to pretentious...but whatever...the food was amazing. The presentation..amazing....the decor( especially when you walk into the hallway from the street....amazing... the attention to detail....amazing! I would definitely be back because this place is freakin AMAZING!!!!!
