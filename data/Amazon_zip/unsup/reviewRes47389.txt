To be fair...if it was my scene it could have gotten 4 stars. It's just the music was way too loud. This place just opened literally down the street for me. So I had to go check it out. I'm not sure if you would classify it as a metal bar or not. There was probably at least 10 tv's in there playing music video's. It's a cool concept. The food was very good and our service was awesome. At one point my scarf fell on the floor and the bouncer came over and picked it up for me. The servings were huge, in fact I had to take some of my food to go. Not a ton of options if you don't eat meat. I did have mac and cheese as a side and it was super awesome. I would go back to eat. We were there around 7 on a Saturday night and we got there right before the rush. It is new so I'm not sure if the will die down. One great thing it that it is across from the empty bottle so it might be a good place for music heads to get something to eat before a show. Ohh..and I almost forgot. Great beer list with great prices!
