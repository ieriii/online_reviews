I love Fox & Obel! It's a great place to grab lunch and shop for awesome specialty foods. The sandwiches and salads are great, and the selection is exciting (especially for a south sider like me). When I went the first time they had a woman there promoting her own gourmet chocolate company. These chocolates had been handed out at the Oscars, and I think I am a better person for having tasted them.
