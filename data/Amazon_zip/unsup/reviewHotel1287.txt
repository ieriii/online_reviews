They are super kid friendly at The Ritz-Carlton Chicago, and color me impressed: from check-in to check-out, this Four Seasons Chicago extension felt pitch perfect throughout. And I don't know why this isn't the norm, but it was really amazing to stay at a top flight hotel without feeling like the little one was an extra burden. She went everywhere we went, and they could not have been more accommodating. Some interesting sidebars: as the Ritz is right off Michigan Ave, even though you're in tourist central there's loads of shopping nearby if that's your thing, and some great restaurant options as well. I especially liked the idea that they'll rent an iPad 2 to you for twenty bucks a day if you want some high tech help seeing the city, and were it not for the fact that my face is usually affected by the pallor of my computer screen all too often, I'd have rented one, too. The lounge is spacious, opens up to the panoramic windows besides, and the service was prompt without looming. But in the end, often these stays are about the rooms themselves, and the one we stayed in couldn't have been more comfortable. Request a lake view if you can.
