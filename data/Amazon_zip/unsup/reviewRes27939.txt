Another work event brought me to Frontera Grill. Sometimes, I'm just really lucky. There were nine of us, and at least at my end of the table, we all had a great time. A couple of cerviche appetizers, some guacamole, some habenero salsa and a few margaritas (or mojitos, in my case) started the night off right. One of us in the group, and recently eaten at Topolobampo and raved about the sommelier, and since four of us happened to order the grill-roasted pork loin served with classic Pueblan pork tinga, we thought we'd ask the sommelier for a recommendation on wine. As soon as we asked, her eyes lit up and we knew we were in for a treat. The Spanish Rioja Reserva was fantastic and, for once, I feel like it actually heightened the experience. We truly had a great time, ate great food, drank great wine and even had Rick Bayless sitting at the table next to us for a time. All in all, I definitely want to go back and I would love to try Topolobampo.
