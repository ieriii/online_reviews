This was the very first evening dinner I had in Chicago. We brought two bottles of wine and had a group of 7. To our luck, we were seated right away and ended up ordering a handful of the appetizers and a dish each. Quick Tips: -For appetizers my favorites out of the ones we ordered were the Choripan and the Shrimp Empanada. SO GOOD. -For entrees, the pork is really good and the Pargo(fish) is tasty but it's HUGE! -DONT FORGET THAT ITS BYOB and the patio is WONDERFUL during the summer. Our evening outdoors was great since the weather was beautiful.
