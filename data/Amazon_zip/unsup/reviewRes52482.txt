I had a wonderful time at Brazzaz during my trip to Chicago. At $45 a pop, it was still definitely worth it. The "salad" bar included items such as super fresh oysters, manchego cheeses and serano ham. Aside from the endless servings of meat (beef, pork, lamb, chicken, sausage, shrimp etc..), the place gives side orders such as fried bananas and polenta. The wine selection was also well chosen. The waitor comped our desert and coffee and provided exceptional service through out the whole evening. (I guess comping is common in Chicago to the surprise of this Bostonian). My one complaint is that the hostess did not mark that we honored our OpenTable reservation.
