There's so many mixed reviews! like a good friend said, in the end, it's your own perception that really matters. There I was on a business trip, there in the windy city during a time when it wasn't so fun to walk around the windy city, the wind was really biting into my cheeeks - I was hungry AND craving for pizza + I had some money to burn so I decided to drop by. The place is packed, like beer or dogs, the attendants really suck at customer service, its no wonder the world has to come up with HOSPITALITY schools. WTH? Anyway, the pizzas are good enough by themselves, lots of cheese and.. bread. that's what the crust seemed to resemble at least, i prefer it like pita, maybe it was, but the small pita bread things i tasted elsewhere might be better. The cheese, the mushroom and other toppings are ok. All in all , the pizza was filling, but kinda bland, I've done Yellow Cab which isn't deep dish, but has more flavor, I can say that Sbarro's is a bit better with their deep dish pizzas. I was satisfied because of the portions and I was hungry but with the flavor and level of service, I might be inclined to keep on the hunt for the best deep dish pizza of chicago, before this nice business trip of mine ends. Any recommendations?
