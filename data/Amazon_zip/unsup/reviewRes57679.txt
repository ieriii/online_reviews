I can never go back after seeing how some of the wait staff handled the food before serving it to the customer. I was sickened as I saw hands touching the food on the plate because the food was sliding a little off the plate. Overall, the restaurant is in need of some remodeling and it doesn't look clean at all. Cleanliness is my number 1 priority when going to a restaurant but apparently it isn't theirs.  If I could give it no stars I would. The food was bad too. Let's just say the rest of the evening was not pleasant to say the least.
