I really enjoyed my time here! We had a brief wait which was not bad but a bit chilly because the bar is directly in path of the door. It all worked out because we were seated quickly in a warm locale in the back. The delicious warm bread was some of the best I have had in ages! I would have eaten more but I did not want to embarrass myself. I did have a small complaint...the ceaser salad left a little to be desired. The dressing is made by the chef but to be honest I could not tell the difference between it and Italian dressing. Oh and you can tell the salad was dressed early in the evening because the croutons were soft. My food was so wonderful. I ordered the shrimp and broccoli pasta dish..it was so delicious. It was filled with shrimp and so satisfying. In fact I had to take more than half home. It reheated well. My friends orders the lobster pasta and it was equally as tasty...just a bit richer! My other friend got the rigatoni caprese and we all loved it. It was very fresh. I would really recommend this place. We did not order any wine but I did notice that they had organic wine!
