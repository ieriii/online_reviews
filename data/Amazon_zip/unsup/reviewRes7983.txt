3.5-3.75+ I liked the restaurant and setting. The food was fresh, we ordered, all different pizzas. We just expected it to be crisper and not as soggy in the middle. But we loved the staff, owner and atmosphere. Maybe since we are new to that kind of pizza. Def come here on a date and try the pizza! Just don't expect crunchy pizza bread pizza. They are crowded so def get a reservation. Salads, beverages, service 4.0 : ) Pizza for me 3.5
