Service was horrible. We waited more than 30 minutes for a table, even though we had a reservation. The food was mediocre at best, and was almost room temperature. I had the strip steak with rice and beans. Best thing they served us was the guacamole and homemade chips. Very colorful decor, nice to look at, but didn't create a real ambiance of fun. Server was hard to get a hold of at times as well. We paid about $80 for two people, way overpriced for what we were served. Definitely would not go back.
