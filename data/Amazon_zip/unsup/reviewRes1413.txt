Hot Doug's is one of the things that makes life beautiful. They serve hot dogs and gourmet hot dogs in just about any imaginable form they come. The chef there is very creative and the restaurant is clearly the work of his passion: encased meats. It's small, in a desolate location, and there is always a line. Even when it's cold, people stand outside to eat these links. The seating is ample and turns over quickly. The place is decorated in red, yellow and blue with Hot Dog memorabilia covering the walls. The regular menu includes a good set of basics which can be dressed up or down. There's a Chicago style hot dog, bratwurst, thuringers, spicy links, corn dogs, veggie dogs, chicken sausages, the list goes on and on. The fries are very good, and on Fridays and Saturdays they offer duck fat fries. There are specialty sodas and fountain drinks available. They have daily specials, including a game special. Sometimes, it's a bison link, sometimes rattlesnake. And the toppings are perfectly coordinated to match the meat selection. My favorites so far have been the game special Bison hot dog with whatever heavenly toppings he recommended that day and the Sante Fe style chicken sausage with brown mustard, tomatoes and carmelized onions. My boyfriend likes the occasional pork hot link special, with coca-cola bbq sauce, the thurginer and the brat. The only drawbacks to the place, which are perfectly forgivable since the food is so good, are the long lines, that it's cash-only, and that it's hard to get to if you've got a 9-5 job. Hot Doug's hours are tight. Whenever I ever get a weekday off, I try to go and gorge myself silly.
