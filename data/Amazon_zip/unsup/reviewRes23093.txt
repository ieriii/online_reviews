Things I love about Irazu: 1. Palmito salad. SO good. The lime dressing is fantastic. 2. Oatmeal shake. It's like a liquid cookie. It's unique and wonderful. 3. Great chips for the table. 4. Really nice atmosphere with the outdoor flame heaters and casual feel. While it's not the cheapest place around, I find it really high quality and delicious.
