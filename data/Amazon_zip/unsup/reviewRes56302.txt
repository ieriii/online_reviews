Coming from the Bay Area, neck high in Pho restaurants, I was desperately searching for a Pho fix. Luckily I found Simply it. The Pho is good (beef is better than its chicken) and they delivery ($3 charge) to pretty far distances. I live near the Water Tower and they're up in Lincoln Park. The owner Tuan is incredibly nice and energetic. He really care's about providing a good product and great customer service. Their Beef Pasta (Bun Bo Xao) is great and its a lunch special. Check out their lunch specials first for a good introductory. Oh, and their Fisherman's Soup is good too (don't let the name deter you). Best and only Pho in downtown Chicago ... I've been incredibly satisfied every time! Bon appetite!
