My favorite restaurant in all of Chicago.. Yes its a chain but I honestly have never had a filet mignon like they serve at Ruths Chris. Very expensive but worth every penny. The filet mignon is so good that if you havent been already, you MUST experience the taste or you will be missing out on filet mignon the way that it was intended to be eaten.
