Owner: Great! Food: Great! Wait staff: Very cute and also great! Prices: More than reasonable It's a rock bar. Yes it does get loud sometimes. It's a rock bar. Went for dinner a couple times now though and noise level has been fine. Easily could visit with my friends as Maiden played on in the background. So awesome! Seriously check this place out and check their website. For some of you non-rockers Sundays seem to be a bit mellower. Owner is also very accomodating if you have a request for a specfic band/dvd you'd like to see sometime.  Food: So far I've had the eggplant sandwich on ciabetta. Liked it. Than I had the burger. Soooo gooood!! Pretzel roll, mild cheddar, bacon, and a really good, zesty bbq sauce. Sided with the mac and cheese. Burger is definitely a standout (and no 3 hour wait). The mac and cheese uses special imported cheese direct from Ireland. At first taste not what you expect. Very subtle flavors. Than you keep eating and it gets better, better, and better. Must try.  Cheers guys...job well done!
