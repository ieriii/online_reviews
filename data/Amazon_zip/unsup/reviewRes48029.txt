I came back here and loved my food even more! After noticing that the menu changed, I was a bit worried that everything was a bit too out there--but I stepped out of my comfort zone and was pleasantly surprised. We shared the almond chocolate banana bread which was good, but I liked the coffee cake much better. We also shared the eggs and focaccia with salad and beef salami and the arctic char salad. Both were out of this world! Publican does not disappoint!
