Recently my best friend came to visit and I was very excited to bring her here. Unfortunately our experience was not what we had anticipated. We had a pretty large party however it was on a weekday and the place was half empty. We had 3 kids w/us and a month old, which was evident by the look on the hostess face that kids weren't quite welcome. We insisted that we didn't mind if we sat in two different tables in order to make it easier on them (it was 8 of us total). She told us to wait outside while they put our tables together. Mind you, I understand this is normal for them to ask but it made no sense since they had no customers waiting in line and the entire front section was empty. We wouldn't have mind had it been above 50 degrees, if we didn't have a baby and had she not had that look of annoyance on her face. Needless to say we left and went down the street to cafe con leche where we were greeted w/a smile on their face. Yes the food may be great at bongo but I think great customer service and a smile wins by far. Unfortunately I will not be returning to this place and neither will a few other people who have had the same treatment even w/o kids.
