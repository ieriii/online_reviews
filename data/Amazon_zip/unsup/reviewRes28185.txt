meh...I was SO excited to check out Graham Elliot, and was let down when I go there. The food was just OK, and I left underwhelmed. They diddn't really do anything wrong, but for $180 bucks for two people I want to be impressed. The pork belly with root beer sauce was the only real stand-out to me. The rest was just so-so.
