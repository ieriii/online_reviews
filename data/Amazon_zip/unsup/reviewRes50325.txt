I ate here for a late sunday lunch and sat outside. Because I didn't even step foot into the place, I can only review the food and service. (and a little outdoor ambiance.) First of all, there is ample outdoor seating and plenty of good people-watching in the neighborhood. I appreciate that the menu was professionally designed. Truth be told, I liked the visual impact of the menu a lot more than the selections presented on the menu. I finally settled on the mac 'n cheese...it was wonderful. My totally hot girlfriend had the chicken sandwich and she said it was delicious. The server was friendly but a bit slow. Overall it was a good place for an outdoor lunch, I just wish the menu had a few more selections available.
