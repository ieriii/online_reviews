When you walk into Noon O Kabab you will notice, right away, that it is a beautiful and bright restaurant. The food is fine, but, left me wanting more. I ordered a combination plate that had a serving of grilled chicken (that was perfectly seasoned) and also grilled sirloin with an order of white rice. The meats are soft, have spice and are delicious. However, the meal overall was missing something. Maybe a sauce or vegetable to compliment the taste of meat and rice. In the end, I enjoyed my dining experience and you will too. Enjoy!
