I was generally not impressed by Giordano's. I was in town shooting a short film for a few weeks and the producer insisted on ordering Giordano's because he KNEW it was the best pizza in Chicago, and clearly we all know that producers generally know EVERYTHING. That being said, the pizza itself was somewhat lackluster in appearance, taste and texture. The crust was quite lacking in crispness and flavor, sort of a bland wheat crust that merely held everything together. It had a greasy taste to it as well, like cardboard with canola oil slathered on it. The sauce was applied in a very thin layer, and was barely present in the overall taste of the pie and the fats in the cheese really overpowered any acidity in the tomato sauce. So it tended to not cut through overall and would certainly be overlooked (not tasted) if you were to eat it blindfolded. Not only was the pizza not really great, half the crew on set, including myself, had serious gastric disturbances after eating Giordano's, which slowed down our working speed. Goes to show you producers are generally full of shit. I'm not sure if he got diarrhea like the rest of us, but I sure hope so. In short, if you're looking for incredibly dense, bland, slab of fat and cardboard, this is your place. Otherwise, save yourself the hassle and head over to Lou Malnati's.
