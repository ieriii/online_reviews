What can I say that hasn't been said already? Nothing. This place would be an automatic 6 or 7 stars if it wasn't always overrun by hipsters. People say the wait it epic. It is... that's why I go on Thursdays. You still wait a little bit but at least you don't pay for your first beer with a Social Security check. Heh, that last line was funny not in the way I used it, but in thinking I or anyone in my generation will actually ever see a Social Security check... HA! I digress. This place is awesome from head to toe. The beer selection is so amazing. I like the list of 750ml bottles. The food is always spot on. It's also a very chill place to relax and really enjoy your meal and drinks. It is on my list of places to take my brother as soon as he moves to Chicago. Great place.
