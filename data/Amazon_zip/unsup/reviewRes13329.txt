I met the beautiful Jelena Z here for breakfast, finally. I had been wanting to try breakfast here ever since I came here for lunch many weeks ago. Many tempting options, but I settled on the 4 egg omelet with provolone and spinach. A few nice things, its 4 eggs! I'm usually pretty starving by morning, (Andy F can attest to my eating skills at breakfast), so it is nice to see something a little more than 3 eggs. Also, tending to be on the healthier side, you can go for all egg whites for a small up charge. Even better, you can get a side stack of pancakes instead of toast for another small up charge. By small up charge, I mean a little more than a buck which I think is fair. Jelena went with an egg sandwich, which I love, but didn't feel was going to be enough for me. I have to say I was a little disappointed with the omelet, in terms of, it was a little too buttery for my liking. I tend to go for drier eggs, but it was still big, full and filling. It also came with a seasoned potato pancake, although not too crispy, it was really flavorful, I think with chives and Parmesan cheese. The pancakes were wonderful though, a hint of vanilla, not too dense but not too light, but just right. Jelena seemed to like her sandwich, scrambled eggs with some cheddar, but some thick sliced multigrain. Maybe it would have been filling enough... ahh I will stick by my choice. I do have to agree with some others, the host, whom I am guessing might be Glenn, might never smile. I don't mind, but next time I am going for the French toast or just the straight up pancakes... or that really good looking egg sandwich...
