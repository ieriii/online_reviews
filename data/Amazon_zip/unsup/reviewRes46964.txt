The food is always impressive here. It's one of those spots to take out of town friends when you want a sure bet on amazing food with a relaxed environment and good crowd, for not a lot of dollars. I'd say it's comfort food, but when I hear that I don't necessarily picture the level of deliciousness and originality this place serves up. From the beer selection, to the sides and of course the mains, down to the environment, I've enjoyed every single trip here.
