This has been my favorite jazz spot since I turned 21. Being an avid jazz lover and aficionado, I can never get sick of this place. I've seen many of my college music professors perform here....Orbert Davis, Ari Brown just to name a few .... and it's always been a delight. If you're expecting to find a drink menu, forget it! That's what makes this place unique. I have to say I have noticed a younger crowd there my last few times. It seems to me they are there just because of the history of the place instead of admiration for the music. I could be wrong, but just my observation. If you want good seats, get there early for a top notch performance, otherwise, find yourself standing or at the bar where Jason will serve you up your favorite drink! Parking directly west a block away, on Lawrence is always a plus given the nature of that area.
