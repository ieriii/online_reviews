Ever since I moved out to Chicago I've never had good pho anywhere I went..seriously what the pho?! Where can i get a decent bowl of Pho & Bun Cha? I think I've finally found a place!!! I ordered Bun Cha w/ beef & shrimp..soo good w/t he vermicelli & veggies. Also ordered up a "Baby Pho" so it was a smaller sized portion of the beef brisket pho. The broth had a good base to it..unlike most places in the city where the pho I've ordered usually turns out to be bland. The fried eggrolls are good too & they have a good selection of Banh Mi & rice dishes, if you want something to go w/ your pho. Decent prices...good food..me likey. The place does get pretty crowded so some people have to share tables w/ other parties; no biggie.
