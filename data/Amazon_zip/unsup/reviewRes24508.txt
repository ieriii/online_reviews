I just want to say "You guys, SUCK!" Before I came over today's evening , I pretty liked this place.... Mostly because you can get together here with friends and don't feel pressure to order something else or to eat faster...You can be slow as a service here. It was a huge rain today, my friends and me decided to have a dinner at this place and just chat over couple glasses of wine. When we arrived the man at the door (kind of "Host") ask us to put umbrellas near place that looked like a garbage can. I asked him to keep my umbrella because it is black, and I didn't want to lose it during this weather. The man said " No, you have to put you umbrella here! Everything is gonna be fine!" Ok... When I came back after dinner I did NOT find my umbrella, and those guy was just incredibly RUDE. When I politely pointed to him that they lost my umbrella, he almost cried to me "I' m not responsible for your personal things!!!' I asked him what I 'm supposed to do and he yelled ' You can take mine!!!! But you have to bring it back today because it's raining and I need them! " After that he just showed me his broad back and threw used glass in a garbage . Thank you Sir, for you kind respond! I hope I NEVER EVER see your face and especially your back again because I'm sick of Artopolis and how they've treated permanent customers. Well, I ended up going to Wallgreens and buying a new umbrella. I didn't ask to see a manager just because I didn't want to ruin my friends evening and simply didn't have time.
