I eat here weekly. Usually it's late afternoon lunch, sometimes weekend brunch. I have not been here for dinner, yet. The lunch sandwiches are awesome. My first time here I was disappointed that they didn't have French Fries, so I 'settled' for the potato pancake. Wow! Amazing potato pancake! My kids (5 and 7) are welcome there, and treated pretty 'special' by the staff. It's not 100% a kids place, or family place, but they are so friendly and welcoming that it doesn't make a difference. They have a huge selection of cereal behind the bar and sometimes the kids will have that for lunch. Despite the wonderfully varied menu, I almost always get seafood. It's always fresh. If it's not fresh they take it off the menu for the day.  I take everybody I know here for lunch. Vegetarians, bacon-lovers, everybody. Everybody leaves 100% happy.
