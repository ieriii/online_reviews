Wildfire is what you make it. It can be a better than average experience, or an exceptional one. I have never had a bad meal there and while service has been uneven, find a waiter that you love and ask for him/her by name. You will be glad you did. The bartenders open up if you make the first move and the staff in the front has improved in the last several weeks. You don't have to go to Morton's to get a great steak and Wildfire has all the starches and sides you'd expect to find at any great steakhouse. Don't pass on the filets, or the white cheddar potato au gratin. I think desserts have gotten smaller over the years, or maybe I'm just getting larger. Dine smart and look for a table early to mid-week and be sure you reserve a table. Even a 6PM reservation on a Wednesday can be a rare thing. If you dine on Friday or Saturday, expect a wait no matter where you go.
