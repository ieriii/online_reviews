Oh, you know, I've only been to Chicago a gazillion times now and have never tried deep dish pizza. My friends were not only appalled and confused, but did everything in their power to change this. When my friend said that Pequod's is his favorite Chicago pizza, I trusted his judgment and now I know why. The crust is perfect. I was expecting some doughy, yeasty monstrosity. Not even close - the crust is much more porous than I expected, slightly caramelized, and crispy. I also liked that the tomato sauce had a little bit of tartness to it, rather than the sweet or overly salty stuff that is so often slopped on top of pizza crust. There was plenty of cheese, yet the structural integrity of the pizza was not compromised. In summary, all of the ingredients are tasty AND in proportion. Although this was a great slice of Chicago pizza, NY pizza will always reign supreme.* * I am ready to start 2011 with death threats from pro-Chicago pizza Yelpers.
