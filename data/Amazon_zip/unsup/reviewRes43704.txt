This place is a dream! My friend and I strolled over here on a pleasantly warm Friday afternoon. As my friend pointed out, it seemed like we were on vacation. The weather was beautiful, everyone was out walking their dogs, sitting outside of restaurants, and generally in an easy-going mood. The wrath of winter had FINALLY settled, and everyone took advantage of it that day. Milk and Honey was just the place to bask in the day's delight. Entering the restaurant, I was set on ordering French toast, but they had stopped serving breakfast already. But that was okay! The avocado sandwich made up for it a million times! Oh my god, my first bite into this veggie treasure was pure bliss. I put the sandwich down and just stared at it in disbelief. What had I just eaten?!!! Let me give you some insight into my usual behavior. I'm comatose most of the time, hardly excited by anything. It's torturous, really. So not only was this sandwich a gift to my stomach, but my mental health as well. This must have been made by a true sandwich god. Let me tell you what was in this--avocado, smoked GOOOOOOUDA cheese, Roma tomatoes, cracked mustard (still don't know what it is, but I'm pretty sure I love it), cucumbers, and all sandwiched between multigrain bread. I've never told a sandwich I loved it before, but everything was different that day. I gave my friend a piece of my sandwich and she gave me some of her salad. Oh what a meal. We were completely enamored by this quaint little cafe. The service was terrific. The cashier was soooo pretty. I don't remember her name, but her face was beautiful.  You must try it! Oh please just go here now!!
