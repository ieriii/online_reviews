One of the best pizza places in Chicago, especially for fans of thin and crispy pizza. I got the White pizza with Chicken and Bacon, and my friend got the Red pizza with basil and mushrooms. Both were delicious. In addition, the beer selection is fantastic. Their "Golden Arm" beer is near perfection. One minor complaint: they offer individual-size pizzas for lunch, but not dinner. This results in each person getting a small pizza, which is way too much food for even those with big appetites. I'd suggest splitting a pizza between multiple people. Overall, though, this is really one of the best pizza/breweries I've been to in Chicago and may jump up to 5 stars on a repeat visit.
