Authentic, spicy food and surprise - great service. We ordered the water boiled beef, pea shoots with garlic, dan dan noodles, and salt & pepper lamb. Every dish was excellent, but I especially recommend the dan dan noodles & water boiled beef. The only danger is your significant other may insist on making the trek to chinatown every weekend after dining here. But I don't think I can complain :)
