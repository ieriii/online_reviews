living near by i frequent alliance for the cupcakes for sure - where else can you get red velvet cupcakes and they are awesome - they have wonderful baked goods and their larger cakes are out of this world - in the morning i USED to like stopping by for all the hotties on the way to work - but the negative snarky attitude of the staff is a major put off - well now is a great time to start my carb free diet -and now there is sweet cakes and i just found Bleeding Heart YUM
