Many people seem to think that crepes are only for sweets, but the savory crepes you can get at Icosium are wonderful. I had the Marrakesh (sp?) and my wife had the house specialty. I can't remember everything in it, but there were sultanas (golden raisins), fresh mint, caramelized onion and more - absolutely lovely. The house crepe is made with goat's cheese, spinach, pine nuts, cilantro, roasted red pepper, etc. My wife was well pleased, as well. After the meal, my wife had the Algerian tea and I had a Turkish coffee. The tea is made with a plethora of fresh mint leaves. The coffee has a slight orange flavor. And for those of you who don't know, don't try to drink to the bottom of the cup when you're having a Turkish coffee!
