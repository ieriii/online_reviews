I honestly don't understand what all the rap about this place is about. My boyfriend and I, two individuals that love to eat good food in the city of Chicago could not have been more disappointed, and be at variance with the majority of food enthusiasts we know. First time we went there was during a Sunday brunch... it was busy. "This...", we thought "...looks promising". We didn't wait that long for a table, but we did wait on our waiter a lot (oh the irony). There were out of everything that we had set our eyes on, not only was she absent a lot but she couldn't even explain to us what they actually DID have on the menu. We waited again. We decided to leave after just a sip of our coffee. My boyfriend asked her if she wanted us to pay for those coffees because we were not interested in eating any of the three things that were available from the menu. Second time it was dinner time. We met up with a friend who had invited us out to this spot - After a few months of our dissatisfaction with the service of this place, we decided to give it another chance and actually try the food that everyone keeps jabbing about....our server this time was not that bad, but she was still talking to us like we didn't fucking know what small plates are - do you realize what kind of people you're serving? People who have worked in the service industry for years (my boyfriend), and who love to go out to eat/dine aka foodies. You don't need to tell us what small plates are, just because we have never ate there, doesn't mean that we have never been to a restaurant with food that serves small plates we can share. I had the burger, because it sounded appetizing at the time - I asked for it to be med-well and it was... pretty well done, which was okay I guess. I was not impressed with the food. Oh and p.s. the hostess was fairly incompetent. Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me. There are better spots in Logan Square.
