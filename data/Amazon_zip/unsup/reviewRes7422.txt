I came here for a birthday party and had a great meal. I ordered the catch of the day (sole) wrapped around scallops, shrimp and squid. It was like a surprise every bite. The side of angel hair pasta with veggies had a very tasty tomato based sauce that brought out the flavors of the veggies and pasta. We tried to challenge the "your water will never be empty" that one of my friends had read on a Yelp review of the place - one person succeeded but the water pitcher was so close behind it's a tough call. My friend had the mussels and didn't really enjoy them. Apparently they weren't very fresh - a little tough, shrunken and smelly. Minus a star.
