If you have celiac or allergies, avoid this place as if your life (or atleast night) depended on it. They had some challenges understanding my dining partner's glutten-free requirements. They brought bread as a side and also on the cheese plate. I ate the side, but had to send back the plate... they brought us back a noticeably smaller cheese plate. My food was tasty for sure. The water guy kept my glass full and we saw him constantly. Our waiter visited us 3 times over an hour and 15 minutes, but he was pleasant. The kitchen clearly had no clue about celiac disease.
