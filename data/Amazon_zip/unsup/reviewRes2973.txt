We went about a year ago and it truly was an experience . . . a very long experience. The meal was an amazing melange of fresh flavors and artistic presentation, but by the end it was a blur. Thank goodness for the print out at the end of the meal describing each course in the tasting menu! We got such a kick out of the service. . . It was like a well rehearsed ballet - each move was choreographed. As dishes arrived at the table they were served in unison and revealed with a flick of the wrist. I have to admit that the service was borderline intimidating and definitely too stuffy for my taste.
