We needed a relatively cheap, central hotel for our vacation to Chicago, and this hotel did just the trick! It sits right on the border of Grant Park, and is only 2 blocks from the El train (which we rode constantly). The room was clean, the people at the front desk were friendly, and I saw some indie band checking out while I was checking in. What more could you want?
