I don't know why people are rating Nana with one or two stars. I thought the service was excellent and the portions were perfect. I think most restaurants give too much, hence contributing to America's obesity problem. Not that I don't like to indulge, but it's nice to eat my entire meal and not feel gross afterward.  I ordered the garden omelette, which was delicious and the vegetables tasted fresh. My husband ordered the nanadict, which he really enjoyed. The spicy apple crepes were perfect - not too sweet and not too much.  It's also family friendly. Enough high chairs for both of my kids and a HEALTHY kids menu! My son had the eggs-a-dilla, which he actually ate! Nice to not have to go to the northside,Hashbrowns (which is just not as good as it used to be), or any other crowded place for brunch.
