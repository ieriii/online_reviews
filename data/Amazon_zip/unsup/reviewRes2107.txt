Look, I don't mean to be contrary. Call me an out of towner, a food snob, whatever. But I understand good eats, and I have eaten enough hot dogs to consider myself a worthy critic. But I am apparently alone in my opinion of these dogs. Like so many foodies, I planned my trip to Hot Doug's months in advance of my stay in Chicago, having seen the virtues of this place touted on various TV food shows. Other than a very friendly Doug at the counter, and the cool "hole in the wall" atmosphere, the experience was a massive disappointment. I had a Chicago Dog, a Chili Cheese Dog, and the Fois Gras dog, and all were usatisfactory. The wieners themselves were tiny and unremarkable. I've had better Chicago Dogs at the Triple A baseball field in SLC. Aren't Chicago Dogs supposed to have sport peppers on them? And what exactly is that cheese made of?? I've gotten suckered into too many bad meals by watching The Food Network. Screw it.
