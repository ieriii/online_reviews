I understood when booking the hotel that it was a two star hotel. I did not expect the Hilton. However, my stay was completely awful. I chose the travelodge because I had stayed there before because of it's location. It is super close the the red line and downtown. However, I would rather walk until my feet fall completely off then ever stay there again. The hotel rooms were disgusting and out-dated -- not to mention the staff was so damn rude. I felt like I was in trouble when I talked to them. I will save up and travel further...I hate the travelodge.
