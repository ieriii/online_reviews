From the outside, I was scared to enter... 90's awning, dirty... But I'm glad I did!! It was such a cool atmosphere with brick walls and a sports bar feeling. We had the cheesy garlic bread and pepperoni pan pizza and had to catch a movie within 1 hour. They made it happen! The food is amazing and super flavorful and service was great!!
