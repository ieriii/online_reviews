I think there must've been a management or chef change within the past 3 years because I went here a couple weeks ago and LOVED it! What I got was pretty basic, but it was perfect. I got a side salad with creamy ginger dressing - the dressing was amazing. I wish I could've bought a bottle to take home with me. I also ordered the pot stickers which were incredible; the perfect harmony of veggies and spices, with just the right amount of crispiness. Next time I'm in Chicago I DEF want to go back; their menu is so big I had a hard time deciding what to order and want to try more things! PS - I am NOT a vegetarian or Vegan; you don't need to be to enjoy this yumminess!
