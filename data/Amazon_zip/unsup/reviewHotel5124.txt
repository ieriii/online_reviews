Three day vacation with 4 year old son and wife. Room was rather small, and the bathroom door was tight to get in to. Stayed in the 'new' tower with a stunning view of Michigan Ave. Room was clean, well laid out and very comfortable. Plasma TV with digital reception was a real plus. All of the staff we encountered were friendly and helpful. Zest restaurant was decent if a bit pricey. You must see the historic Jr Olympic pool (very ornate and a time capsule back 90 years). You are in the heart of all the action. TIP If you are adventurous, use public transit. They have a fantastic system (3 day pass $14). We took train from Midway to Lake Station and bus right to front of hotel in about 40 minutes. Very convenient and efficient.
