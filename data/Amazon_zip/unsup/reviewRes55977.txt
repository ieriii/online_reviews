I would highly recommend my clients and colleagues here in Minneapolis, the Gage Restaurant. We had just minutes before had a not so great experience at the Millenium Park's Park Grill's hostesses. My party of four which were in Chicago for a day trip, spotted the Gage by chance. We were greeted kindly, we were seated immediately, and we received tremendous service. We shared with them nothing about our experience at the Park Grill just minutes before but in some divine way they knew how to be servants. Thank you Gage Restaurant for doing that and sealing our overall impression of Chicago being a great place for a day trip.
