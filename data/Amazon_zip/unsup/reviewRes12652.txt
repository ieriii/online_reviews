I hadn't been to Cafe 28 in awhile, and remember it was much better then than it was today. My frittata was overcooked/dry and lukewarm at best, toast was late and cold, barely any (if any) vodka in my bloody Mary. Service was fine, but when I asked to sub fruit for potatoes, the server told me, 'We're out of fruit.' Seriously? On a Sunday brunch? I'd understand if it was the end of the day, but it was noon. Plenty of time to buy fruit. I remember waiting forever to get in for brunch, but it wasn't crowded today. Maybe the owners should revisit why their lobby isn't packed.
