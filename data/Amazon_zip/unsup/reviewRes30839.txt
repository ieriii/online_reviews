With some friends coming to town we needed to locate a dinner spot that would be able to accommodate six people on what was probably short notice, ok it was more like really short notice since it was two days. Fast forward two days and minus two people from our party we arrived at Mastros. The entrance is very welcoming and had an abundant staff to handle the several groups entering. We were taken to our table which was upstairs and off the beaten path. Here were were introduced to several people who would be taking care of us. All were extremely pleasant and welcoming. We had a couple of drinks then hit the appetizers which were crab cakes and raw oysters. Both were excellent and the oysters were very fresh. For our entrees we all had the bone in filet and our sides included scalloped potatoes and the Gorgonzola mac n cheese, which were equally tasty. We finished up by having their signature desert which is the butter cake. It was very good and large which made it easy to share. All around I would recommend Mastros to someone who was looking for a a good meal, excellent service, and a great ambiance. During the meal we only experience one slight miscue and this was remedied quickly and posed no disruption to our evening.
