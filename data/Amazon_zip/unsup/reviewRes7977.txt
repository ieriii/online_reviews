Agreed that this is a hidden, yummy gem!  As an East Coast girl and a person who grew up on NY-style pizza, I can really only enjoy Chicago's deep-dish and thin-crust "pizza" if I consider it 1) a casserole, in the case of the former or 2) cardboard, in the case of the latter. Sorry my Chicago friends! (You know I am a fan of this truly great city and short of the pizza and your damn dipped beef sandwiches--WTF! Give me a Philly cheesesteak any day--you know I am a lover of all other Chicago foods.) I am an ardent fan of the pizza at Spacca Napoli, folks, and after 1 1/2 years of living in Chicago, I can say that it has even trumped Santullo's in Wicker Park. Santullo's has a true-NY style pizza (that's perhaps a bit runnier than what I grew up on), but it's a much pricier pizza and also the ingredients at Santullo's don't seem as fresh as Spacca Napoli's. However, and be cautioned, my East Coast buddies who have relocated: Spacca Napoli is NOT NY-style pizza. It's Naples-style pizza. AND it's much preferred to any pizza I've had in Chicago. It's so beautifully done--well-balanced, bright sauces, decadent Buffalo mozzarella, fresh herbs, and a great wood-fired crust (the secret is always in the crust, people!). Wow. My Chicago friends and fans of the deep-dish and thin-crust might find the crust at Spacca Napoli a bit thinner than preferred, and runnier, but I suspect those who long for NY-style in Chicagoland will eat these pizzas up in a heartbeat. We're going again to try out other selections, but we were very impressed and immediate fans. I can't wait to bring my husband's cousin from Southern Italy here. Also: Extra star and props to the staff. My husband and I happened to come an hour before they opened for dinner, and they were kind enough to let us in anyway.  Thanks so much for this, Spacca Napoli! Hospitality is always golden, and we felt the love.
