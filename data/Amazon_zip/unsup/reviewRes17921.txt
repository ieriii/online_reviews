After a failed attempt at dining next door, my friend and I were lucky enough to snag a table for 2 at 6:30 on a Friday night. From the moment we were seated until we got out the door, the experience was top notch. Impeccable service. Food that makes me hungry just to think about. And BYOB to boot.  It was especially nice that we were not rushed out after finishing our food, but left to linger over our (already poured) glasses of wine. The only thing keeping this from being a five-star review is $$. Yikes. $20+ for a plate of pasta (or gnocchi in my case) (that doesn't have any meat in it) is pretty steep. But it was delicious and I had plenty to take home for another full meal the next day. While it's a bit pricey to become a regular haunt, I have definitely found a place to return to!
