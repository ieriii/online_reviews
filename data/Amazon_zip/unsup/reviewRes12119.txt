Here is a sure way to attract a crowd (not much of that last Saturday, strangely): pick a trendy culinary ethnicity and attach its name to everything on the menu: a grilled sandwitch becomes Cuban sandwitch, pork chops are dubbed Cuban pork etc. Are they good? Sure. Are they authentically Cuban? Not at all. To call the coffee we had "cuban" is a joke: anyone who has ever been in Miami (not to mention Cuba) will know the difference. But... The food was simple and fresh, Mojitos stiff enough, the waiter seemed genuinely pleasant (and cubanesque), and the patio is cozy and cold-proof. So, all in all, satisfying experience (but don't cancel your trip to Miami for REAL cuban fare.
