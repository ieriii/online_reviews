Let's see.. where shall I begin? The beer is overpriced. You can get the same stuff at half a dozen other places in Chicago and pay less than $8 bucks for a small glass. The atmosphere isn't anything to write home about. Cafeteria meets Elks Lodge in the middle of nowhere Iowa. If you have a problem sitting on top of the people next to you, you will not like this place. I think it would be a good place for groups. The food is pretty good, but a little greasy and too rich for my stomach. Our waiter was not very educated about the menu, and didn't say anything when I inadvertently ordered a side dish as my main entree. I realize that some chicks order salads as their entrees, but I ordered the squash formida (??) which was no more than a 1/2 cup of squash with some lettuce. He really should have let me know that was not going going to fill me up. Luckily, my girlfirend had the ribs and we ended up splitting our meals. I probably wouldn't go back.
