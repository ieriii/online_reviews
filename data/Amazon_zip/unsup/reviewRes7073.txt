We dined here yesterday for lunch as part of Restaurant Week. My first impression: Lovely, lovely white dining room and bar that was very welcoming and warm! Love the attention to detail- fireplace, computer for orders in the bar dining room was hidden in a cabinet, and the chips and pickles that were complimentary prior to the meal.  Service was excellent, helpful, and attentive. Parking was easy in front on the street (not likely to be the case on evenings or weekends). Favorites: Hush puppies (sooooo delicious), mac and cheese (husband loved this). Brisket---love the spices/crust and the fact that it could be cut with a fork. The pablano corn bread was yummy, especially slathered with butter. Decent: The St. Louis ribs were OK but better with the house made sauce slathered on them. The chicken wings had a nice smokey flavor. We got two desserts to go and have yet to try them! Can't wait! We will be back!
