I have to agree with all the other Yelpers about Davanti. The food, service and ambiance was excellent! Since this restaurant is also a wine store, I was able to choose my bottle of wine from the back room. All bottles are reasonably retail priced ($7 corkage fee). After I chose my wine, my BF and I could not wait to sink our teeths into all the food passing by us, as it looked absolutely delectable. We first ordered the charcuterie plate with two cheeses and 3 meats. I have to say the spread was above the average meat and cheese plate, since it also included a fruit jam/chutney of some sort, candied walnuts, sliced gala apples and thin raisin bread crostini. Then we ordered the shaved hearts of palm salad with sweet pepercorns. This was definitely the oddest salad I've ordered, but interestingly very delicious. Being an appetizer lover we decided to order one more and was told by our amazing server Andrew to get the corn salad (shitake mushrooms, walnuts, arugula and Parmesan). I loved that the salad was warm and felt almost like a side dish. By this time I was already full, but we had a pizza and grilled skirt steak still coming. Although I was no longer hungry at this point, the pizza was just too good to pass up. Not greasy, just enough cheese and thin but chewy. The steak was perfectly seasoned with an arugula and tomato salad on the side. Afterward, we received a free desert, had a great conversation with our server and walked away very very full at a reasonable price. All in all, I have to say this is my new favorite restaurant in Chicago. This is a new Italian restaurant, but I feel it falls on the cusp with the New American restaurant waves, due to its rustic yet sophisticated flavors. I walked away from dinner feeling like I went to one of the new hip restaurants that's been given reviews in Food and Wine, yet paid only a fraction of the price.
