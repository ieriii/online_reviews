No more love affair, 90 miles :( Your food and service has gone downhill since last summer and that's disappointing. I will miss your patio tremendously but the last time I was in there was just far too awful for me to return. I'm not sure why your staff isn't as nice as they used to be, considering everyone used to be so friendly. Bring those people back and step up your game guys.
