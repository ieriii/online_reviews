So, my friends Justin and Teresa and I needed food after spending hours playing in the sand at nearby Foster Beach. They suggested Tank Noodle, and at first, I was apprehensive. Vietnamese food, particularly noodle soup, isn't known to be vegetarian-friendly. I thought, if they didn't have any main courses for me to eat, I can settle for an appetizer or smoothie. I skimmed through the menu, and to my delight, there were vegetarian spring rolls and a small selection of vegetarian dishes. I had the the spring rolls ($3.95), which was absolutely tasty and refreshing. Minty, crunchy, and chewy. The accommodating hoisin sauce (with a large squirt of Sriracha) gives the simple appetizer more flavor. I had the egg noodle soup with mixed vegetables. I asked the waitress twice if the broth was vegetarian, not beef. She said yes. I'll take her word for it. The broth was flavorful, but not overwhelming. The vegetables (broccoli, carrots, green beans, etc) were still crisp (not in the "still raw" way). I much prefer egg noodles over rice noodles for noodle soup now. Not only is it easier to eat with its ramen-like texture, but it's a nice contrast to the soup. For $6.95, it is a bargain. Tank Noodle is one of those rare Vietnamese restaurants that offer vegetarian-friendly fare, albeit pricier than the others. I'm not too fond of paying more than $8 for a noodle dish (stir-fried rice noodles and vegetables cost about $10.95). I can take my friends and family here, and not worry about starving. PS: On busy days, they will seat you with strangers. I don't care about this, but if you prefer more privacy by having your own table, the wait will be longer.
