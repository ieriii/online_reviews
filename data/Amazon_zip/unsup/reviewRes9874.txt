i was mildly skeptical after reading some of the mixed reviews, but my experience was pretty great. absolutely no complaints about the service - our waiter was friendly and prompt, and i don't think our water cups were ever less than half full before they were refilled. the ambiance was excellent....dark enough to feel classy and a little elegant, but not so dark it was like they were trying to hide something. i definitely recommend the lychee sangria...it was awesome. as far as food goes, we had banh uot as an appetizer, and shared ca nuong la chuoi and mi xao do bien. all were quite good, but just needed a small something extra to really wow me (hence the 4/5 stars). it is definitely on the expensive side, but worth it for a nice night out or special occasion.
