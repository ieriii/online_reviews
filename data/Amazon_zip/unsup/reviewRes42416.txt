This pizza is delicious. You know where a pizza is so good, you burn your mouth convincing yourself it's cool enough to eat? This was avoided during my visit to The Art of Pizza, thankfully. But, while the skin on the roof of my mouth was spared, my enjoyment suffered for it. Not much, mind you. If the pizza could have been served warmer, I would have been happier. Even more heretical in Chicago: I liked the thin crust better than the thick, stuffed slices.
