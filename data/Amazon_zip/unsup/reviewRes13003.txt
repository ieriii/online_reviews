The interior decor impressed me the moment I entered the restaurant. Although I arrived 30 mins late on a super busy evening, the courteous hostess took only a few minutes to find great seats for us. Their salad/sushi bar offered multiple choices of veggies, fish and sushi. They brought out amazingly tasty steak prepared in at least six different styles. Each style is worth trying at least twice. I must warn you it is a bit pricey but worth every penny. You may be better off picking a bottle of wine instead of their caipirinhas though.
