India house is BLAND. I know I'm a snob when it comes to Indian food. Sorta comes with the territory when you spend four consecutive summers in India. Still, it's not that hard to find decent Indian food in the states. I was trying to decide whether to take my parents here or Indian Garden. I made the judgement solely on the basis that India House served papardi chaat. Bad move. We got to the restaurant, the decor was nice and the waiters were good. They quickly brought us some naan bits and makhani sauce to dip them in. The naan was nice and fluffy, but the makhani sauce was pretty dull. We ordered 1 order of Butter Chicken, 1 order of Dal makhani and the tandoori mixed grill. We also started with the papardi chaat. The chaat was disappointing, poorly mixed and lacking the yoghurt which would have balanced the flavors of the chutneys nicely. The butter chicken was a disappointment. Although I asked the waiter to have it prepared masaledar (spicy), it came out with a tame tomato gravy, without any of the zest the dish is supposed to have. The dal was not bad, but nothing to write home about either. The tandoori mixed grill was boring, too. The garlic naan, however, was pretty good. It definitely had the charred edges indicative of open-flame tandoor cooking, as many places have switched to electric. Finally, the chai was watered down and bland. I don't know if my experience would have been different had I ordered something else, but if a restaurant fails the butter chicken and dal makhani test, I'm not coming back. At the very least it doesn't bode well for the rest of the menu, as these dishes are North Indian restaurants' bread and butter. I'm sure this place is delicious if you've had limited experience with Indian food, but everyone should do themselves a favor and head up to sabri nehari in Devon to see how it really should be done.
