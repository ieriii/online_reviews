The chubby short man at the door who takes peoples names is aggresively rude. I asked him how long the wait would be and he got mad and started yelling at me. Ever seen the soup nazi episode of Seinfeld? This guy is chicago's soup nazi. With all the great restaurants in chinatown, there is no reason to go to a place where the staff are deliberately rude to their guests.
