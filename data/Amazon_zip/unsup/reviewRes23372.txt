$6 for a veggie burrito - the price isn't bad for a HUGE burrito filled with rice, beans, roasted veggies, but it was just so plain. Flavorless and blah. Even the hot chili sauce couldn't give it a kick. The place is wildly popular, so I'm tempted to come in for dinner and actually sit down. Review to be updated... BTW, do you notice a theme in my Chicago reviews? The portions really are bigger than CA's!
