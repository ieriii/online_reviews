Grand Lux Cafe is a fabulous restaurant if you want to dress up, feel lavish, and dine with family/friends/coworkers within a moderate budget. The menu and the ambiance is very similar to the Cheesecake Factory, so it ensures that customers will have a very good time.I do have one warning: If you wear shoes without a grip that can cause you to slide or break your neck, you might not want to wear them there. The tile floors in the restaurant are very very slippery. Wearing heels, I was very happy to have a stair rail and a friend to hold on to.
