If I could I would have given this 2.75 stars. This place is owned by the same company as Cheesecake Factory. The decor, bench design, takeout bags are the same. I ate here with my nephew, sister and mother on New Years Day. We had a very late lunch/early dinner, around 3:00 PM and it was very crowded! Although the restaurant is very large, the bathrooms were very SMALL - the womens room only had five or six stalls! I had to wait in line just to wash my hands. Our waitress was friendly, but we kept having to call her over to our table to receive service. They are either stretched too thin or are very slow. The food was just above average. We must have had a late batch of beignets, because they weren't that tasty unless you dipped it in one of the three sauces they provided. I ordered a pot roast and chicken royale duo. The pot roast was one piece of very dry meat (isn't pot roast suppose to be tender?) atop small amount of vegetables. A huge mash potato serving in the middle, which I admit was tasty. And a flattened, breaded, and fried chicken breast that I will admit was very good. My mother enjoyed an order of ribs and my sister enjoyed a salad. My nephew seemed to have enjoyed chicken tenders and fries. The prices are a on the high side. Our tab was just over $100. Not sure I would go back here again voluntarily.
