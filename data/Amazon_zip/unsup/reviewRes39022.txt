Just went to La Villa for the first time. Atmosphere was a little "old school" but still nice (brick walls decorated with strings of white Christmas lights, tables with leather banquet-style chairs, booths, etc.). I was impressed with the variety of items on the menu. Pasta, chicken, beef, seafood, veal and lamb. I had the king crab legs and my husband had the lamb chops. Both entrees were very good.  Entrees come with soup and salad bar. The soups were nothing special; from a can, I guess. I liked the complimentary focaccia style bread. Portions were large and a good value for the money. Service was very friendly and prompt. It's more of a family atmosphere than a stylish place, but I would go back again.
