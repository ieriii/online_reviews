I have been to the Chicago Diner at least 20 times, and it is solidly delicious diner food. The Bloody Marys are spicy, the sandwiches delicious, and the cakes have never disappointed me. Being vegan, it is great to be able to go to a restaurant and be able to order 95% of the menu and have it come out of the kitchen hot and delicious. I love that there is outdoor seating in the summertime, and there is generally good music playing overhead. I have never left this place any less that uncomfortably full. Keeping in mind that it is a diner, I cannot think of a better place to run in for a casual meal of a few drinks, a sandwich, and some cheesecake and leave feeling happy and full.
