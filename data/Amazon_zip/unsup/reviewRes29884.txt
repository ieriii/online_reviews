I can't believe that I haven't been here before this summer! One of my vegetarian friends was always talking about it and I finally met him and his girlfriend here for dinner last month. AMAZING! I've now been back here twice more. Each time, it has been a fantastic experience. It's definitely nice to go to a restaurant and be able to eat everything on the menu. I have had the steak salad, gyros salad and country fried steak. I don't know what is in that seitan that they use, but I seriously dream about it. It's so delicious! The portions are really big as well. They also don't have any items with nuts on the menu (except the desserts), so I don't have to be concerned with that either. Makes for an easy dining experience for me. The restaurant itself is adorable and just like what one would expect a diner to be like. The service is fantastic as well. They also have a little parking lot next door so you don't have to worry about parking. You should definitely check out Chicago Diner, especially if you are dining with someone who is vegetarian or vegan! You really can't go wrong!
