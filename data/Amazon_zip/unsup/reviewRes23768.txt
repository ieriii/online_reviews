This is probably my favorite Greek Restaurant in Greek town and seeing as how I lived just outside Greek town for four years I'm well acquainted with the other options! I highly recommend the lamb or the chicken, and no trip to Greek Islands is complete without flaming Saganaki! I much prefer this restaurant to the Lombard branch, so if you thought the Lombard one was so-so then make sure you give the Chicago version a try before you right it off.
