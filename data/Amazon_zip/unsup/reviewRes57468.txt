We went to Geja's the first time yesterday and we LOVED IT! Just didn't think the price was fair for the full dinner, $51 per person for 4 little pieces of meat and 4 shrimps?? Next time we will just go with the cheese and chocolate fondue, it was enough to fill us up and had a fair price.When you decide to try on Geja's go with Oracio, he was our waiter and made sure we had an A-MA-ZING experience, for sure one of their best attendants, if not the best!!!
