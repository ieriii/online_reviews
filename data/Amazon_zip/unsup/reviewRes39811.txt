Pretty decent food. Definitely satisfies your craving if you're in the mood for some Korean. The service depends on how much money you spend. After coming here, I realized if your check is high, they'll be super friendly and constantly check up on you. If you don't order much, you're likely to be neglected. Also last time we were there, there was only three of us and they slapped the 20% gratuity on the bill. Wtf? We always tip 20% or more anyway but I was a little put off by that. On top of that, we couldn't find our waitress or any waitress for that matter to pay. When we did find them, they were all eating and gave us a dirty look like how dare we interrupt their meal time. Well, we just wanted to pay and go! Goddamn. They were super chatty and bubbly with other tables but wouldn't even give us the time of the day. Perhaps it was because we didn't order any alcohol that night?
