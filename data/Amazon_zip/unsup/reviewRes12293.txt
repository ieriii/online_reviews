this is the best thin/regular crust pizza in chicago. my friends and i favorites are: red pizza w/ basil, green peppers and fresh tomato white pizza w/ chicken, broccoli, sauteed mushrooms and to top it off, the home brews are amazing. worry'in ale is a fav but really i haven't had a bad glass (or pitcher) of anything. very very highly recommended to anyone visiting or living in chicago.
