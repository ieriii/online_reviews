I was lucky to be invited by a friend to attend a winemaker's dinner here. It was amazing and I cannot wait to go back. We had a variety of courses, paired with Provenance wines. The standout to me was the Wagyu rump roast which I've been calling "butter beef" because it was absolutely the most tender meat I've ever eaten. Other items that I enjoyed include the Pad Thai slaw, roasted corn and bacon succotash and the seasonal mushroom risotto.
