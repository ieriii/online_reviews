Even the frites have animal in them. :( The Publican is not vegan friendly, and it doesn't pretend to be either. Babe (the pig movie) came to mind as my eyes wandered from the animal-pen-like booths to the giant pig graphics hanging on the wall. Overall the decor and beige/brown color scheme is rather bland. I went on a prix fixe night, so the normally limited options were even moreso. Unfortunately for me the only thing I could eat was a tiny pickle that came with my friends' meal. I understand that it is a meat-focused gastropub, but I would think they'd have at least one option available for a vegan. Most of the "vegetable" dishes on the regular menu include meat. Ugh. Good thing I had eaten beforehand. On this particular night they were offering a Three Floyd's beer pairing, but I didn't partake. The Publican is not the place to go for a casual beer or two. It definitely seems like it's trying too hard to be fancy, but it really isn't good enough to justify the overpricing or stuffy atmosphere.
