i watched people move around to the sounds of people sitting. i tried a couple beers and they seemed adequate enough to do their job (like most of us, right? right). i engaged a dessert that was well made, built up, but fell slightly in it's actual performance. i may come back soon if the crowd dies down. also, much like the airport, this place features a family bathroom in which private parties can share intimate time in. a drinkingman's staple.
