We used to love this place and still love the atmosphere, but it's slipping. The appetizers are still our favorite dishes, especially the Camarones, but the entrees have slipped in flavor, meaning the Pernil tasted reheated and the Pollo was boring. Maybe it was just an off night because we went on on a Tuesday. But with our grande bill, it was a disappointment. We don't want to see this place go down the tubes,so kick it back up a notch! Oh, and the service was just okay.
