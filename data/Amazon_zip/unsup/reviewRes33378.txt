I FINALLY GOT TO COME HERE! We visited with our foodie friend who was looking for some good Italian food. I remembered this place and finally had a good excuse to come here. Without reservations. And without reservations. First of all, the ambiance. It's cramped. Really cramped. And loud. Oddly loud. And lit funny. It's very beautiful, though, but if they could turn the volume down on the conversation with some acoustic engineering it would've been a far better experience. Or stop service alcohol to loud people. Or just limit it to one table in the restaurant. Sorry. The food. Yes. The food was VERY good. Usually when I have Italian food, especially something like funghetto linguine with a cream sauce, I am expecting it to be heavy and almost pasty. Not the case here. It was so light and ... authentic. That's the only word i can think of, though it's not the right word. Light. Fresh. Flavorful. I love mushrooms and I could taste the mushrooms, that earthiness that I love about eating a raw 'shroom. That's what came out of the food. And that's what balanced this experience for me. I would definitely come back, but not on a weekend night. Definitely worth a return visit.
