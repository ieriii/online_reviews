ignore the snotty people who can't handle the aloof service and crowded atmosphere. just let your nose be your guide. when you walk in you can smell the fresh ingredients. i can vouch for the #89 as it is my favorite dish with grilled pork, vermicelli noodles, fresh mint and a delicious sour fish sauce. don't hesitate to go.
