Hot Dougs totally broke our hearts. Allow me to explain the tragic tale that IS our venture to Hot Dougs, Chicago. My boyfriend and I schlepped our asses here in a cab from Wrigley after the Angels/Cubbies game (Angels won, holla!). We came all the way from California for baseball, good times, good food, and the Hot Dougs dogs. We got there at 4:10PM on a Saturday only to have an employee shut the door on us and tell us they CLOSE AT 4. Ok, I know we should have checked that out beforehand but as Jesus would say, WTF?! 4PM on a Saturday? That is like a breakfast place closing at 8AM or Britney Spears wearing underwear: Just unheard of. My boyfriend asked the guy to let us in to get a dog but the life-ruiner employee was unsympathetic. I am sure the food is great but if you saw the sad puppy dog faces we sported you would hate Hot Dougs, too. Cab Fare: $39 round trip. Airfare/Hotel: $1200. Not getting the perfect Chicago Dog: Priceless.
