I didn't get the BBQ, as it was only lunch and I was eating with my manager at the nonprofit where I volunteer (which means no money for actual Korean barbecue). However, I was very pleased with my Dolsot Bibimbop. The clay pot was a good size, and the portions of meat and vegetables were generous compared to many places which have way too much rice and not enough meat. The panchan was OK, but by looking at the other tables, I suspect that you get a wider variety if you speak Korean (which I've found to be true at some other places).
