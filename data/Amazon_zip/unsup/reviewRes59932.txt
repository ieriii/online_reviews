Such a disappointment!! I ordered my baby's 1st birthday cake from here after all the reviews I saw and the cakes I saw in the store..I spoke to this guy Peter for 30mins explaining about the design and sent him pictures of other cake designs for reference. He gave me an estimate of $200 for it. I wanted a garden theme fondant cake with butterflies and flowers on it in hotpink, limegreen girly colors. But when I got the cake, I was so disappointed by the way it looked. It was pale and boring. There was no fondant. instead had icing and some lame design that probably I can design on my own. It was such a disappointment. But one good thing was that the cake tasted good and he charged me $120 instead. But I would have been OK if he had charged me even a little more but made the cake I wanted. I would not go back here. Dont trust them!!!
