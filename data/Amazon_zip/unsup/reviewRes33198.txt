I advise you to arrive during a time that isn't popular otherwise there is an hour wait. Other than that Yolk is alright with me! The portions are extremely hefty so don't be quick to order too much. I've tried breakfast and lunch and they are very consistent. The veggie skillets are tasty as well as the spinach and onion omelet. As for lunch, I admit I order the same thing every time and that is the BLT supreme with whole wheat toast pilled high with crisp bacon (MINUS THE BACON), avocado, tomatoes, swiss cheese, romaine lettuce, and mayonnaise and it's very addictive if you didn't gather that already. It's nice that Yolk gives you the option of selecting fruit as your side and also the strawberry-orange juice is a great treat!
