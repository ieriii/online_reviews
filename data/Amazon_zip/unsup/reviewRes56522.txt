All I can say is OMG! The margaritas are fresh and delicious, the appetizers unbelievable (ceviche trio) and the entrees...I enjoyed and savored every single bite. (carne asada and mole) Book your reservations far in advance, otherwise you might not get a chance to dine a the Frontera Grill. It is worth doing a little planning in advance!
