The only reason The Purple Pig doesn't get the complete set of stars is because we were told the wait would be 1.5 hours when we arrived so they jotted our name down and we went to get drinks elsewhere (it was beyond crowded), and returned an hour later. When we get there, the hostess tells us they called our name 15 minutes later. What? As if that wasn't annoying enough, they made us wait ANOTHER hour to finally be seated. By that time I was so hungry I could barely stand straight, *but* man, was it worth it. The restaurant is tapas style: all entrees are small and intended to be split between your dining buddies. We ordered Scallop Spiedini with Chickpea Aioli, Lardo Crostini, Milk Braised Pork Shoulder with Mashed Potatoes. All of them more delicious than the next. However, I can honestly say that the clear winner was the pork shoulder (& it seems to be everyone's favorite across the board) with the lardo very close behind. For dessert, we opted for the hazelnut ice cream (a little piece of heaven) and the Sicilian Iris (BEST THING EVER). Aside from the delicious food, the atmosphere was really nice. I can see it being a perfect spot for a date night or for celebrating a special occasion. The wait staff was knowledgeable and personable, and the location is really great. We were sitting outside and it was definitely romantic - paired with our "fun-sized" glasses of wine, I'd say we forgot about the annoyance of the wait pretty quickly.
