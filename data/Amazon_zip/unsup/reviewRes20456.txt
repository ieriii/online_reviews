NASTY!!!!! All these great reviews and our experience awful. First, our server was ready to take our drink order even before we sat down, then he was gone for fifteen minutes and came back without our drinks. We ordered our meal and got very uneven results. We had an order of mussels that were bad. Tasted bad and came back the next day to show us both just how bad they were.  I had fish and chips that came to our table cold to the touch and swimming in oil.  when I complained, the waited shrugged, took my plate and came back in five minutes with the same plate after microwaving it. Same everything. Disgusting..... My date had a burger that was very undercooked and had to be sent back. When we complined to the manager, he gave a standard "I'm sorry" but did nothing about it. More of a cold "So what" feel to it than anything. Was truly a horrible experience. Save your time and money and go someplace....anyplace....else.
