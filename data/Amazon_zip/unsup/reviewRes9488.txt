If I could give half stars place would get 3.5 stars. I almost gave it four, but just couldn't. There are too many other good restaurants in Chicago that deserve four stars over this one. The food is actually decent, but nothing too inventive here. I'm still wondering where the french influence is. My date and I both enjoyed our meal. The duck is very flavorful and not fatty at all. However, it was a little tough and really doesn't come with anything on the side. The other dishes were your basic Vietnamese dishes, but nothing to write home about. All in all, it's good food, but maybe not good enough for the price. Now to the atmosphere. This place gets FIVE STARS for atmosphere. It seemed like an older crowd. I don't know about anyone else, but I'm getting a bit sick of the trendy, loud, casual, warehouse-like atmosphere of a lot of the new upscale restaurants. This place is quiet, romantic, dark and not pretentious......a throwback to the classy, swanky restaurants of the past. I didn't think I was in Chicago anymore. Le Colonial, don't ever update your interior.
