CONS:Rooms are Tiny. (queen room) Walls were fairly thin as I could hear loud talking in the next room. PROS: Free Wifi is nice! although not fast- the hotel Is clean and Modern as well as in a decent location. Staff was good. Other thoughts: I feel like I kinda overpaid @165 per night. Would look elsewhere if you're close to 200 dollars. I would say it's on the low end of all the 4 star hotels.
