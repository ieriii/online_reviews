My favorite pizza in Chicago! A place that I take my Napoletano buddies to and they love! And they are the real food critics, let me tell you... This is a place that the owner is really passionate about and it shows. The quality of the food keeps me coming back year after year and is always my #1 choice when anybody asks me where I wanna eat.
