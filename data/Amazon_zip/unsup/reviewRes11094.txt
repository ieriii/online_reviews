I love Piece! My husband and I have driven past this place many times and we never stopped. We finally went with another couple and it was love. I love white sauce pizza (garlic, oil and mozzarella cheese) and can never find a place in the city that has it. When I looked at the menu and saw they offered that, I knew this place would definitely make our restaurant rotation. I just added spinach to mine and viola! Best pizza ever!! I got the small and I always bring home leftovers. My husband loves his red with bacon and pepperoni. We never share.  We came here last Saturday for the Bears first preseason game and got seated right away. There were only 5 of us and even though I tried making reservations, they only accept for parties of 10+. We got there around 5:30ish and it was fairly empty. We ordered two different large pizzas and pitchers of beer and sat enjoying ourselves watching the Bears play.  It's definitely a great place for a big group. I grabbed their menu and noticed that they don't deliver to where I live. I miss their delivery area by two blocks. Extend your delivery area Piece! I would order from you every week!
