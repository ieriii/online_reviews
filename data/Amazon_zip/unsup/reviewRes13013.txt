Eh, totally agree with Annie P.'s review. Taste of Cuba was just so-so and presented on this HUGE plate so the tiny little portions looked even smaller. I got one of the specials, chicken breast with asparagus and goat cheese, and it was really bland (and I'm into bland stuff normally). My human garbage disposal BF got the pork roast and hardly ate any of it, he hated it so much. Our server was very nice but too much time elapsed between visits. The check amount was definitely shocking for the amount and quality of the food. There are a thousand places I'd rather go for Latin food in the city, places that leave me happy and full and not too broke.
