I've been there twice and both were pretty times the food was less than stellar. 1. after moving, came in around 10pm saturday night. My bf and I were suuuuper tired so we opted for the fastest food options. We each got a piece of the ready made deep dish pizza and split a large garden salad. The pizza had a LOT of crust and not enough cheese or pepperoni (in my opinion, although I do like a heaping ton of cheese & meat on my pizzas). My bf's sausage pizza was a bit heartier. The garden salad was HUUUUUGE, a lot of veggies, but the butter dressing was weird...a bit too solid to be dressing. 2nd time: super hungover after my birthday party and stumbled across the street for some greasy food. I craved a juicy italian sausage sandwich after the one I had at Al's. But this one was tiny, dry and overall NOT HUNGOVER approved at all-only good part, the service was really quick. However, despite my 2 less than mediocre visits: I will still go back...because I'm persistent and lazy!
