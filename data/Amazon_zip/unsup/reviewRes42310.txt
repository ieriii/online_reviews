Gilt Bar is right to tell us that we should probably be eating there. Just being inside makes me feel a little bit classier. The decor reminds me of how i pretend my apartment will be if/when i ever grow up and have hemmingway over for a drink. It was fairly noisy, but otherwise ideal. To Start: ham and cheese fondue w/ toasted sourdough & fried farm egg. (meh) Followed by: the Paris mushroom & truffle pasta (O M G amazing) Main Course: salmon with the parmesan green beans and cornbread as a side. (Pleasantly surprised, I never really expect a salmon dish to WOW) The entire meal was delicious, as I expected it would be. The pasta was the highlight for me, i love ANYTHING with mushrooms and it was simply divine. Next time I aim to sit on the beautiful couches and drink red wine - followed by a drink downstairs at Curio. Overall, Gilt Bar lived up to the hype, an impressive feat.
