Albeit there really is no decor, unless the car you drive has leather seating, but this place still rocks. Drive-up is underrated in this country and really makes the dining experience fun. The food is your classic burgers, dogs, and fries, oh and milkshakes, that just taste great. Ask for plenty of napkins as it can get messy and be patient as it can get packed at times.
