Must be fair. The peking duck was excellent and so was the bbq pork appetizer. The other dishes like the fried rice, chow mein, fried spare ribs, and roast duck soup were all just okay. I think other places in chinatown are better for this. But this is a great place for bbq! Therefore, I must give a 3.
