great lunch during restaurant week! hush puppies - good and crispy chicken wings - the best! need more! beet salad - good pickled cucumber - the reason why i keep on coming back! brisket - yum!!! tender and juicy ribs - ok, slightly burnt but tender cornbread - too crumbly carrot cake - the best in the city! still the best!
