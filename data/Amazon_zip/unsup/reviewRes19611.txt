Overall, the food we had was quite good. Everything else about the restaurant SUCKED! Our appetizers took a long 45 minutes to get served and only about half of them made it to our table. Apparantly, another server grabbed our "apps" and gave them to another table. Finally, when our other apps did come out, the server said, "Here are your crab cakes, watch out, they're hot and shit!" I'm quoting him verbatim on that one. We asked for wine glass 5x before they brought them out. There was this drunk gal that was yelling, "Amurica!!!" throughout the course of our dinner, then she felt inclined to light up in the middle of the restaurant not abiding by the 15 ft law or whatever. Did the management do anything? NOPE! After we finished our apps, we anxiously waited for our sushi as well. In what seemed to be an hour after ordering it, our sushi arrived. Finally, when we complained to the manager, she pulled out her "time card" to argue about when we arrived, when we ordered, etc. During our discussions, she would giggle as if to say, "I've got these suckers by the balls!!!" Never at any point did she admit fault whatsoever nor did she try to fix anything! In the end she took off 20% from our bill which we felt was ridiculous! I could go on and on about Coast. In the end, talk about horrible restaurant management! I think management should attend McD's Hamburger University to learn a thing or two on service. I've never had such a horrible dining experience in my life and will NEVER goto COAST SUSHI again!
