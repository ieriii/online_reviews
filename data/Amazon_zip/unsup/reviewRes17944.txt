the drinks are great. the atmosphere inside is pleasant.. but was a 1.5 hour wait in line worth it..? nope! especially for parties of 2, the wait can be excruciating, since the doorman will take first the larger parties of 3-5 people (who are behind you in line!) to fill the booths inside.. the line & 'the rules' add up to an annoying, pretentious circus..
