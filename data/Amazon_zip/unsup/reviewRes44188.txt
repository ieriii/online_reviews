I recently wanted a specialty cake made for a special occasion. I have never had a large specialty cake made so I was a little nervous, but Alliance went above and beyond during every step in the process. .  When I first called the bakery to describe what I wanted and when I wanted it, they gave me several ideas and suggested several days/times to come in to meet with a cake decorator to design the cake.  When I went into the store to design the cake, I met with a great designer who put together a few ideas and then called in the owner who really took it to the next level. My original design would have had very little cake, so the owner came up with a new design that would not only feed my guests but also look great.  When I picked up the cake, it looked better than the original sketch. The cashier offered helpful tips to keep it fresh and cool as well as to bring it out to my car.  At the party, everyone was very surprised by the design and then thrilled with the taste of the cake. It was extremely moist and had the perfect amount of peanut butter filling for the chocolate cake.  All in all, a huge and delicious success!
