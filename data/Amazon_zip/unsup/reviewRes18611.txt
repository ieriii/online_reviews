NOM! On a whim we headed to Bad Apple the other night after hearing tons of things about it. We must've picked the perfect time because we were the only table sitting in back & there were about 4 people in the bar area. I'm reading other people complaining about service, food, whatever. We had none of those issues. Our burgers were perfectly cooked, fries weren't burned, undercooked, or drab. Their "poutine" was amazingly small & overpriced, but other than that I've got no complaints about any of our meal. Waitress was totally on point, knew the menu & was able to answer all our questions, our water & drinks were never empty. Maybe Bad Apple is a bit overpriced, but all in all I enjoyed our experience. After skimming through other reviews I'd be wary of going at popular times, but apparently it's a different place on off hours. Maybe they need a bigger staff so everyone could have an experience like we did?
