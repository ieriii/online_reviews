We were visiting Chicago and yelped this place. They dont take reservations so we tried to have dinner there on Friday night but it was 1 1/2 hour wait, so we decided to come back Sat for lunch. Yelp had good reviews, it was packed, we thought "must be great!" boy, were we wrong! First of all, it IS packed so seating was uncomfortable...service was good... Food was horrible! Lunch (no drinks only water...was $70!) and can I say again? Food was horrible! They serve a fried pigs ear salad... On fried kale. The whole thing comes with oil dripping at the bottom. We ordered bone marrow, disgusting. Their calamari? So strange the flavors... It was like the chefs don't know how to put flavors together. Would never go here again. Go to the Publican instead - it's more expensive but the food is like a food orgasm!
