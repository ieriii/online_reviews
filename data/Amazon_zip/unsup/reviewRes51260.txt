I came here with my parents, like some others, purely out of convenience. I live in the area and we were looking for something low key. The food was fine, the margaritas were fine. That's pretty much as far as I can go. We had nachos with ground beef as a starter, and it tasted fine, but looked awful. The ground beef was just shoveled over the top of it all like dog food. Ignore the whole "eat with your eyes" philosophy here. The burritos are the size of small dogs and taste pretty good. My dad liked his shrimp & my mom said her chiles were decent. However, Dad & I ordered flan for dessert and it was pretty bad. Super dense and incredibly sweet. Served with a weird maraschino cherry on top? Bizarre. Neither of us finished it. The service wasn't great either. The hostess asked us if we wanted to sit outside or inside and I guess we took too long to decide because she sat us inside before we could make up our minds. The whole thing was just really rushed until the very end when we tried to pay the check. Then we sat and waited about 10 minutes before our waitress made it back to the table. With all the amazing Mexican restaurants in the city, I probably won't go back to this one.
