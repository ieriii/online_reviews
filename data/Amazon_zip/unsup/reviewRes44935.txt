Deep dish pizza is of course a staple of any tourist visit to Chicago, but somehow the pizza at Giordano's did not leave a lasting impression on any of us. While it is undeniable that we love pizza, something about having to wait thirty to forty minutes for a pizza that is basically a lasagna with a crust seemed less than appealing to me. On our lunch visit, we ordered a twelve inch diameter medium special, which includes sausage and mushrooms with green peppers and onions, for our group of three and none of us could stomach the amount of cheese loaded into each bite of the pizza. Honestly, there is nothing about the pizza that a picture would have trouble communicating, but at the minimum, it was nice to have a waitress that understood our pain of eating the amount of cheese we did. And if you have leftovers, do not carry it around in your backpack all day while touring the city. It makes for a terrible time every moment your backpack is open and reminds you of how desperately in need of a gym you are. Also, at twenty-five dollars for a medium pizza, not quite sure if it would be worthy of revisiting. May just have to stick to thin crusted pizzas from now on.
