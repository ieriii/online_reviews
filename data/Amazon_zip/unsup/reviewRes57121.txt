Was very lucky to be invited to Revolution's soft opening!! The interior looks great! Warm and welcoming with a touch of modern melding well with the traditional. Re-use of beer barrels is creative and cool in the decorating. I tried many things on the menu and they were all great. Without exception. So I'm impressed. The deconstructed beef stew is super-delish, the brick oven pizzas were authentic and tasty, the mussels with mint were to die-for, and the fish and chips were very solid, although the side of slaw with honey and jalepeno stole the show on that dish. And, oh yeah! the beer. Okay, so I'm a girl and found the piney Iron Fist Ale to be a bit too much, but the Eugene Porter, the Cross of Gold and the Workingman's Ale were all really tasty. Rumors have it that carbonation has been a bit vexing due to the equipement automation, so I think they are running the machines more manually now and are working toward perfection. An overall very enjoyable experience with excellent food and drink and great service.Long live the Revolution!!
