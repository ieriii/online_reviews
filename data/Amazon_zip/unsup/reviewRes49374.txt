I love bin36. I really do. they have several 'areas' to sit...a great big bar, the cellar which is wine and cheese flights, and their sit-down area. I've had food off the sit-down area, delicious. The onion rings are so thin and light. The pepper-crusted tuna is awesome as well. This place is so fun w/people who love wine...the menu is built as tasting, to order flights. You can also pick individual wines from different areas and the waiter will pick out a bunch of cheeses to pair with you. Fabulous. I like to go here w/girlfriends, have great red wine and cheeses. It tends to be more dates then a single scene, but the bartenders are really friendly and have bought us champagne on more than one occasion. Side note...my family went here for easter brunch...$40 and unreal. One of the best brunches I've had...they had all the standard breakfast (including a great crabmeat eggs benedict) but also had lots of savory dishes. I ate my weight in cheeses, proscuitto, and many other dishes. We did flights of champagne, and my dad had the bloody mary flight which he loved. They do the same brunch for mother's day as well.
