I have it on good authority from a knowledgeable source that Milk & Honey has the best pickles of all time. I don't like pickles myself, but I know how important they are to some people so it's worth saying. Milk & Honey is pretty great for weekend brunch. The huevos rancheros are absolutely stellar, but so is more of their breakfast menu. I've enjoyed the lunches I've had there as well, but breakfast is really what they do best. I wish the menu was a bit larger, though. The breakfast menu is pretty short, and there isn't a lot of variety between the sandwiches on the lunch menu. Milk & Honey is perfect when it's slow and you can enjoy yourself, but it is a little bit of a headache when it's busy. The staff is great about keeping the restaurant running smoothly and is keeps you in the loop while you're waiting for a table (which is really nice - everyone hates standing there guessing about when they're going to be seated), but the place can get a little crowded. Still, even if you do see a line when you walk in, Milk & Honey is usually more than worth it.
