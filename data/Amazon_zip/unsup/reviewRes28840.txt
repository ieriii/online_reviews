This place has been thoroughly reviewed so I'll keep it somewhat brief. I have been here twice and enjoyed most items I've had. For appetizers, I highly recommend the mini sopes. They were shredded beef in tomatoes. I know his menu changes, so they may not always be there, but get them if they are. I also got the queso fundido which I thought was great. I don't recommend the tamales at all (mine were chorizo and bacon with some sauce on it). I also don't recommend the flautas. My entres were a steak dinner and duck tacos. I didn't not enjoy the tacos so much (except for the handmade tortillas...awesome). The steak was good though. Most sides are extra...like rice for example. For desert, I've had the flans and they are always good. I think that is a can't miss here and I highly recommend it. Overall, I took off a star for a couple reasons. One, the food is not amazing enough for the wait or price. I completely love Rick's show and books. I cook from them and trust them over any other book, but the restaurant is different. Go in knowing that he uses authentic flavors and ingredients, but twists the dishes a bit. I completely respect that he makes original dishes, but it may surprise those looking for the flavors they are used to.
