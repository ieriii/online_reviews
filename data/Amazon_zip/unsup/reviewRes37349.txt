Pretty sweet grocery store. Kinda small with all the people there. But people are courteous and will kindly move out of the way if asked. The pastry section is fabu! My mouth watered just looking at it. They have blackberries the size of your eyeball on some of the tarts :) If I'm in town and nearby I would definitely go back! Many interesting items to try too...
