After a big argue with the owner a year ago, i decided to come back last weekend and such a surprise that the rude owner was our waiter, seems like he is so desperate for money ... but the worst thing was that he kept disappearing into the kitchen, and wouldn't come and check on us, really sad and bad experience, never come back!!!
