Let me just say, I take my breakfast seriously. Not only is it the most important meal of the day, but I believe the best meal of the day. Yolk was fantastic! The decor is bright and trendy, and totally says "good morning, sunshine!". The menu is extensive, and I had a very difficult time choosing. I ended up ordering the Irish Benny, and I'm so glad I did! It's an "Irish" version of eggs benedict; it comes with tomato, corned beef hash, poached egg and hollandaise sauce. You get a side of potatoes and fresh fruit. The plate was huge! At first I thought I would never finish the whole thing, but bite after bite it slowly disappeared. Everything was delicious from the coffee to the homemade hollandaise. Honestly the only adjective you need to describe this place is yummy. You wont be sorry.
