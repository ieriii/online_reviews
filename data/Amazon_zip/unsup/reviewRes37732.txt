Solid mussels (where do they get the bread they serve with them - WOW) and great frites...if you show up right when they start serving food you'll likely have great service and have no problem getting seated right away. I love the cozy vibe in the back room - definitely a place to check out for a fun time. My major complaints about this place are (1) that they don't serve Duvel in the correct glass, and (2) they are quite strange with certain requests...it was empty and freezing so we asked to move one table over to be closer to the fire, and they said no! Not the hugest deal, but we all thought it was strange I will give them this - huge beer list and the servers really know the brews (and they are really good at making suggestions)
