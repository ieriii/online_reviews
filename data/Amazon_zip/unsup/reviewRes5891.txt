I have never really been to Taylor Street, I know...I am so sheltered. It is so cute! Anyway, usually when people suggest going out for Italian, I am like, meh...but that is because it is usually like boring and store bought pasta. Not Davanti! It was straight out of Italy awesome. The resturant itself is super cute. We actually sat on the rooftop, a great spot in the summer. It was a chilly night, but they had the heaters going so it was comfortable. The wine list was pretty extensive with affordable options, which is always nice. Now to the food. Love love loved the Focaccia di Recco! Definite must get if you go! The Vasi Burrata, Sea Salt, and EVOO was amazing as well! I thought I would love the Truffle Egg Toast the best, but it was just good. I mean it was good, but nothing out of this world. The other 2 apps showed this one up! For dinner I had the giant ravioli. After having this in Napa at Bottega, I had to try it here. First off, I love when Italian restaurants actually make their own pasta. Hello! That is why I am coming! This was delish! Super light and totally differerent, but delicious as well from the last one I had. My hubby got the risotto, which I was eyeing, and it was awesome. I would probably get it next time. Everything was great, the prices are so reasonable and it is a nice change from the typical places that serve the generic Italian dishes. They put a lot of thought into this place. I will definitely be back! Wish they took reservations...
