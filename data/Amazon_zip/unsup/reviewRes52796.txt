Fantastic ambiance! Good service! Fair portions! The food tasted better than other cuban joints I've visited in the city. It was nice to see vegetarian and gluten-free options in their menu as well as items that I've rarely seen elsewhere, such as stuffed yuca, guava/cheese empanadas and goat cheese empanadas. The place is BYOB, which I didnt know until I got there, was lucky to find wine a few blocks away. The place was packed and I assume based on the amount of reviews, I've seen here, that its pretty popular, so make sure to make reservations. For appetizers, we tried their croquetas, which were good, but not sure those were "homemade" as the server stated, also had their guava and cheese empanadas, which were delicious! As an entree, went simple, had their chicken with grilled onions, rice and black beans and yuca al mojo. It wasnt over the top, but again, it was better than what I've tried at other cuban places.. I would definitely come back!
