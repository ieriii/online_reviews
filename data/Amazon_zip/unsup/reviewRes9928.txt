After being asleep for an undetermined period of time, I finally found out that Piece does carry out. Piece Out: the only pizza joint you'll drive three miles/20 minutes for when you know the pizza will be only warm when you get home, but it's still good as fuck. Being perpetually single and romantically inept to every degree of the imagination, this allows for basically the perfect night in cuddling with yourself and watching the same 80's movies over and over again for the last 20 years.
