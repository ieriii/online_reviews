My family has been going to Sabatino's for years. It's such a family favorite that my wife chose to go to Sabatino's for her 50th birthday (we brought our two daughters, who were 8 and 11 at the time). We love this place -- the food is usually great, the service is usually great it's on a par with or better than much more expensive places that are located downtown. The night we went, the service was unbelievably bad. We could hardly believe it was the same place. Where to start? First of all, we were there for 2 hours and 45 minutes -- far too long for any dinner (yeah, that could be us, but we've never spent more than an hour-and-a-half in a restaurant). Two of the main courses were overcooked. The waiter and staff were very slow in clearing the table. I asked for a spicy Bloody Mary -- it wasn't spicy at all (not a crime, I know, but it would have been easy for them to take care of). A busboy dropped a couple of things and cursed in front of our children. Our first waiter was not especially friendly (they replaced him in mid-meai). I hate to say this, but I think it's true: I believe a table of 4 businessmen would have been treated better than we were -- much better. I've probably been to Sabatino's 15-20 times. Great place, but the restaurant blew it on a very big occasion for us. I wrote the owner about it a couple of days after the meal. He never wrote back. The meai cost $170.....I'd like to go back and give Sabatino's another chance....but after a dinner like that, I'm not in any rush. At the very least, if the busboys are going to curse in front of children, can't someone at least teach them a few Italian curses?
