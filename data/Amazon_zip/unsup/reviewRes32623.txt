This was my very first time. And as we ALL know that FIRST times aren't ALWAYS pleasant. Though they might be, or HAVE been for some of you. :-D Well, my FIRST time was amaaaazing. My first time to Demera that is. :-) My best friend Sam asked if I wanted to go and try Ethiopian food before we pranced off to boystown for drinks and I gladly agreed because I ALWAYS trust his choice of restaurants. :-) When we first got there, we were greeted, and seated by an extremely friendly Ethiopian (I know so because I asked where she was from) woman. She brought us menus and our waters, and we decided to start out by ordering the sambusas which are very similar to the Indian Samosas. As our main entree we decided to get a platter with both meat and veggie dishes since I don't eat meat (on the table anyway) ;-D We were both extremely pleased with the savoring and delicious cuisine the chef whipped up (for a lack of a better word) for us. My second time here was with my parents and they were very impressed with the food. (its hard to impress Desi parents with non Desi food) The prices here are very affordable as well. And ofcourse its close to the train so it makes all the more appealing. Though if you DO decide to drive, ample parking is available on the weekdays. :-) p.s Girls and Guys (lol) do not take your done up nails with either clear or white polish because the food coloring/spices leaves color (mostly yellow) Trust me! :-)
