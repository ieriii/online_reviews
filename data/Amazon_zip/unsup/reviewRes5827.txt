Cool place with really good food. Went on a Saturday night with wife and 2 kids - 6:15 pm arrival with plenty of seats available (place was completely filled up as we were leaving around 7:30 or so). The place oozes charm with brick lined walls stacked with wine bottles and dark wide plank hardwood floors and antique mirrored walls. Food was above average - not to die for, but very, very good. We had the Ricotta with Honeycomb - it was a big hit. Beet salad with Mascarpone and walnuts - really fresh and delicious. Escarole salad with apples and pecorina cheese - light and fresh with salty accent from the cheese. Kids tried it all and also had a simple cheese pizza which they loved. We had the mushroom, leek and truffle oil pizza - it was very good. The simple spicy boar salami might have been the highlight of the night. Overall, a really good place.
