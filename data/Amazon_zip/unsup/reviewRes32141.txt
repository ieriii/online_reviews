Stopped in here for a bite before heading out to a movie. I liked the layout of the space -- there's a small lounge and bar in the front, a largish dining room along one side, and a community table which separates the dining room from the sushi bar which also has plenty of seating. The lighting and decor is subtle and cozy, yet modern. Service was efficient and friendly and got us out in plenty of time.  Had yummy Bombay martinis to start. We ordered a few rolls -- the mushroom roll was earthy and a nice change of pace, topped with fried enokis for crunch. We had the spicy tako roll and the rainbow roll, both of which were very good.  If I find myself in the neighborhood again, I'd go back to try more of the menu and the drinks. Seems like a good place for a big group, a date, or to dine alone, given all the seating options.
