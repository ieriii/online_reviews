Went with two women- girlfriend and her friend from Colorado. They drank Allagash tripel (like a light barleywine) and Lost and Found Abbey Ale (hoppy) and I had a ginger beer. We started with chicharrones- light and popcorn-y seasoning- not Mexican. The smoked arctic char on bread with mascarpone, peas and cucumber reminded me of Door county in the summer. Country ribs had a lot of flavor, served with ramps and chunky tomato relish. The taste of 3 hams was hammy. Fennel gratin was more focused on burrata and parmesan. Fries at the end put me over edge.
