I frickin love this place. I went by it on a visit last May, and it just looked inviting. I asked about it and everyone seemed to have the same answer, "Oh. My. God. I'll take you to Piece. It's the best." While I was never taken there, I went with the boyfriend (who is a pizza freak) the 2nd weekend after moving to Chicago. We ordered broccoli and ricotta on our pizza and it was simply amazing. The olive oil used on the crust makes a big difference. If it could satisfy my guy's sophisticated pizza-buds, then I think it can satisfy anyone. Our server was great. The ambiance was fun, too. If you like beer, I recommend trying one of their home brews as well. We had to wait about 40 minutes for a table, but that's what you can expect on a Friday night around 7:30pm. That just allowed us time to walk down the street and explore more. Just Indulge was a place we scouted for dessert.
