I have been going here for at least 15 years. The food is authentic, consistent and excellent. There are only 2 negatives. Their service is what you'd expect from Korean establishments, not so great. They treat Korean adults (40+) differently than young adults, particularly favored towards men. When I go w/ my uncle and his family, we get many free refills on the banchan. When I go there with my friends, the free refills disappear and out comes a $1 charge per dish. Totally unfair, but true. 2nd negative is that the ventilation inside is very poor. I always leave w/ my clothes, skin and hair reaking of korean bbq. So, be prepared to be smelly afterwards.
