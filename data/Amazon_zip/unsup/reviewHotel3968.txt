Can anyone say, "The Shinning"!!!! This hotel is creepy and old. Usually, I love kept up old architecht but this had our toilet over flow two days out of two days we stayed there and they really didn't care! All the presidents except GWB and Obama have stayed at this hotel. That is an interesting fact and tells you just how old the place is. Cool high ceilings and an awesome lobby and bar area except for the employee's. The front desk would not help me when concierge was not around for directions and concierge was doubled as a parking lot attendant/bell hop who had to be called in to work concierge when he was busy working the other stations. The bartender is a grump and will NOT help anyone unless you literally wave your hands and yell for him. Then if it is 10min before closing (10pm on a weekend) he won't serve you because he is too busy closing. Just to even walk through the bar he will not greet you or smile. No WI-FI. The only good thing about the place is that it's location is perfect for the price.
