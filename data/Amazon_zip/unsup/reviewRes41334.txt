How should steak be cooked? That's the biggest question I've never gotten an answer to. From my experience,fancy places serve it straight up. Crappier places throw some sauce on it, Ruth's Chris cooks it with a load of melted butter. I've been here twice. The first time a couple years ago (and the memory is kind of faded) but I recently went during restaurant week where they had an awesome $30 dollar deal that included an appetizer (gumbo or salad both of which were really good), steak (8-oz filet or 12-oz ribeye), side and dessert. I was extremely satisfied after eating here but more glad about saving more than $40 (which is what I would have had to spend if I ordered everything a la carte on a regular business day). The steak is decently cooked and I enjoyed it in the butter. The sides however were a bit disappointing. As much as I like regular potato sides, I think I've become spoiled after eating at fancier joints that serve up classier and more exotic sides. As much as I enjoyed my visit, I definitely feel there are a lot of better places.
