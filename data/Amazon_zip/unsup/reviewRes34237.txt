oh my goodness. i wish i could give this place more stars. with a gluten allergy, i never get to eat pasta anymore unless i make it myself (and since i conveniently hate cooking, that never happens). i was so excited to get an enormous bowl of delicious pasta with fresh vegetables placed in front of me! the vegetables tasted like they'd literally been picked from some garden they had growing out back, rinsed, cooked and thrown into my food. ohhh so good. the wine was delish, service was excellent, lovely ambiance - just can't complain. everyone must go!
