I ran here from Hyde Park - 14 miles - in early April, in the rain, for Doug's encased meats. Unfortunately, the line-out-the-door's pace of movement is glacial and so was my core body temperature by the time - 45 minutes later - that I even managed to make it under the paltry awning. It was more than an hour before I got hot food - 3 dogs and duck fries - in my belly. By then, my lips were blue, I was literally shivering, and I was an hour and a half away from home via bus-El-bus. But, to be fair, if my quest for Hot Dougs almost killed me, the dougs themselves veritably gave me new life.
