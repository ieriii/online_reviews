I didn't really see the big deal about Indie Cafe. I had a pleasant lunch there on Friday, but it wasn't the amazing experience that I had been led to expect by the reviews here on Yelp. Instead, I had some solid Thai curry in a swankily decorated restaurant. I did appreciate the value of the $7 lunch special, though! I didn't find anything wrong here, just nothing too memorable. If I lived in the neighborhood, I'd probably come back due to the convenience factor, but for non-local residents, it doesn't seem worth a trip out of the way.
