Tony's Dry Chili chicken is one of my all-time favorite dishes - get a double order and take the rest home! Baby bok choi (baicai?) is a nice compliment. I always get the same thing when I come here, and the people I'm with sometimes bitch about that, and I say, hey, it's their signature dish, their keynote, what they do best!
