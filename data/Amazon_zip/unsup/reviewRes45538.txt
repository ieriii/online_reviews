I love Wilde. I don't come her often because the price point is a weeeeee bit much for me for chronic trips, but the food is amazing and the atmosphere is absolutely killer -- especially if you realize what was there BEFORE Wilde (a hardware store!). Wilde is usually a brunch standby for my friends and I. I absolutely adore Wilde's Mac & Cheese -- delicious. It's a fabulous addition to the Broadway strip between Wellington and Belmont. On a side note: service CAN be painfully slow at times, depending on how busy it is. Que sera sera. It hasn't gotten to the point where I'd knock Wilde down just yet.
