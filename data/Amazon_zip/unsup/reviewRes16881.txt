Alice in Wonderland. That's what it feels like when you walk through the velvet curtains and see a beautiful lay out of high-backed chairs. I was expecting the mad hatter to be our waiter... The drinks are a bit pricey, but absolutely incredible! I had the honeydew and it was spot on. it was fruity, full of a citrus flavor when it hit my lips, with a nice honey sweetness going down. The scene was intimate and perfect for catching up or for a date. Not ideal for eating... I recommend for a chill evening out. The only downfall I experienced with this place is their arrogance. They think their poo don't stink.... and it really doesn't but when you walk in and you feel like you're not good enough for their establishment, it's kind of an instant turn off. that is the only reason why I gave them 4 stars instead of 5. otherwise A+
