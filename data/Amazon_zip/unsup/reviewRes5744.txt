Perfect for in-town visitors, I've been to Wildfire's downtown location & Schaumburg. Both are usually packed but allow you to reserve ahead with Open Table, highly recommend doing this. I've had the filet crusted in bacon & horseradish and it is worth the calorie splurge. Also make sure to start with a cobb salad (they're notorious for this), a small is plenty enough for a table of 5-6 to share. But make sure you save room for dessert! They have some huge and decadent items that they'll bring out on a massive try to show you after you eat, there is no way of avoiding it ;)
