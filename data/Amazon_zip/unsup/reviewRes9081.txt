Hands down - the BEST experience I've had in my entire life! What a way to celebrate a birthday!  I told my son I wanted to try something new, and sure enough, he came up with this. I was dubious of the fusion, though determined to expand my palate. From the hand painted tiles that lead you into the eatery, to the tin ceiling tiles, to the tunics worn by staff, it's clear no detail was overlooked.  Our waiter was as perfect -- just out of site, but attentive all at once! At one point, I bumped my glass and used my napkin to clean it up -- *POOF* another napkin appeared! He made suggestions based on our likes -- I'm not a fan of spicy, He was able to suggest the perfect dish for me to enjoy! We finished our meal and were chatting - going over the desert menu, my son gave me my birthday card. Our server took our order and when it came, my tart had a candle in it. I was astonished. Our server confessed he took the liberty as he had taken note of my birthday card laying on the table!!  I would suggest Le Colonial to *anyone* who wants a stellar dining experience. From our server, to each and every person who tended our table, we were not rushed - & truly felt catered to, and I can truly say I have not had a better dining experience ** in my lifetime.** BEST . BIRTHDAY . EVER!! Thank you Le Colonial! you have gained a rabid fan!
