Danny was a great server- truly epitomized service with a smile. We tipped him well because he just put you in a good mood! What a great way to start the morning! The hostess left something to be desired but it's not like my expectations for Yolk rested on the performance of the hostess. We went to Yolk around 11AM and it was packed! We were seated within 5 minutes, but the food took a good 20 minutes to arrive (a little slow for my taste). If it weren't for us being on leisurely vacation, we would've been fairly annoyed with the wait. As for the food, everything was eggcellent! We had eggs benedict (they were decent but not drool-worthy) and the Mediterranean frittata (tasty and huge portions). I do have to say that my order, the peach cobbler crepe was the best of the three dishes. The order comes with 3 gigantic crepes. They might ask you if you want caramel or whipped cream on the side but I think the crepes taste great without it. It comes with sugar on top anyway. The crepes literally taste like fluffy thin eggy pancakes. I am not a huge fan of pancakes but these were addictive. And they gave a lot of peaches too. I got a side order of sausage just to add some protein into my meal. It was $2.99 and came with 3 really big sausage links - more than I cared for. I'd skip the sausage unless you just have to have it. If you're looking for a variety of great breakfast food, this is the place to be! What I love the most is that substituting for egg whites is FREE of charge! Most places are pretentious about it and charge you an extra dollar for it, but not here! There are so many other things I want to try next time - their french toast or waffles or omelettes or skillets. Everything looks amazing and they have such a big variety of food too - western flavors, Mexican flavors, American flavors, southern, etc. I will have to definitely come back to get my next Yolk fix!
