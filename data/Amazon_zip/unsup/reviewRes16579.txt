I visited the Violet Hour this past weekend at the suggestion of a friend living in Chicago. I wasn't disappointed. Mysteriously placed with a an unmarked door The Violet Hour is an experience. We were greeted by the well dressed, well built, witty doorman who joked with us while checking our IDs before ushering us into the main lounge.  The Violet Hour is indeed a dusky blue surrounded by dim lights. I was surprised by how large the place was once actually inside.  The hostess and the servers were courteous and attentive and our ultra-high backed booth was both cool and private. Our drinks were delicious- and yes a bit overpriced- but the atmosphere of The Violet Hour made up for that to me. Definitely take the time and visit The Violet Hour.... if you can find the entrance.... which is half the fun.
