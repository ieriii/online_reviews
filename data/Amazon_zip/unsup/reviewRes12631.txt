So much meat! Honestly an overwhelming amount of delicious food. My friend and I drunkenly wandered here and we filled our plates from the salad bar. The salad bar is more like a top of the line buffet, from amazing mashed potatoes to prosciutto it was all rich and amazing and a meal on its own. Then there is the meat, every kind of meat you can think of is floating by you on what looks like a sword held by gauchos supporting them on little plates. You get a little placard to indicate if you want more meat. Green is yes, red is no. They come by and offer it to you until you flip over the sign. I'm telling you it is so hard to flip that sign over, but then your table is full! Anyone who dislikes this place I find it hard to believe. It doesn't even stop there! There are aerial silk performers behind a sunk in section of the wall who perform while you dine. My friend insists that it be described as ' ridiculous' but in the best ways possible. Its best to have a place to sleep somewhere close by. This was definitely a highlight of my trip.
