Excellent food, horrible service. The DMV has better service than they do. Typically, when you go into a restaurant, you're asked if you want drinks and if you decline, some sort of beverage is brought out to you, typically being water. My entire lunch here went without anything to drink besides the oolong tea they serve every table, which is piping hot. I had ordered a Coke only to discover they were out and so I changed the order to a Sprite. I'm guessing they were out of this as 10 minutes later, two of the waiters walked in with 10 cases of an assortment of Coke products. Apparently, they forgot I ordered drinks. Giving them a few minutes, I flagged down a waiter. Asking him for a soda yielded the response, "Please ask your waiter for it." To which the only thing I can think of is, "YOU ARE THE WAITER!" Beverage issue aside, when you come in for lunch, you SHOULD get the Lunch Menu, but they give you the dinner menu. You have to specifically ask for a lunch menu or else your bill will be closer to $40 instead of $20. And to get this, I had to wait another 10-15 minutes because I'm guessing the waiter did not understand which menu I was referring to or even what a a menu is. If you want to go here, great, but don't go expecting good service. Best solution is to do take out from here. It'd be quick/easy without the fuss of dealing with people who cannot understand simple requests from you.
