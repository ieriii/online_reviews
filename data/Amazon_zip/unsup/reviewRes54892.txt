Hopleaf, where people go to feel sophisticated by drinking overpriced fancy beers and act like they are above the light beer drinkers. I mean come on this bar does have good food, a solid layout and such but the clientele can be quite pompous about the beer. I was given a suggested beer and it tasted like raw hamburger. Hopleaf in one word.......OVERRATED.
