We walked here from the zoo on a hot Friday for lunch. Our server, Sean, treated us very well even though we split a sandwich and our check was small during a crowded time . . . not to worry, we gave him a good tip. The restaurant had a pub feel to it and was quite busy with lots of families with small children. Noisy in a good way for me although my wife didn't agree. We both were happy with the food - the soup from the salad bar surprised us at its quality and the swiss cheese and mushroom turkey burger was delish, refills before you ask on sodas. They split the burger for us without complaint and gave us ample french fries along with pickles. The general manager was busing tables and was very pleasant when we chatted him up. Too be sure, this was not a high-end, white-tablecloth deal, but it's a solid choice if you're at Lincoln Park. We will definitely put it on our list of favorites. Tab was $26 including an $8 tip.
