Amazing deep dish, like no other in Chicago. The sauce is thick but not chunky, with a robust flavor. The sausage is great, crumbled, not a sheet like at Lou's, which can be overwhelming. Great spices too. And the trademark caramelized crust was icing on the cake, it was delicious, I wish that the whole crust had more of it. Absolutely awesome.
