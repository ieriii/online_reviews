For the love of God, au jus is NOT a good substitute for syrup. EVER. (see also: Garlic french toast in my O'Donovan's review) Yes, admittedly this was my own blunder. My little brother had a steak sandwich, and put his au jus sauce next to me...right before I decided to decorate the carmel/custard french toast with it. DUH. Not cool, Colleen. Regardless, some of the plate was spared, and we got to indulge in a very luscious plate of french toast...one of my fav meals, EVA. Everyone at the table was in agreement: GOOD STUFF. Lavazza coffee...one of my favorites. Hot, smooth, quick to refill. Amp me up, Meli...I'm ready. I can see why this place is so packed on the weekends, there was a wait on Friday at lunch...and it's not even THAT small. It's just, yeah...pretty awesome. I'm not gonna lie, I would've eaten the french toast with steak sauce on it...but I was fearful of judgment from my dining companions. Next time, I'll be more careful. :P
