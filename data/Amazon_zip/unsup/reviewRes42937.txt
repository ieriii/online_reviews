Upon entering Gilt Bar I was hoping for an exceptional experience but was met with a slightly-better-than-ok one. The host was not very helpful with letting us know where we should sit or if the tables that were located were only for food-ordering patrons. We ended up going downstairs to check out the lounge. We placed our name on the list as there was a wait to be seated (our party was 5 in number). We went back upstairs to have drinks at the bar which were very nice. Once we were called (via cell) to let us know our seats were open in the lounge, the experience got better. The extensive drinks list as well as the mixology drinks there were very nice, however it was difficult to see the menu because the lighting was very dark in the lounge. But the drinks were amazing! I had started with a whiskey sour upstairs and finished with a Pimm's mixed drink. All said, I would go here again and I would try the food as the menu looks interesting.
