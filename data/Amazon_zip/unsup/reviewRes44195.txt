This place is awesome! Had a 3D cake made for my birthday. Not only was the design beautiful but the carrot cake that it was made of tasted so good, it was nice and moist :). I put the picture in the photos on here, it's of a film reel. It costs a little bit but it was well worth it. It helped make my birthday one to remember.
