The Purple Pig -a great name for a great restaurant in Chicago. Like the title says, expect a good selection of wine and fine foods. I love pork and do they have a wonderful selection. I have only been once to the restaurant (and arrived 5 minutes before the placed exploded. The menu is simple and full of creative options. Everything we sampled was crisp, fresh and well-prepared. The only complaint would be with the aggressive use of asiago in the artichoke dish. I like my asiago cheese, don't get me wrong, but over use can spoil a dish.  My favorite dish of the night was the Jamon Serrano with mushrooms and fried egg over an amazing grilled bread. Note, not all menu items were available that night, so this was our favorite given our options. Overall, the experience was fun, lasting and I would gladly go back.
