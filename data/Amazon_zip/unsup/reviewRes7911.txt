I really, really wanted to love Spacca. I'm pretty close, so I think some day it will happen. I hold the bar pretty high for pizza because not much can top my precious Sono Wood Fired, but I gave it a shot based on a recommendation. Spacca is right off of the Montrose Brown Line so I was excited to have easy access to traveling north. I don't make it up that way often! My first impression of Spacca was one of awe. The place was super packed on a Saturday night and I was glad I had made a reservation a few days in advance. My second impression was that it's kind of more of a family place than a "single ladies" place. Every light seems to be on at its full wattage while groups of families crowd around pizzas and talk animatedly to one another. My friend and I each got a glass of wine from their simple but decent wine menu and then ordered the Caprese salad and the prosciutto pizza. The salad came out at lightning speed and wasn't really a great portion for sharing. That was our mistake for not asking the server. Fortunately I had chosen a small friend to come with me, so I got plenty! The pizza came out pretty quickly too, and possibly a little too soon. I don't think it was cooked all the way and considering that it's thin crust that seems difficult to do. I wasn't a fan of the prosciutto either, which seemed pretty chewy and more "hammy" than it should be. The arugula wasn't very flavorful either. Despite all of this, don't think that stopped me from eating half of the pizza. All in all it was still better than the majority, but it hasn't won me over yet.
