First time trying Chicago style pizza! When you walk into this place you look like you are stepping into the hood. Lots of graffiti on the walls and very colorful. Reminded me of wahoos in California! We ended up ordering the spaghetti and a medium gino's special for 3 girls. The spaghetti was really scrumptious and flavorful. We all really liked the pasta!! The wait for the pasta didn't take too long and it came with 2 slices if crispy garlic bread as well. As for the pizza it took forever to come out. I think we waited about 45-55 minutes before it came. By that time we were all kinda full so we only had about 1 piece each. A medium has 6 slices and we wished we had ordered the small. It was my first time having Chicago style pizza and it was very thick and soupy. I really liked the crispy buttery crust. As for the cheese, I did not expect it to be that cheesy. In our opinion they put wayyyyy too much cheese and not enough sauce! They were also pretty generous with the pepperoni. Our waiter hooked us up with a grip load of jalapenos too so it went well with the pizza. :) Our meal was pretty cheap and they have very good lunch specials. Prices are reasonable for good portion size.
