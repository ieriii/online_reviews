I brought a huge group here. The wait staff is direct and to the point, they don't mess around, one of my friends compared them to "the soup nazi" on Seinfeld, which is pretty accurate. You have to take your shoes off to sit down, and I wore a dress, not suggested because you are sitting in a hole!  They don't give you that "American customer service smile" Its straight up what do you want and we will give it to you. Cooking your own food at a restaurant was a unique experience, not as relaxing. My boyfriend loves Korean bbq and it was fun to try the 20 million side dishes, I did not try the tiny fish because I am not a sardine fan. Kimchi was awesome and the meat turned out well.  The birthday party was a success and it makes conversation fun because it is a very active dinner. I wouldn't go out of my way to go back. I would rather try other Korean bbq places.
