The first time I ate here, it was below twenty degrees outside. I'd been walking for what felt like forever in the snow and there was a line around the block. I got up to the counter where the owner, Doug himself, was taking the orders. He was friendly and charming. This day, I had my first ever Chicago-style hot dog, and an order of duck fat fries. And I vowed that it was worth the wait. I've been back a few times since then. The wait times vary, but I'm never disappointed. I haven't had many of the crazy sausages, but that's OK because I'm happy with the good ole Chicago-style dog.
