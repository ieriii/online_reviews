Stayed here for 2 nights in April 2012. The rooms are clean, but small, all of the employees go out of their way to help, but the hotel itself leaves alot to be desired, at 129.00 per night, I expect the A/C to work, the room was 80 degrees all nite long, and didnt cool off till about 5 am, even with the window open. The pop machines didnt work on 12 of the floors. We booked a room for 4 and the room had only 3 towels, the pool was closed more than it was open, and if the pool is closed the smoking area is closed as well, which doesnt make sense to anyone with an IQ over 10, so people only smoke when the pools are open? This was a 50.00 a night hotel at best, matter of fact, most 50 dollar a night hotels have A/C that works.
