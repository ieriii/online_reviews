LOVE love LOVE this place. They mix my 2 favorite things... good beer and good pizza!Try the white pizza with goat cheese. and pretty much ANY of the beers they have on tap. (both their own brews or any of the ones hey have guest tapped) My boyfriend and I are total beer snobs so I am all about any place with a good tap list. Do yourself a favor and come here! perfect for both big groups of friends and dates!
