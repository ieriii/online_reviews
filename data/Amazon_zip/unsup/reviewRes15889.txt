"Hey, H. I've been walking back and forth a few blocks now and I still can't seem to find the place. Is the address right?" "Yah, there's no sign. You have to look for the yellow light." "Yellow light? Um... ok, I'm not sure what you're talking about, but I'm sure I'll... Ooooh! That's the yellow light! Bingo!" There's no sign. The door has no frame and blends in with the rest of the building. The yellow light lights up exactly at 6pm on Friday evenings. The various shades of blue, white accents, mutant sized chairs, and chandeliers provide a relaxed atmosphere. This place is perfect place to start or end a girls' night out or a date.
