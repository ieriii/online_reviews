really want to give it a 2.5found this place on yelp. had such a good rating + a monday deal so i had to try it out.4 of us went together, and they let us do 2 separate monday deals.there weren't too many appetizer or salads to choose from so we ended up getting the same ones, but we did get to try out 6 different entrees and 2 desserts.appetizers- avocado crostini: less flavorful guac on toast. meh.- fried calamari: decent (but can you really mess it up?)soup & salads- i think it was butternut squash. unpalatable :(- insalata stella: a nice salad. dressing was yummy. entrees- spaghetti & veal meatballs: overcooked and mushy spaghetti, and the meatballs lacked oomph. - mushroom risotto: again, overcooked. porridge-like.- pumpkin ravioli: deserved the hype. was delicious.- seafood linguine with zucchini strips: unmemorable- some whitefish with potatos: again, unmemorable- there wasn't anything alfredo on the monday menu so we asked if we could get any pasta with alfredo sauce. they totally obliged and gave us penne alfredo. totally simple, but the alfredo sauce was light & creamy & pretty good.dessert- hazelnut panna cotta: yummy- bread pudding: mushy, overly imbibed. kinda gross.really wanted to like this place but was very disappointed in most of the dishes. flavors were weak and pasta & risotto were overcooked. unpardonable for an italian restaurant.our waiter was super sweet, and service was awesome. but the food was disappointing.given that there are so many other options for italian, none of us will be back despite the deals & coupons.
