I usually end up going here for brunch if I'm in the area on Sundays. We're lucky and get out of some of the wait time by having one of our friends who lives nearby go down and get a buzzer as we're on the way. (Isn't that so nice of him?) Otherwise the wait on weekend mornings can seem eternal when you're starved. I've ordered a lot and tasted what my friends have ordered in the many, many visits. I don't think we've ever had anything we didn't like. Great coffee, and a huge selection of breakfast items. It's always tasted fresh and delicious. Plus I'm a sucker for the variety of cheeses I can have on my eggs. The only downsides have been that sometimes the service can get slow when it's very busy. And the last time we were there, they charged us for more jam. Not very expensive, but considering we were a larger group, you'd think they could've brought us two sets to begin with. Still, the food is great and I'll return next time I'm in the area.
