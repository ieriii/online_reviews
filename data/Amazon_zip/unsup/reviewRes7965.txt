SO GOOD! I am a drooling carnivore so this brazilian steakhouse was just up my ally. The bread that they serve in the beginning is amazing: soft, yeasty, fluffy, buttery....mmm.... The service is very good, considering the amount of people in the restaurant. The little green and red cards (I want more! Not right now, please) insure that a server with a rack of meat will sidle up to me and carve me any piece of meat that I want. The salad bar was good. Sort of walked right past it as this was my first time and was more focused on the plethora of meat. Expensive, but worth it. I recommend going for lunch rather than dinner - same food, but wayyyy more expensive at night.
