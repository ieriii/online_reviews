Before I get started, everyone should vist Superdawg at least once. This is a unique place and a one of a kind fast food restaurant. It is a drive in, no not an old fashion movie drive in, a food drive in with car hops and a completely retro feel. This place has been featured on countless TV shows, magazine articles and newspapers. Again, you must visit this place at least once and decide for yourself. That being said, the food is ok at worst and good at best. They don't use Vienna hot dogs and Vienna dogs are my favorite. However, the dogs are good. They are plump,served on a poppy seed bun and laying in a bed of crinkle cut fries. The burgers on the other hand are just ok and are not that good. They also have jumbo shrimp, which are good, served in a bed of fries on top of a hamburger bun with a pickle. The shrimp are breaded, large, deep fried and may be the best thing here. A close runner up are the fries, which are crinkle cut and come with the dogs/burgers/shrimp. The drinks cost extra-fountain pop or bottled water. I have not had desert here but they do have icecream. As for the price, Super Dog is expenisive and has an ATM inside a small eating area. Keep in mind this place is almost always busy and has a line most of the time. The service is good, fast and polite without any small talk. Now keep in mind Super Dog is not my favorite fast food place but I would highly recommend trying it for yourself.
