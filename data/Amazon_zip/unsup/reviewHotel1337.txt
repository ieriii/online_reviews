The service wasn't really up to the Ritz Carlton standard in my opinion. Could have been that I didn't stay there long enough... I don't know. It is in a great location right in water tower center. The hotel is in desperate need of being updated. It is like 1980 in the lobby and conference center. My room was updated and a lake view room which I liked but it was somewhat smaller than my room at the Four Seasons in Chicago. Overall I liked the Four Seasons in Chicago a lot better and would stay there over the Ritz Carlton. I know they are owned by the same company but the Four Seasons is totally updated and I liked it a lot better.
