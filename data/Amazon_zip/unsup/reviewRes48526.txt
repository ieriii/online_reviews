Good food! We went on a Sunday night and had their Sunday dinner special.  We started with a ham platter, and also got the prix fixe menu. Menu was delicious - an excellent soup, fish, meat & dessert. Only complaint would have been that the prix fixe menu that night did not have pork... so we made sure to order the appetizer dish. Food was excellent; we savored every moment of it. Very well thought out and put together.  Excellent beers too! Atmosphere: rustic chic. It was a little slow on Sunday, so we got seated in one of the "stables." When I was sitting, I could just barely see over the top of the booth to look around at the rest of the restaurant. It felt a bit isolating, but I can equally see this being cozy & intimate when the restaurant is bustling.
