People tend to rave about Longman & Eagle so I was excited to check it out. Perhaps sitting outside when it was a little too chilly for me set the tone for the night - irritated and uncomfortable. But that was my fault. What is not my fault was the food selection that we ordered: Bone Marrow - it was ok, nothing terrible but nothing great. Quail - seemingly overly fried chicken, with barely any meat. Soft shell crab - just not that melt-in-your mouth sensation that you're looking for. I didn't HATE Longman & Eagle, I just wasn't blown away by it, nor did it give me the incentive to want to come back. Had I sat inside and ordered differently perhaps my tone here would be a bit more positive...but on the flip-side, should I even have to worry about ordering wrong at a restaurant with such rave reviews?
