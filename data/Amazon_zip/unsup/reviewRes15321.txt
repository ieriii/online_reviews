This place far exceeded expectations. Their home brews are all very good and have both great taste and aroma. Overall, the service was great as well. The hostess informed us that it would be around an hour wait so the group I was with hung out at the bar until we got our table. The bartenders are all very well educated in what they are serving. The wait staff was wonderful. Our server made wonderful suggestions. At the end of the meal, the hostess came over and informed us that she was buying us desert because of how long we waited. Totally unnecessary but it was well received. The staff there acted like they actually careed about you. I highly recommend this restaurant. The overall enviroment will make for a great evening.
