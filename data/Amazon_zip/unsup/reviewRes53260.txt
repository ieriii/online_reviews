Went today for brunch with my mom and roommate. Brunch menu, in my opinion wasn't spectacular, but once again, the food was tasty. I got the spinach artichoke omelette, my mom got the beet salad, and my roommate got the black bean cakes. The dressing for the beet salad was a bit on the sweet side for my taste, but the goat cheese portions were awesome. My omelette was frickin' delicious, but probably a heart attack wrapped in eggs. The black bean cakes were my least favorite. They weren't bad-tasting, but they were not what I was expecting; they were more like pancakes with black beans through them. Service was perfect once again, the wait staff seem to have it really together.
