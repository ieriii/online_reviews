I'm a pretty tough critic when it comes to pizza (one of my favorite foods of all time) and it's been so hard for me to find another solid pizza spot. I was introduced to Spacca Napoli a few years ago and have since been back 3 times. There are a few reasons I like this place, and will trek up to Montrose to chow. First off, the ingredients and toppings on all of their pizza's are SUPER fresh and tasty. The crust is crispy and very light. I suppose if you're a fan of NY style pizza, this is the closest thing in Chicago to it, (but way better in my opinion). If you're out to dinner with just one person, I would suggest trying 2 different pizzas because they aren't huge by any means. The pizza went down amazing with their Peach Iced Tea which by the way was very refreshing. Our server was very friendly and helpful not to mention passionate about what he was explaining to us about the menu. We tried both of the appetizers they had on verbal special. The first one was kind of like mini fried sandwiches with cheese and marinara sauce (full of crunchy goodness). The next one was an arugula salad with prosciutto, the bread we were provided to put everything on was kind of dry and boring but overall very good. For dessert I had the Banana Gelato which was amazing and my friend had the Tartufo. YUM. I will be back many times for sure as this place is worth the drive!
