Everything on this menu is dynamite. This was my first time here. I was seated quickly, served quickly, and had a knowledgable server who recommended some killer wine with our dinner. Fresh seafood, unique marinara's and white sauces; the best italian I have had without doubt.Check this place out. There is something on the menu for everyone!
