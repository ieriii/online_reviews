I was really blown away with the quality of everything at this place. Te sevice, wine and food were incomporable. Definitely the best Churrascaria I have ever been to, must be the best in the world! BTW, just been to a Fogo in Botofogo in Rio, and it lived up to my 5 star experience. The view over the lake is stunning.
