This place is so yummy!!! I would recoomend this place to anyone willing to try out Ethiopian food or anyone interested. The lunch menu is reasonable and if you share it, it's totally worth it so you can try a little of everything. They don't use silverware and they use bread to pick up the food its a sponge bread...I really wish i could go here again i really want to try this again very very soon!!!
