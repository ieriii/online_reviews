So I came here (okay my mom is obsessed with Rick Bayless and made me come) and was delighted at the flavors of the restaurant. We were in Chicago basically eating our way through and honestly only had room for two appetizers as all we had been doing was eating. Sooo we each chose one. My mom chose the chorizo con queso with roasted veggies (non-official name, but that's what it was) which you serve in fresh tortillas...and I mean YUM....cheese topped with chorizo served with tortillas and flavors of spicy chilies. MMMMMM. I chose the mini corncake cups with roasted pulled pork. YUMMMM. There were 4 of these and we were in heaven. The corn cake was slightly fried then filled with the pork and so good. We also ordered the chips and salsa which were of course freshly made and just a slight amount of salsa, red and green. Good not great (Sorry Rick).
