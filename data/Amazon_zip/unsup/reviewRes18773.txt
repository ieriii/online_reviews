Quite possibly the best burger of my life: Venison burger with melted onion, smoked gouda, fried jalapeo, woodland mushroom, pickled onion, red wine ketchup, mustard aioli ... shook my head in wonder with every other bite. Will be back for that burger. That, and the excellent selection of bourbons and beers. To say I loved this place would be a serious understatement.
