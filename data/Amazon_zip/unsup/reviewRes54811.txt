I am always in search of a good breakfast place and I have tried a few which were deemed the best, but after eating at Meli cafe and juice bar last weekend, i have a favorite new breakfast/brunch spot! This is the best! Perfect atmosphere, friendly staff, good service. Coffee was perfect, juice blends were divine,smoothies were delicious! I ordered the strawberry waffle and my husband had the Meli toast. It was light, tasty and delightful! We are craving to come back!
