Gino's was great. I mean really great. My hotel gave me a coupon to skip the line (do this, you won't be sorry) and I was seated immediately at the bar. The menu was huge! I couldn't begin to decide what to get. I finally decided on the chicken parmesian after talking with the bartender about my milk issue. After he got my drink, my salad appeared. For an appetizer salad, this was huge. A giant bed of lettuce with tomato, onion, olive, croutons, and carrots. It was hard to keep it all on my plate. I knew that if I ate too much I wouldn't eat my dinner. And out it came. A humongous bowl of noodles and chicken with pieces of garlic bread on the side. It was delicious. The way real spaghetti sauce should taste. After dinner I ordered a cannoli, even though the bartender said it was pie shaped and not rolled. But guess what, it was rolled. The ricotta cheese was so smooth, different from the ricotta at Brocatto's. I brought it back tot he hotel and ate it while I iced my knees. I was so full, but I couldn't stop eating it! Really great. I went there a few days later for lunch with a coworker and had the Baked Mostaccioli with an italian sausage. The sausage was delicious. One of the best I've had. The pasta was good, but was plane without the sausage. They were out of cannoli's, I would have gotten one to bring home.
