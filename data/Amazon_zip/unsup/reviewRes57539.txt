One word: ROMANTIC. The entire atmosphere is set up for a great intimate evening. The three courses will completely stuff you, and it's something that is a little different. Not every restaraunt you basically cook your own fooe. The Fondue itself is just fun! The add some wine, mood lighting, and cozy corners and you get again-ROMANTIC. Perfect for dates or a sweet night out!
