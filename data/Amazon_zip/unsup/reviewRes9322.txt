I dined here with my "supper club" last Saturday (three girlfriends who like to eat at nice restaurants, swap plates, snag sips of each other's drinks and share desserts). Of the four of us, none of us had ever been to Le Colonial, which is odd because it seems like the only places none of us have been to are brand spanking new. I was very impressed. The cocktails were all very fresh and tasty. We shared the chicken and crimini mushroom ravioli (made with rice noodles), the monkfish on sesame crackers and the cold spicy beef salad as appetizers.  All were excellent, but I particularly loved the beef salad. Chilled tenderloin, tons of fresh veggies and a spicy lemongrass dressing worked really well. For entrees, we shared the roasted duck with chili-lime sauce, the roasted chicken with lemongrass and the BBQ pork with thin noodles. The chicken and duck were delicious (albeit the duck was a bit overdone). The BBQ pork noodles were a disappointment. The pork was tasty enough, but the noodles were clumped together and totally flavorless. We shared the chocolate mousse cake for dessert. Meh. Service was very good, and we had a great table in the front window. I would definitely go back, and I'd definitely skip the pork!
