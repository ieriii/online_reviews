Went with a friend to catch up over brunch after not seeing one another in ages. It was great to see my friend and catch up on all that had happened in our lives over the last couple of years but ZED451 was not as good as I remembered it being in the past. Everything at the buffet was good and I love that they have a huge crock of oatmeal. The drinks seemed average this time although we also just ordered brunch basics... I had the Bloody Mary and she ordered a Mimosa so there's really only so far you can go with either. However, I was not impressed by the food that was actually brought to our table. It seemed especially salty and there were only a couple I liked.. Not amazing and I definitely wasn't wowed but still a reasonable time... much of which was the result of the company. I feel like ZED451 has (or a least had) the potential for greatness but whatever thrill may have once existed is slipping.
