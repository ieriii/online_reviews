a genuine delight. friendly service. high quality food. I had crab cakes benedict, my girlfriend the seafood salad. both were excellent. good enough to make you wanna stand up and smack your mom in the mouth.  that, and it was a busy sunday afternoon on the first warm day of the year. we were still very well taken care of. go eat here. well worth the trip!!
