A wonderful, classic Chicago restaurant. I have never found a better seafood restaurant than Shaw's. Their lobster bisque is the best, a huge selection of oysters, and great fish entrees that you'd be hard pressed to find elsewhere. For instance, I have not seen walleye on any menu outside of Canada! A great find if you're into seafood.
