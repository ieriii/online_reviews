Damn, that was one fine veggie burrito. Who would have thought that a burrito without meat could taste so good. And who would have thought that I, a devout carnivore, would be gushing about a vegetarian meal! In all honesty, had I not been out with the veggie supper club, I would probably have ordered a pepito (steak sandwich) or the rib eye steak casado. But in the spirit of the occasion I decided to go vegetarian. Omar, the very personable waiter/host/manager, suggested the burrito with sauteed mushrooms. Thanks for the tip, Omar. Your kitchen did wonders with the mix of black beans, rice, avocado, cheese, mushrooms & hot peppers. I only managed to make it through half my burrito. Perhaps it was the abundance of chips and salsa on the table, or the bean dip that Omar had us sample. Or more likely, it was the large creamy oatmeal shake that I greedily downed with my meal. Whatever the reason, I had enough burrito left over for lunch. Oh no, that's two vegetarian meals in a row! I need to go get myself some meat stat before this veggie thing becomes a habit.
