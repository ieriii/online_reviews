If it weren't for the pizza, I wouldn't recommend Calo's at all. It is absolutely NOT authentic. Had the Carbonara with peas and Pancetta was instead pasta bathing in a bad Alfredo sauce with burnt bacon and a couple of peas. Alfredo is NOT authentic Italian, and doesn't belong in Carbonara. Have had other pastas there, and other than the enormous amount of food they serve - it's pretty blah... Salads seemed to have just come out of the freezer, as cucumbers were frozen and we waited for them to warm before diving in. Services was slow, usually not available, only bus service was quick. Have had their pizza in the past, and enjoyed it thoroughly. Haven't had the ribs, but I am told they are good. Decor is nice.  Not sure there aren't 5 or 6 other Andersonville restaurants I would rather spend my money at.
