This place is the best. Period. The dogs are not the quintissential Chicago-salad-on-a-bun (although you can order one). The dogs are simply the finest in creative, delicious, encased meats. I had a sausage made out of bacon, topped with herbed butter and fried battered onion bits. I've had fries, fried in delicious duck fat. I had a sausage made of rattlesnake, and it was good! Don't be scared though you scardy cats, there are delicious corn dogs and normal dogs too. Come here on a weekday if you can, the line is out the door on weekends. Hours are kind of strange, but this is the best 'dog place in the city.
