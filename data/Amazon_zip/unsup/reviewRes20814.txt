I went to the Gage last night to celebrate the end of the school sememster for my friend JJ. There was about 10 of us overall. I thought the place was well decorated and the service was phenomenal. Very good wine selection by the glass. It definitely has more polish and bravdo than the other "after work" bars in the loop. The only downside is that it gets VERY crowded VERY quickly. By 5:30pm on a Thursday, all the seats and tables in the bar are gone - so get there early!
