I live in Wicker Park, but only have been here a few times since I can only make it on weekends and the wait is always long! That's my only issue with the place. Aside from that, I've had both breakfast and lunch items and I've been pleased each time. The service is good, and the food is solid leaving you satisfied. Even though I do enjoy Bongo Room, I don't feel that it's absolutely "out of this world" amazing to the point of how busy they get.
