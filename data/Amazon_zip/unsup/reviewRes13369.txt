What an excellent place! My lady and I had dinner here with out of town friends and couldn't have asked for a better evening. We went on a Monday at 8pm. Prime time for a late dinner, but relaxed because it was Monday. To start we had oysters rockefeller, calamari, and mussels. Each of us then had a fish for the main dish. I appreciated that each main course selection comes balanced with vegetables and that the menu not only offered seafood but many local lake fish options. For dessert we all shared a slice of Hoosier Mama pie. The food was damn tasty. The appetizers came in generous portions and main plates were just the right size. Despite finishing everything I didn't feel stuffed. My only "complaint" is that the clam chowder is not what I expected. It tasted like bacon, barely clam, and was luke warm. It did, however, have a nice celery crunch. Don't get me wrong -- it didn't taste bad, it just wasn't what I'd call a clam chowder. The atmosphere at Glenns is cozy casual, and on a Monday it was chill. I don't think I'd try to hit this place later in the week than Wednesday, however, as I'm sure it becomes packed. I would love to try it for brunch some day because their breakfast menu looks good, plus they have cereal (huh?)! P.S. I'd give it 4.5 stars if I could
