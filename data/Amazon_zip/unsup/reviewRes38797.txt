Grape vines rhythmically draping from the ceiling, fresh salad bar and repeat clientele of mostly the wise and frugal. La Villa hasn't let me down after two visits in the past three months. Yes, location with ample free parking spaces. Yes that it is worth your drive from pretty Bucktown, or pretty little Boystown too, my friends. Salad bar, great meal that will only be warmly balanced by the staff who act like they are actually enjoying themselves. Live music of the accordion and keyboard kind, can't beat this place. This cordial and gregarious owner never lets me down, first bruschetta, this time tiramisu. Celebrate something here, but always leave with the best doggie bag that will be lucky to see dawn of tomorrow.
