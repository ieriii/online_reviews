I absolutely love Sapori! First of all, if you sign up for their mailing list, you will get coupons in the mail and a special coupon for your birthday. The food is excellent. I love the Rigatoni Caprese-so good! The servers are great and the host is too. He recognizes his regulars, and has even sent us free tiramisu just for coming back. The tiramisu is awesome-and I don't even like tiramisu normally. Overall a great place.
