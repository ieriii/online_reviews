Had dinner here last night. Amazing. I was nervous as I had read some bad reports about service, but we had no problems. The bussing service was amazing -- Alberto was Awesome. Jennifer, our waitress, was really friendly and knowledgeable. They seem to have maybe one or two few waiters for the number of tables, but Jennifer always said "thanks for waiting" if she took slightly too long to get back to us, so you knew she was doing her best. On to the food. OOoooh the food. Wow. My bf had two oysters, which he loved (the kumamoto and the beau soleil), we then had the mussels.. wow. We actually just got back from a trip to Belgium and these mussels knocked the socks off of any that we had (and paid a lot more for) in Belgium. They are cooked in gueze, a type of belgian lambic, and herbs and i could have drank the sauce straight it was so delicious. We next had the veal brain. Outstanding again. And we ended with the rillettes. I am a huge fan of rillettes and this one did not let me down. we both thought it worked better without the bread, perhaps slicing the bread slightly thinner would work better, but it was still spectacular. We were also both really impressed with the beer menu. They have a lot of great beers on draught and tap and the draughts are pretty reasonably priced (~5-7 dollars). We ended the evening with the waffle (As suggested by Alberto :) ). It had an excellent texture, crispy but very light and fluffy inside, and some dessert wine that was also superb. Overall i can't say enough about this place. i am already excited to go back. Hooray for The Publican!
