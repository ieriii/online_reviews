This is my favorite sushi restaurant in Chicago! Its lively, affordable, BYOB, and offers some of the tastiest sushi in the city without having to pay Randolph Street prices. The environment is great for all types of occassions and parking is decent around the restaurant. I've had just about every maki roll on the menu and I think they're all good depending on your tastes. The quality of the fish is excellent, but I won't say its the best I've had in Chicago. I personally love sashimi and I will attest that theirs is fresh...just not top of the line. The only major downfall is that its a victim of its own success and the lack of a diner-friendly reservation system can make it difficult to get a table at times. However, I firmly believe that the overall value, BYOB policy, and hip decor make this place a slam dunk and a great experience for sushi lovers.  Again, if you go on Fri or Sat night, expect to wait as you would any other popular restaurant. I almost exclusively go there during the week now to avoid crowds and get more personalized service.
