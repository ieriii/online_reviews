Best, most affordable sushi in the neighborhood! Love the high-energy staff and menu selection. It's BYOB with no corkage fee and the specials are amazing. I go with friends all the time, but would LOVE to go on a date there(if I can ever get one!!) They deliver farther than most places would, which is awesome. I really have nothing bad to say about Coast whatsoever! I F%#@!N LOVE IT!
