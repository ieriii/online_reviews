Demera was my first foray into Ethiopian cuisine and it was an OK beginning for me. Luckily I had some experience friends along with me on this trip and they handled the ordering for us. I enjoyed most of the dishes that we had on the tray and was also glad to try each others selections. The bread used to pickup your food wasn't as bad as I thought so I was pleased with that. The restaurant itself wasn't bad and the service was very good. It wasn't that busy on this trip which may have contributed to easy service although it took away from a Friday nights ambiance.
