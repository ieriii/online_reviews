This place is either another Cheesecake Factory in disguise or a theme park and zoo - actually, I think it's both. Cavernous restaurant with good views overlooking Michigan Ave and menu near exactly the same as it's sister CF. We shared the Diablo Chicken which was really salty but good, and the Warm Rustic Apple Pie which was really an apple galette. The portions are absolutely enormous, and the dishes aren't fancy, loaded with salt and sugar, so it's hard to go wrong.
