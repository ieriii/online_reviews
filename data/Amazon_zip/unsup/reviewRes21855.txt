Superdawg - You either love it, or hate it. Whatever your choice, it IS a Chicago instution worthy of at least one stop. I personally have been going to Superdawg for years. Yes, it's not cheap, but I really love the dogs, and it's hard to find a good hot dog place around this area. I love the drive and park. You can order from the car or go to the small receiving window (yeah, it's tight). It's nostalgia and kitsch at it's best. What you don't know is that it was written in the insurance that if anything happened to Superdawg (the building) it would be constructed EXACTLY the same way if rebuilt. And they did have a fire many years back which gutted the place. And it WAS rebuilt to exactly the same specifications! I hope it'll get landmark status sometime. It's worth it.
