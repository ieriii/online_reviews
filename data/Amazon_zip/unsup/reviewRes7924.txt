If I recall, Fogo was the first Brazilian steakhouse in Chicago. I've been to Sal & Carvao, but still prefer Fogo. I was in Brazil a few months ago and went to 2 churrascarias there. Fogo is definitely authentic and can swing with the best ones in Brazil. Caipirinhas - try one, maybe two, but stop there. These drinks are strong! Obviously go there hungry. Vegans should skip this place ("light" eaters too). Lunch is a great deal. My only critique is that I wished they also served some type of fish, like Sal & Carvao does.
