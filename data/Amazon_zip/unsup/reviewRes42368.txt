The food was absolutely delicious... Being a vegetarian, I often have a hard time ordering at the more "trendy" restaurants however I found the menu to be VERY vegetarian friendly. We had the flat bread, the fennel salad, the pasta, the salmon and the brownie and everything was made and cooked to perfection. We were truly blown away by the how tasty all the food was. HIGHLY recommended.
