Pho Xe Tang or Tank, as you'd like to be called sometimes. Oh how much I crave you in the City of Wind. When the weather turns on us and we're chilly inside and out, you fill me up with delicious beef noodle soup. Whenever I feel a cold or hungry but don't have a lot to spend on food, I want you oh so much. I always get their #47- Pho Tai, Yes, I know the number by heart because that's how often I go! I'm usually not into ordering something I can easily make at home but I love their version of fried rice # 122 it's awesome~ Their crepes are a bit too greasy but I go to Tank to get my pho on so~~~ Don't be surprised if you get seated next to people you've never seen before. If there's table space and empty seats, that's where you'll be seated.
