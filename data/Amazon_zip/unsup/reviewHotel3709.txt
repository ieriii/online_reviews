Wow. This place just oozes elegance. I've heard of the Drake in movies, and have known some people that have stayed here, but I've never been here myself. And now that I have, anytime I'm invited I will be sure to show up. For a couple reasons. 1) Because you know that the food is going to be good. 2) Anytime you come here especially with a date or on a date I'm pretty sure you're gonna get some just based on general principal. 3) It actually feels good to go somewhere that you pass by so often on LSD, and that has so much historical significance. The restaurant inside is the famous Coq D'or. This is where Joe DiMaggio and Marylin Monroe carved their names into one of the booths. I came here for a little private wedding reception in room 550 which is the Princess Diana suite. And yes it does look fit for a princess. The view is out to lsd and the beach, and the bedroom is just about the same square footage as my last apartment. But when I think about if I would stay here... probably not. It's in an area where gucci and louis vitton are right across the street. So not only will it be a pretty penny, but it will also piss you off when you walk out the door and see an old couple expect you to wait in line behind them just because they have old money. So for the same price you will get a larger room at let's say the wit or the sofitel. But if you're in the area walk into the lobby and go back to the 50's and 60's. You almost feel like an expectation to see Kathleen Turner and Dustin Hoffman to walk through the lobby from the graduate.
