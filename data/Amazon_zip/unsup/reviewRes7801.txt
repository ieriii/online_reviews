::turns the card over to green:: Fogo de Chao fulfills every meat-lover's dream. We're talking non-stop meat action, with several cuts of beef, lamb, pork, chicken, and sausages to choose from. This place reminds you why gluttony can be sinfully good sometimes. Ok, let's start off with the sides. I love the warm cheese puffs, which are similar to gougeres. The crispy polenta, fried bananas, and mashed potatoes are all excellent sides, as well. The salad bar is huge, with a nice selection of cheeses, roasted vegetables, olives, and cured meat. Pace yourself, my friend, because you have a full evening ahead of you.  Now on to the MEAT. My favorite cut is the Picanha, which is a cut of sirloin seasoned with sea salt and garlic. They also have rib eye, filet mignon, top sirloin, bottom sirloin, beef ribs, leg of lamb, pork ribs, bacon-wrapped chicken breast, and pork sausages. Turn your card over to red when you've had enough meat (for now..) There are several other Brazilian steakhouses to choose from in Chicago, but this one still tops my list.
