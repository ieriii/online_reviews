Fantastic place with amazing burgers and one of the better beer lists I've seen in a while. At least 10 burger options on the list and I've heard there are more coming. I don't know how I ever ate a burger without a pretzel bun and any other burger I now eat, I say "this would be great with a pretzel bun" (I know this isn't a revolutionary thing, but bear with my lack of burger experience). I recommend the Red Dragon which has an egg, brisket hash, and a good amount of spice. Elvis' Last Supper is great with the peanut butter and bacon. Another spread I wouldn't have tried on my own for burgers, but definitely have brought home. The fries are decent, not super, but the variety of seasonings is pretty cool. The beer menu is extensive and everything I've tried on it is delicious. I'm pretty sure they'll still do beer flights if you can't make up your mind. I do have to say, however, that due to either my taste in beers being similar to many people or lack of inventory space, I've twice ordered beers that were out. Very minor, but still slightly discouraging. Overall, one of my favorite restaurants in Chicago.
