Superdawg really does live up to all the hype. Never have I been disappointed when popping open that blue cardboard box to find my Superdawg comfortably lounging on a bed of Superfries. Outside of the dog itself, which is top=notch, the fries are crispy-greasy-salty good. The onion chips rock, and to wash it all down, nothing is better than a pineapple milkshake. While I do feel stupid sometimes traveling to pay almost five bucks for a dog in the City of Hot Dogs, this is one of the few places that's truly worth it.
