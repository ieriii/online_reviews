I had experienced fabulous Paella in Chicago before and thought I would try someplace new. I was very disappointed. I found the tapas served very small in portion and just mediocre. For $12 I got 3 tiny calamari rings, seriously? The Paella was waaay too salty, looked a bit like rice a roni and the chorizo looked and smelled suspiciously like kalbasa. My husband and I are serious foodies and love The Iron Chef. This food was not iron chef worthy. For $100, I could have whipped up a much more fabulous feast. If you like to pay a lot of money for small portions of just ok food, this place will impress you. I will not return.
