Amazing food and great service! The menu was a bit overwhelming but our server was very helpful and knowledgeable. We got lucky and got seated right away. We got there at 3pm and the place was already full. Great wine selection. We ended up order several small plates and was very very satisfied. And the prices were very reasonable (even with alcohol). Definite must-go in Chicago.
