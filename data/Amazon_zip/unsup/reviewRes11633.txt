this place ALWAYS has a line out the door. on a nice summer weekend morning i usually dont mind. but im usually not patient enough to wait for over an hour before i can be seated. but if you do get in. its one of my most favorite places for brunch. my friends and i usually get their "special" pancakes to share for the table. we've had the chocolate chip banana & strawberry chocolate chip. both are awesome. i tend to go for more of an eggy brunch and their omelets are great. good service. great vibe in the restaurant. so if you have the patience, id definitely give it a shot.
