In a few words, great brunch joint. A key point is the space. I hate restaurants, especially breakfast places, that over-pack their space with tables and booths on top of each other. You can hear 3 separate conversations at the same time. The Lakeview Wishbone has ample space and you're not bumping into servers and other patrons when trying to sit or leave. They definitely use good ingredients, which results in good food. I had the crunchy french toast (french toast covered with cornflakes) and sausage. Pretty good portions too. And lastly, Wishbone is kid friendly. There's a toy store right next door (on Belmont) which you can bribe your kids with. Tell them that if they act properly at brunch, "you will go browse in the toy store afterwards." Remember, you never said "I will buy you something." Would definitely recommend, and try again; maybe next time for dinner.
