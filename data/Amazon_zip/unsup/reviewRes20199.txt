Coast is an amazing place. It can get very busy here on a weekend night so make a reservation or get there earlier. I think the longest I've waited was 2 hours, but it is well worth it. Coast is BYOB so feel free to bring some good wine and champagne. It has a very intimate setting, so it's good for a date or to just socialize with a group of friends. The staff will give their best recommendations if you need them as well. I visit this place frequently and I've never had a bad experience.
