We stayed here during our wedding weekend: 11.21.08-11.24.08. We had many questions in prepping for this stay, and our contact, Ann, always responded quickly and almost always with a happy result. Our suite was large, clean, and brand-new. The bedding was very comfortable, the whirlpool tub was great, and the TVs were awesome (although barely used). We appreciated the use of the steamer for my dress, the free internet and the tray of fruits and champagne. We enjoyed the carolers and extra Holiday cheer in the lobby. It was a shame that the renovations were not able to be completed, though it is beautiful all the same. And everyone was very friendly to us. And, of course, the location is unbeatable. The room was a lacking a few things, such as a hook tall enough for a wedding dress, good bathroom lighting and quiet ventilation. Also, a maid had left the door open when we left for over an hour (the deadbolt was engaged, so the door could not close). That could have ended very badly for us. Thankfully, all was fine, and they were able to compensate us satisfactorily for the scare, although it took some work to get to that point. We look forward to staying with you next year - hopefully, in warmer weather, so we can take advantage of the beach.
