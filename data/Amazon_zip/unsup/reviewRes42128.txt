Ok, so I will admit it, I heard about this place on Check Please. Yeah, I'm coming to terms with being that guy. But with Pho, all you need is a clean restaurant, loads of locals, great Pho and I'm there. We've found ourselves there at least once a week chowing down on the pho and spring rolls for an amazingly delicious and inexpensive meal. We'll keep going back again and again...I'm hooked!
