I haven't been to the Wrigleyville restaurant, but the one on Devon has become a regular for my wife and I. We like to meet the kids there, who live in Andersonville, it's a nice halfway point. It's trendy enough, healthy, and sustainable local farming, with a garden/farm on their roof where they grow many of their own herbs and greens, for the kids. The restaurant is warm, and pretty. They have a back room where they have music sometimes. We were seating in the "music" room once, when they were having a babyshower and singing to the new mother from the stage... (a little weird... we felt like they were intruding, especially when they started passing the "hat" for donations to the new family... yikes!) The food is delicious, I've never had a bad meal there. It's a little "pricey" for the amount of food you receive, but tasty as heck.
