I don't even know where to begin!! Not only I had the best hot dogs/sausages of my life here, it would not be an exaggeration if I said it was one of the best meals I've ever had! Waiting in a line that was going out and almost around the block for more than 45 minutes was absolutely worth it! We put a lot of thinking into which four from the amazing options to pick and one turned out to be more delicious after the other! I consider it almost a crime against humanity that they don't open other branches elsewhere! A must to check out when you're in Chicago! Just make sure you don't put any catchup on your hog dog, because Chicagoans don't take kindely of such!
