We were excited after reading stellar reviews about this Iron Chef owned restaurant. We had selected this restaurant since it claims to be the only Catalan tapas restaurant in the city... Mercat a la Planxa does not serve what the other Tapas restaurant in the city have - in fact, we were very impressed with the flavor and presentation of each and every one of them. 4 stars for the food. However, we were utterly unimpressed with the service. I can understand a laid back style to service or I can understand if the server is busy with a full dining room. However, when neither is the case and when you are paying a relatively higher premium for the food, the expectation is elevated. As a result, I will not be returninig soon.
