Decor was interesting...we got to sit in the wooden enclosed booths with doors that swing out. Not sure the story behind that, but a couple times it was a bit hazardous as people were walking by and one of our waiters tried to open it to take away plates or serve food.  Definitely order a beer. They are known for their beers. I thought it was really neat that for each beer, they paired it with the appropriate glass/logo. Our waiter was very knowledgeable about all the beers so just tell them what you tend to like and they'll make a recommendation. The Blanche Bruxelle was light and went down quickly. Food was good although at first glance of the menu, you probably aren't sure what to order. With 5 people, we ordered PLENTY of food to share including the oysters, frites with egg, salad, selection of 3 hams, fish of the day, halibut, pickles, cassoulet, pork shoulder...the list goes on and on. We all LOVED the frites with egg and actually ended up ordering a second batch at the end of the meal because we kept raving about them. The pork shoulder was a bit dry and over-cooked, so we got the waffle and dessert liquour on the house. My mouth is watering thinking about the waffle with liqour as I'm writing this! Great place to come with co-workers and group of people so you can try different dishes.
