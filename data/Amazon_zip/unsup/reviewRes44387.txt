I had a pumpkin cupcake from here and it was soooo not worth the $3+ I paid for it. Tiny, not very moist and lacking in flavor. I don't get the hype. My search for the perfect cupcakes continues... :( I also tried some pumpkin pie from here on Thanksgiving and found it to be good, but average. It probably cost way more than it should have. And yeah, the workers are a bit standoffish and pretentious, but it's in Wicker Park, so what do you expect?
