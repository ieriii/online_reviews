I've eaten a ton of great meals at a ton of great restaurants, and let me tell you, Sprout is the real deal. The only thing i can compare it to was my last dining experience at Trio before it closed (sigh). The food is a hug from the inside, the service is exceptional, the room is warm and inviting, the wine list is well thought out, and jesus... i'm still in a food coma the next day! Bold, fresh, crazy-good flavors that elevated things like a simple salad and a sip of soup to what you're probably gonna smell on God's breath when he meets you at the pearly gates. I no longer hate licorice thanks to this restaurant... go there and figure out what i mean. I'm a former Chicago peep, now dwelling in Indiana, and there's a new reason to make the trek back. Sorry, Charlie, but Lincoln Park has way more game in the hood! Eat here or deny yourself... you choose.
