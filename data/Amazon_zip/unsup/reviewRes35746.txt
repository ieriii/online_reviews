Coming from SF, this place aint bad. From a traditional cuisine point of view... #1) Sea bass, its not the whole fish steamed, just a large circular cross section of the fish.. i was hoping to eat the head but it was served western style, so no head or no body. The flavors of the steamed fish and scallions was right on. #2) Soft shell crab, pretty good - its a blue crab during molting stage battered and fried. Served with wok seared peppers and onions. #3) Fish ball soup with watercress. The fish balls are home made ( non-freezer kind) and broth made from bone vs bullion. I would say this is authentic and delicious #4) Beef with Chinese broccoli. Its ok.. looking forward to next time.
