Bin 36 reminds me of home (SF). Great wine, great cheese selection, and who can go wrong with pork belly?! Yum. The waiter recommended a really tasty Malbec and got us out the door in time for our show at the House of Blues. My only complaint is that the online menu featured foie gras, which I was intent on ordering. Unfortunately, the online menu is out of date. Boo for that, but yay for the food and wine! Too bad I'm a grad student now...otherwise I'd be here all the time getting drunk on good wine and fat on good cheese.
