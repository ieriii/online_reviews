we walked in for dinner for a group of 4 without reservations, took about 45 minutes to seat us, came in around 8:30 and sat at about 9:15 or 9:30 While we were waiting to be seated had a few drinks at the bar, did not care for the bartender, he wasn't friendly and did not provide good service. Now on to the food, amazing! Everything was delicious, I had the grilled calamari with Shrimp, my husband had the pasta with mushrooms and asparagus and our friends had pizza and ravioli. Everyone loved their dishes, I will definitely be going back.
