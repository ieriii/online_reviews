This is a really poor choice for brunch with friends. Like most places, they won't seat you before your entire party arrives. There's not really a good place to wait, but if there's space, you might be able to sit at the bar. The bigger problem is that, once you're a complete party, there really aren't any tables for groups over 4 (only a few of those) and once you've gotten a table, you'll still have to wait in line to order. They are SERIOUS about getting people out quickly, and have no patience for sitting around after you're finished eating. You tip when you order (even though there's no table service) so there's no consequence for rudeness while you eat. It's loud and tight, and not a great place to sit and chat. I went there with some friends recently and found it pretty unpleasant. The food was fine, but not worth all the hassle.
