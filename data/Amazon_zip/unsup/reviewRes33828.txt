Dear Sultan's, I love you. You are so wicked cheap. You are so wicked tasty. I love your falafel sandwich and how the dude hacks up my falafel balls with such vengeance. The cash register man means business and wants you to hurry the f up and pick out your f'ing drink already so he can ring you up and move on, but he never says it out loud. Only with his eyes.  Thank you for not jacking up your prices astronomically and ripping us off just because you can. xoxo, Elizabeth
