I have been to Yolk a few times and each time I have gone, I like it better. Getting seated on a weekend anywhere in the city for brunch is a process, but the turnover and wait for Yolk is not too bad. We came there after a race, and it hit the spot. Service was good, food very good (made some changes to the order and there was not a problem). The only 2 things I didn't like is the fact that while you are waiting, if you want coffee - you have to buy it separately...some brunch places give you coffee when you wait and are just charged once when you sit down. Second thing is parking is very difficult in that are. I would definitley go again if I am in the area. Ambiance is good - bright and cheery.
