Yes, another glowing review for Violet Hour. Thursday night, 745pm, no line, three of us were seated at the bar right away. I had no clue what drink to order, since almost all of them feature words that I did not understand (like matsusalem or St. Elizabeth Allspice Dram).  The bartender gave me a taste of a rum I was asking about, and then helped me choose a delicious drink- Walsh's Rule. Y-u-m. I recommend it for people who like tasty, not too too sweet drinks. Before I even took my first sip of the deliciousness, I decided that I loved the place. I loved everything about it... though if I had had to wait, I might not feel so warm and fuzzy.  Like others have said, it costs $12 for each of these incredible drinks, so I can't afford to come too often, but WOW, for my first experience with craft cocktails, I was so impressed. Don't go to meet people. Go to have great conversation and feel a million miles from your busy Chicago life.  One added bonus that saved me like $115: I was running late and parked in the 7-11/Lou Malnati's lot right next to Violet Hour. I looked around for lingering tow-company people watching to bust bar-goers like me and didn't see anyone. This friendly-looking guy near the door (I never would've guessed he was the towing informant!) said, "Miss, I saw you leave your car in the lot, and I am the guy who has to call the company, and I wanted to let you move your car." I was amazed, and found a spot a block away. Thank you, friendly towing informant!!!! I will pay it forward :) May you have the great time that I did at this fine establishment!
