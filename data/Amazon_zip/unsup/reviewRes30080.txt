I give it four stars for what I think it's trying to be - a sort of laid-back coffee shop that I imagine existed in the Vienna of 100 years ago. If you're expecting a super-hip, modern cafe, you're in the wrong place. Located on quiet Dearborn Street in the heart of the Gold Coast, this place is usually heavy with studying students and locals in for a bite. They have coffee, of course, but also a full bar and nicely prepared cafe-type foods. When I lived a block away, I used to eat there a lot and just chill with something to read and some coffee. I still like to eat there after doing stuff in Lincoln Park (like after the Air Show) or when I want to just relax and have decent food and good drinks.
