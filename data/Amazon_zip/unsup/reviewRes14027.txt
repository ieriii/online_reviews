Great selection of fresh seafood! Have been here about 5 times and always leave full (too full) and happy. Try the shrimp in cheese (can't remember the name)appetizer it will change your life!! Try to call for a reservation, they get busy and the wait can be awhile. also BYOB which is always great!!
