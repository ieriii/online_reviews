pros: - incredibly nice staff. - relaxing atmosphere - good location cons: - the food is just bland. - long wait between order and fork - expensive $$$. - unremarkable dishes. 3 of the 4 plates we ordered required "green goddess dressing" for any flavor, which i could purchase and pour on fried foods myself with the same effect. the "farm cheese" appetizer was a trumped-up cheese log. maybe we would have been more impressed with entrees over 22$, but when we kept the food under 20$ each it was slow and disappointing.
