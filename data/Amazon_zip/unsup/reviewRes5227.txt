I really truly and honestly want to give Purple Pig 5 stars. However, the last two times I have been there the service has been beyond poor. Now granted the place was busy, very busy in fact and sitting at the bar, menu in hand looking left and right at couples also sitting drink less and food less with menu in hand , who had been sitting there much longer than I had didn't help... I wanted some delicious food dagnabbit!  I wanted a glass of French Rose and some creamy decadent bone marrow, I wanted those fabulous deviled eggs, I needed, I desired, I have been there many times before, I know the charms of roasted cauliflower, I yearned for beets! Sadly, after 25 minutes with not even a nod from a bartender, I walked out.  Oh I will go back, not at happy hour, not on a Friday, maybe on a nice unassuming Tuesday. Because the place deep inside me that craves a really good cheese plate will demand it.
