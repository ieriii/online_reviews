This is one badassmutherfucker. Pardon my French, but it really is. Jam packed, long waits, but all quite rewarding. I won't tell you how to pull off making the long wait bearable (it has something to do with having a friend that lives down the street and a telephone). Once you are in you can just turn the speed meter off and take it all in. They have a Michelin star for christ sake! If you know any thing about Michelin stars and table cloths you will really understand how truly impressive that feat is. Food combination's range from simple, buffalo style frog legs with aerated blue cheese to a diabolical dish of, agnoloti with truffle, chanterelles and what I can only describe as mushroom mouse.  Some will say this dish was a bit overpowering, but I had a very hoppy ale at the suggestion of my waiter and it was a triumph of flavor and texture.  A duck entree was also a testament of skill, a rare breast alongside the best version of confit I can remember, the secondary components escape me, but I remember being blown away throughout. Cocktails are hand crafted and outstanding, much better than many in the city for $5 more. When my waiter asked how things were half way through I actually asked, "are you fucking kidding me." Not very restrained, but I believe showing excitement when it is still exciting and this restaurant is exciting.
