Was a 1.5 hour wait for the four of us, at 630 on a Saturday nite, so definitely expect the wait. There is a wine bar across the street, so can always wait there before. The restaurant will call your cell once you can be seated. Definitely an inviting space, good for 4-5 friends. Energy in the room was awesome and non pretentious. Food was decent, but not beyond ordinary. Loved the prosciutto & arugula pizza, the melted mozzarella cheese. No seared octopus, bummer. Could have used warmer service as well. The waitress was really just okay. Worth the first time wait, but not sure if I'll go back.
