I went back again over the weekend. Tasty, yes! But, super greasy, oh hell yeah! The salt & pepper shrimp is just ok and the garlic chinese broccoli was slathered in oil. I love chinese broccoli. However, it was difficult to chow down on it when it's so oily. Tony's Chicken was as delicious as ever, though.
