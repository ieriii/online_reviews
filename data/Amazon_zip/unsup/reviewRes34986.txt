There are things about sushi X that could possibly cause me to give it a lower rating, such as, the cramped atmosphere when you dine in, or the mediocre vegetable tempura, but the Buddha roll is the most amazing sushi that I have ever tasted- very filling, full of flavor, and continuously keeps me coming back for more. I have gotten take out here and it is just as good, but I am a fan of the service. When you have to wait in the cramped space on a crowded weekend night, you are reminded of how glad you are that you did wait, rather go to some mediocre sushi place, with sub-par impersonal service. I crave Sushi X constantly, unfortunately I don't get it as much as I need it. Sushi X Buddha roll is the drug I am on way to addiction with.
