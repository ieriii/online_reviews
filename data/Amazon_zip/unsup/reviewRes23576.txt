I wish I knew were all the raves come from for this place, maybe i've just been unlucky. Last time I was there my sister and I ordered the ceviche, on her past experience. Man that was awful. It was like limey shoe leather in a sunday cup. Yea, that got sent back. The other items we ordered (heart of palm salad, yuca, some shakes) for the meal were all equally meh. The garlic on the yuca tasted like the pre-minced stuff from a jar. Seriously? Isnt it cheaper to just buy garlic bulbs? I dunno, I really want to like it here... But I can't They get that third star because they are really friendly, and accomodating. I'll give them a chance again once its nice out, so I can enjoy the patio.
