Is it just me, or are the floors SO freaking slippery at this place? My boyfriend and I enjoyed dinner here for the first time with a couple whose family dines here often--and they said their poor grandma is always terrified she'll slip and fall on her arse as she shuffles her way to the table, cane in hand. Alas, that may be the only minus we noticed here. The baked to order desserts were incredible (the beignets were steaming hot and gooey) and the Pasta Fresca I ordered was perfectly seasoned with garlic, olive oil and other mystery spices, and packed with every yummy grilled veggie known to man. My boyfriend's chicken pot pie was amazingly homey and our friends both swear by the chicken parm, which is pounded super-thin, covered in cheese and covers the entire platter-sized dish. I commented to the group that the decor felt strangely like the Cheesecake Factory--only to find out just now they are siblings, so to speak. I did feel like a tourist, but it seems from all these posts that its generally approved by native yelpers.
