Combo meats were excellent (had the skirt steak/ chicken combo). The sides were a letdown as expected from other yelp reviews (loaded them with sauce like some advised and still were too dry to save). The empanada was nothing special and the sangria was bland and missing a decent/ridiculous amount of alcohol. Would return for the meat combo - a good garnish for it is their sliced habenaros.
