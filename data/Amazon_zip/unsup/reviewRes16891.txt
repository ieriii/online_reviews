Heard a lot of hype about this place before actually going.  It was very classy, and seemed very 1920's or something. Great music too. Old jazz, etc. Not a great place for mingling, but mostly as an intimate setting for friends or dates. In fact, it would be a perfect 2nd-destination for a first or second date.  It had a very interesting drink menu. I had the wine cocktail drink. (I can't remember the name of it) which was very good. The deviled eggs were good, and worth the $6 because they're a pain to make. BUT, not as good as my home-made ones ;-) The artisan cheese plate was heavenly. And it better be! for $12, and such small portions. Verdict: Definitely go here for a couple drinks and appetizer if you're visiting Chicago, but I'd suggest getting there early. Like 8:30pm, otherwise I hear there can be a long line to wait in to get in.
