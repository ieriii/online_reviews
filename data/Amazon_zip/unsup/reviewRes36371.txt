PUBLIC HEALTH VIOLATION: I was in the restroom with a waitress and watched as she did NOT wash her hands after doing her business, despite the "employees must wash hands" sign prominently displayed. Also: the wait sucks, and you wait in an obnoxiously loud bar that serves coffee in styrofoam (come on, what year is it?), but you know this from the other reviews. The food is mediocre at best, and it's served without condiments, toast, extras, so it's cold by the time you get everything you need to start the meal (this goes for their coffee service as well). Why do people in Chicago wait this long for not even good food? I don't know, but I won't do it again.
