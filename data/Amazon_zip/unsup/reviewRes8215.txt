Love this authentic Naples Pizza. The place was extremely clean and the pizza oven was equisite. When you walk in, you get the nice view of the authentic pizza oven. Am I a geek for wanting to take a picture with that pizza oven?? I wonder how much it would cost to fly in some authentic Naples brick layers and build me a pizza oven?? We ordered the Pizza Margherita and the Funghi e Salsiccia on this visit. The crust was thin, crunchy, and flavorful. The service was FAST! Obviously when you cook pizzas at that temperature, you can't help but cook pizzas fast.  I can't wait to go back and try a medley of pizzas and maybe crack open some of the Pelligrino at the table! The pizza overall was better than I expected and I look forward to another visit! There are plenty of Prosciutto appetizers and I am a big fan of a real Prosciutto di Parma! I think the next visit (soon) I'll be trying the Bianco Nero, a greta sounding pizza of black truffle, white truffle oil, mushrooms and mozzarella!
