Loved this place, although I'm definitely not wealthy nor attractive enough to hang out in the bar. I'm pretty sure everyone there made my salary in a month, or at least spent the money to look like they did. I can't say the popcorn drove me crazy, but the rest of the menu certainly did.  - Butternut bisque was outstanding. The marshmallow was a unique and delicious accent to the dish. - Cheddar risotto was also quite good, although my wife was jealous of my bisque. Had an entertaining back and forth with the waiter regarding the wagyu beef and shaved truffle topping. He offered me the shaved truffle topping for $10. I said sure. Then he came back and apologized, and said it was $20 (the $10 price was for the prix fixe menu). I said sure again. Then the food came and he told me the kitchen forgot to include the truffle. Then five minutes later he brought a cup of them; apparently the kitchen had not forgotten, but had instead put them on the side. Then the waiter said "It's on the house," and we all had a laugh, but I wanted to pay for them anyway. Nice people. And the wagyu beef was outstanding; the truffle consomme made the dish. My wife got the heritage chicken, which in her opinion looked like "Christmas on a plate." And that's exactly what it looked like. Sort of a deconstructed Thanksgiving meal, or something. Also delicious. Expensive, of course, but well worth it for a special meal.
