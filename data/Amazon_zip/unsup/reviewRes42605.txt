I was really harsh with them last time because their delivery service is just terrible, over an hour to get a pizza 2 blocks down the street. I was really disappointed with it until my friend talked about their chicken. Charbroiled Perdue chickens. Since the weather was warmer and I was starving I walked over to the place and ordered their 1/2 chicken special with no rice, double black beans, it came out to under 10 bucks and it included a drink. It seemed like it was nothing but regulars there as they were chatting up the lady making pizza and the grill man. I just waited around for my food to come out, but I had forgotten to say I wanted it to go. Fortunately, it didn't seem like a problem and my food came out rather quickly. I went back to the apartment and found a container absolutely stuffed with chicken and beans. The chicken was absolutely delicious charred perfectly, spiced just right and it really was half a chicken. The black beans were likewise very good, it was made with bacon and not just little pieces either, thick slices that went well alongside the black beans-let me say I am NOT a fan of beans and I ate these up like they were candy. I don't want to give them 5 stars because of the experience from before but they are definitely a good place to eat. Carry out, not delivery.
