Grand Lux is great. I don't care how "touristy" it is. I'm a local, and I will eat here any day. It's owned by the same company that owns Cheesecake Factory, which I'm not too big on. The menus differ greatly. The dining room space is huge and really cool to look at. I've sat in a few different parts and it is all good. I appreciate the number of booths they have. The service is always good. The menu is large and eclectic. My favorites are the Asian Nachos appetizer (which could almost be a entree), and the Chicken Portofino salad (one of the best salads I have had, with respect to Bandera's Macho Salad.). But I think almost everything is good. For more interesting selections, I would just order appetizers rather than the entrees.
