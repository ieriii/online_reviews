After a $35+ bill for 2 "personal pizzas", i walked out tired and unfulfilled. Tired because we waited for 45+ min for 4 minutes of pizza baking. Unfulfilled because we really got nothing more than $2 of dough and $2 of grass (arugula + basil, but whatever) i don't care much about "energy" or "atmosphere" at a restaurant, i just want to eat. would much rather have a greasy $3 NY slice from Greenwich Village than a $15 brick oven fired pie, especially having been pizza'd (neapolitian, firenzian?, nissarded style?) out during the last Italy trip. Also, mirroring someone's complaint from elsewhere: you really want to be in-the-know with the owner. some people don't get gratis prosseco, some people got to taste gratis apps for enduring the excruciating wait. But others didn't. I hate double standards when I'm paying just as much as the next guy. ** EDIT '08 ** We've been out of Chicago for over 6 months now... I really gotta make amends and admit the Nea pie here is easily 4-5*s. Have had mediocre pies all over LA and the finest here (beyond Pizz Mozz) is only on par with Spacca. Nonetheless, the entire experience of Spacca remains barely 2* .
