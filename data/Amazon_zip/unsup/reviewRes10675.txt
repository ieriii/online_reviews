Anyone who rated this less than 4 stars needs to go to the nearest mirror and smack themselves in the face. Easily top 5 brunch in Chicago that I have tasted, possibly higher. The worst thing you can say about the Bongo Room is that the wait is terrible, but there is a reason for that. The overriding reason to go anywhere in my opinion is TASTE. You may like/dislike atmosphere, service, etc, but taste conquers all. My sister came to visit last summer and she insisted we go both days she was here. Duck breast benedict and the french toast tower broke me down like the critic eating ratatouille in the pixar movie. Say what you will about it being crowded, or maybe your server was grumpy from going out too late the night before, but this is some of the best tasting brunch around.
