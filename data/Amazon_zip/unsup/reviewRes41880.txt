Good Pho here that's why we drove from Great Lakes to here 45 minutes. This place was so crowded and it was worth the wait. I've had better but if your not from the area such as in my situation then this place will fix your pho cravings. It's not the best like I said but better than nothing. There are alot more Pho restaurants in this area but my friend took me here so I just trusted his judgement.
