Looking for fresh and smoky salsa? Huge portions with all the traditional Mexican trimmings? Speedy service in an unpretentious spot? And for a fraction of the price of other joints? Then Nuevo Leon is your kind of place. Don't go there expecting fancy. It's nothing of the sort. The meals are simple, traditional, large and good. Oh and it's BYOB, so don't forget to bring the Modelos (or Coronas...). It's a perfect place when you're craving the real deal and don't want to spend a ton of dinero.
