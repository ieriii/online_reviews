The decor is lovely, staff was friendly and super attentive and the circus-style wine wall was entertaining. The salad bar (where I spent most of my time since I don't eat red meat) is quite lovely. There is a great selection of salad mixings, cheeses, hot soups and sides items. The pork that I had was very tasty. Everyone that I was will had only good things to say about their meal (one meat was particularly salty, but we think it was the style of cooking rather than by mistake). The cheesecake dessert was delicious! In my opinion, there is no way that it can be consumed after a full meal of salad bar and non-stop meat. I suggest taking it home to enjoy after you can feel your toes again from eating so much.
