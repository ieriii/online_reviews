I have friends in high places. Which is very nice when you decide that you want to go out to eat somewhere really swanky..at 7pm..on a holiday. My friends with connections made a few calls and we had no problem. Parking, no problem. Walking in ahead of a long line and lead to a table right away and seated with a smile, no problem. Gotta love that. I was immediately impressed. The decor is sexy, and the atmosphere is super romantic. And then there was the food! We had been out on a boat all day and I had worked up an appetite, so when I sauntered up to the starters tables I did not know what to do with myself. So much to choose from! I could have eaten just that, but no, then came the roving meat. I was so gluttonous that I really cannot remember what I had, but I can tell you that it was all delicious. After dinner we were treated to a tour by a head-honcho. Beautiful private rooms, gorgeous outdoor deck for drinking and socializing.  A place to see and be seen without the regular "ugh" I feel at most places like this. Would love to go on a date here.
