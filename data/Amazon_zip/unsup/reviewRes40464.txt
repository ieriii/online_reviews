I only get the steak tacos, and they are delicious. At one point, I'd developed a ritualized eating holiday based on them (Taco Fridays!). Now, I'm trying to live, so I've cut back. Avoid busy weekends, as I've noticed the quality of the steak goes down sometimes. Either way, good prices and tasty food.
