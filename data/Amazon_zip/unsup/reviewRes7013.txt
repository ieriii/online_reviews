Ok, 5 stars for BBQ? Seriously? This was no everyday barbecue. In fact, there was nothing ordinary about this place at all. The building, the staff, the food, everything was amazing! I'm an average fan of barbecue, if it's good I enjoy it but it's not something I usually crave. It was right down the street from our hotel so based on some good reviews I agreed to try it somewhat reluctantly. Oh what I would have missed if I hadn't gone! First, for the price in Chicago this is definitely a don't miss. It's in a cool old building that's clearly been recently remodeled to feel somewhat upscale but not pretentious. We had ribs, pulled pork, and brisket. All of this comes quickly (they warn you) and served with 3 different and unique sauces. Note: even the mild has a bit of kick so beware if you don't like spicy foods. Also, don't miss the macaroni and cheese. Not quite my grandmas, but pretty darn good! Last, but certainly not least, the Espresso Brittle Ice cream was UNFREAKINBELIEVABLE! Maybe it's because I have a severe weakness for ice cream, but oh-my. The brittle is home made and the perfect blend of buttery crunch and sweet melt in your mouth. Ok, just writing this is making me salivate... do I have a problem? Get this dessert!
