Wow, I don't even know what to say about this place. For starters, my date and I were seated promptly and had the entire process explained to us by the waiter, who was exceptionally helpful. He directed us to the salad bar, which was stocked with various cold meats, cheeses, salads, and sides. Along with the salad bar, there was a soup of the day, hot sides, and a sushi bar. However, none of these is the main event. That would be courtesy of the gauchos who wander around the main dining area carrying skewers of meat. The salad bar was excellent. I found the veggies to be particularly good. The lobster bisque was excellent as well. However, the meat. Oh man, the meat. I actually timed how long it took before I had a full plate of meat when I flipped over the disc they give you. 25 seconds. All told, I ate 4 different kinds of meat (pork, chicken, lamb, and beef) prepared 14 different ways. The meat just keeps on coming too! And they constantly change out the plates, get new napkins, refill your water glass, whatever you need. Truly, if kings are treated better than this, I'm not sure how. It was a remarkable experience. One I plan on repeating as often as possible, ideally on someone else's dime. However, they do send out coupons. We ate half off, which made it not only affordable, but a downright steal. I honestly can't recommend this place enough.
