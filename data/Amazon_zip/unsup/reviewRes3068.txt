Chicken is amazing, as seen in other reviews. Food service is fast. The flavors are phenomenal. Only other place I have been with Korean style wings with that delicious sauce and crispiness is Great Seas in Albany Park. Only place that is comparable to Crisp that I've tried for a bit cheaper. I will def be back to try the midweek whole bird deal. That seems legit.
