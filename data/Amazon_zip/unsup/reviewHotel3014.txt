So we "took the long way home" after an epic business trip. That's code for making up a reason to go somewhere cool to just drink. We drove from Kalamazoo, arrived around 8, had a drink in the lobby and proceeded to hit as many bars and restaurants we could find before crashing at around 2. We were up by 8 to make a flight. So, if you do the math, we spend about 7 hours at this W. That said, yeah, I'm totally a fan. This is the kind of place that is thinking about how to make an impression even if you don't notice. Well, I noticed - probably because that's my job. An example: taking the elevator after check-in, I noticed the rugs said "good evening". Through the fog of the previous night, the next morning I noticed they said "good morning". Possibly kitchy but the W can totally pull that kind of stuff off. So, I didn't spend enough time there to weigh in on the food or much of the service but from a pure "great place to crash" perspective, yeah - I'm totally a fan.
