Not a big fan. We got it for a decent rate on New Year's Eve ($179), but in comparison to some of the other deals we could have got, it doesn't seem like that great of a deal. (Hindsight is 20/20.) We obviously were paying more for the location than anything else. It's clean and in a great location. However, my biggest beef lies in their customer service. We checked in around 3pm with another couple, and got our keys. I then heard the other clerk asking my friends if they minded a full size bed, which they of course did. When I checked with the clerk who had already checked us in, I discovered that the room also contained a full size bed. Since I had paid for a queen size on http://hotels.com, I was miffed that they tried to sneak a full size bed on us. And who has full sized beds anymore? We were told that we'd have to wait till around 5pm, along with many other people, to get a room with a queen sized bed because they were "fully committed". I'm normally very easy going, but come on - it's New years eve and we've got plans. So now instead of getting to workout and nap before our dinner resos, we're hurrying. The rooms are tiny and the doors are thin. We got back around 3am, and our next door neighbors kept throwing things at our door all night.  All in all, I'd only stay here again if I got a great rate, as you can find better deals at better hotels in the area.
