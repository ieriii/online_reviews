Top scores on food, service and value. That alone would earn them 5 stars in my book, but there's more. Anthony Bourdain would love this place. The menu offers things you don't find very often - peasant dishes like pigs tails, pig's ear with kale, sardines with shaved fennel, tripe, bacon fat pork belly confit, and the very popular roasted bone marrow. Don't be afraid, there are many items that even the most conventional would enjoy. Another favorite of Bourdain's would certainly be the kitchen. It's all right in front of you. I watched in admiration as the crew (hispanic, as Bourdain points out, are always behind the scenes of the best restaurant) hustled non stop and showed great care in preparation and presentation. It made me glad to see often they tasted what they were preparing (not to worry, they practiced impeccable kitchen hygiene). Very fun to watch. The wine and cheese menus, like everything else, were excellent but limited (in a good way) to fit the cuisine. And, if all that wasn't enough, the desserts are an experience unto themselves. This place is really small, which IMHO is what makes this place so special. No factory kitchen. No encyclopedia-type menus to slug through (one-page with everything on it). And, no banquet hall style dining room.
