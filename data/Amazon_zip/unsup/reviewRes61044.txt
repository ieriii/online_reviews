Wishbone is fantastic!I have been going there for years and have never been disappointed. Their foods range from classic breakfast (pancakes, eggs, etc) to southern (grits and cornbread)! It is so delicious. It is one of the few breakfast places in town with good pricing. Sometimes it can get crowded, because its just that good! Service is great. The place has interesting decoration and is great for families. Go to Wishbone!
