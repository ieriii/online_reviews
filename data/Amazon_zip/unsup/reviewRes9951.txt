Well, I liked it. I thought it was going to be a piccolo and woodwind intrument themed restaurant. Instead, it was general italian food. We ordered the anti-pasto platter to begin with. Again, I am not sure why people are so against Pasto? People are really against things these days. Wall Street, Khadafi, Leprosy. What is up with that? We have a tough attitude in these times. Oh- the anti pasto was pretty good. Good Proscutio. (pronounced pro-shoot for some reason) I had a chicken pannini for lunch. It was ok. Nothing special. We had several glass goblets of wine at our lunch, which made coming back to work challenging. I may fall aslealvgn opgrmqgh3gh3gjgjq3g.... Sorry- passed out. I'm back now. They told me that the gelato was imported from Mt. Etna itself. It was good, so I have no reason to doubt that. My advice to this place would be to have the hostesses only play the piccolo, and when you ask them questions, or try to get on the waiting list, they communicate only by using their piccolo. Cool?
