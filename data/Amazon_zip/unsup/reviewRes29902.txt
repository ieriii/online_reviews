This place is vegetarian??? You can barely tell. My greasy spoon favorite chicken fried steak tasted like the real deal. The mash potatoes topped with vegan gravy tasted like my mom's turkey drippings gravy. Speedy service with a smile. Next time I go I will be getting the vegan Reuben sandwich. I want to eat healthy all the time but lets face I love the taste of fast food. The way conventional meat is being raised. I'm really scared of where my meat came from. This is an easy place to eat a meatless meal. Great job Chicago Diner.
