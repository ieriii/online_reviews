First off, I'm new to the big city and being a resident of Bridgeport makes me that much more of a newbie to the north side, save the occasional drunken stupor around Wrigglyville. That said, after visiting the awesome guys up at Half Acre Brewery (excellent), we "hopped" across the street to The Bad Apple. We chose to dine and drink at the bar to be close to the taps and more importantly the beer. Important the beer is at this place. The burgers are tasty and filling, but nothing revelatory. I had the slow burn burger, which was good, but as a serious spice freak I was expecting a little more oomph from the hot peppers, no teary eyes or fuming from the ears with this one. My brother had the Texan Burger (or something to that effect) with pulled pork and onions rings which I tasted. This is the burger I would get the next time I visit. Though the true star of the food options here is the cheese curds. No pre-packaged or frozen curds that you find on your plate 90% of the time. Service was quick and friendly. The customers all seemed to be in good spirits, although this could probably be said for anywhere in the city on Friday at 5pm. The other gems at the Bad Apple are obvious. A great selection of beer. Unfortunately, I only had time to stay for one with my meal. There are many great foreign and domestic craft brews that will surely tempt me to come back. In fact, an order of cheese curds and a few cold ones sounds damn good right now.
