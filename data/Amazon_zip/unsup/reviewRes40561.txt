Wow! I must have had a real chip on my shoulder when I went here the first time! I completely recant my first review of this place! The Longman & Eagle has been very good to me over the summer and into the fall. I might have gotten hung up on their early claim of being a 19th Century English Inn. It kind of misses the mark on that, but it is certainly something special. This bar is an excellent little low key pub with a comfortable feeling for conversation and a meal, not to mention a huge whiskey selection! It is not prohibitedly expensive either. The Wild Bore Sandwich is in a league of its own! Word of warning: Vegetarians may not have much to choose from, but they are getting better. Congrats, Longman. You've given the Logan Square Fancy Man a watering hole. Welcome to the neighborhood!
