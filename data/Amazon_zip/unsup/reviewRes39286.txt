With a motto like "EAT - DRINK - WHISKEY," I didn't need to actually taste anything to be sold. I was staying in The Loop, so Logan Square was a bit of a trek, but it was one well worth it. The evening was perfect for sitting outside, and we were lucky to score a table as they don't take reservations. We started our meal with some craft cocktails. For you whiskey lovers, they have an impressive collection of 148 selections. You can also appreciate their other unique offerings, which include unusual spirits and biodynamic, small batch wines. While the guy sitting next to me was enjoying a juicy bacon cheeseburger with a side of beef fat fries (be still my clogged heart) tempted me to order the same, the two of us petite girls decided to order 3 dishes to share: chanterelle agnolotti, pork belly confit and slow roasted cauliflower. We attempted to order a side of beef fat fries, but sadly, they cannot do sides of it. I was sort of crushed by that. Luckily, all 3 dishes were amazing, so it made up for the lack of beef fat fries. If you're a vegetarian, I'd highly recommend the cauliflower, as it is an entree portion. There's a uber hipster vibe going on here - you can even book a room upstairs in their Ace Hotel-like digs. I also loved that they left us with a postcard that showed that they don't take themselves too seriously. Now, which yelper actually called bone marrow & wild boar "YUCKY" - blasphemous!
