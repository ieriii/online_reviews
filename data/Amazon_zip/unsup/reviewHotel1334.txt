my church just had their benefit at the Ritz and i have to say - the Ritz staff was fantastic. never had my wineglass been refilled so quickly nor so discreetly. they handled late arrivals with calmness and alacrity; they navigated narrow spaces without a single spill and they switched out courses with a minimum of fuss and noise. (hear that, hilton?? minimum of fuss and noise!) the dinner last night was really good; they had a potato gratin 'cake' that was so yummy, the folks at my table wanted to call for more. the meal, and wine selection, was well above the standard rubbery chicken/steamed vegetable fare at other hotels in the city. (hear that, hilton?) i've also been here for the annual planned parenthood gala and it's a similar story - great staff, wonderful menu, nice wine and just really good event planning. Ritz events really flow and their staff make an effort to make sure visitors have nothing to worry about.
