What a nice place! I came here on a date, and it definitely made me like the guy a little more. Just kidding. Kind of. I had a couple of sazeracs to start - it's a whiskey or cognac cocktail that's positively delicious. My date tried a dark and stormy, but deemed it too sweet and switched to beer. We split everything, and it was all fantastic. We had the bone marrow, which was amazing and a HUGE portion. I probably could have dined on that alone. We also had the gnocchi, which was fantastic and rich, and we had the mussels. We had the brownie with ice cream for dessert, but it was lacking. Nothing special there. Overall - great date and a great restaurant. Definitely recommend.
