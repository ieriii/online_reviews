For a place that has such wonderful people working there, and for their delightfully elegant looking treats. Flavor and texture don't nearly meet the desire to pay $7 for a pastry again. The Lola is dry, flavorless, and the chocolate is probably carob. Cookies aren't moist or sweet-at all! The coffee is so bitter I went to Starbucks. The French Macaroons are delicious, and I've heard good things about the cake. And if you care about your dog, don't take the free biscuits. Me thinks not!
