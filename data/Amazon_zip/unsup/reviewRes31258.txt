I had the day off, and decided to arrange lunch with an old friend who works for the POHleece (35th and MIchigan). He usually eats at his desk, so didn't have a clue as to where to go. After some discussion, we northsiders timidly ventured into the wilds of Bridgeport. I imagined some sort of dank bar, where we would eat Italian beef sandwiches, washed down with mediocre beer. Not that there's anything wrong with that. Instead, we stumbled upon this wonderful little organic cafe. Since we were already in mental meat mode, my friend had a mushroom burger and I ordered the BLT. Both were delicious; I also loved my side of wheat-berry salad. Nana is great addition to the neighborhood.
