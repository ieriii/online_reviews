I know that yelpers have declared shenanigans over Graham's public dislike of yelp. Graham, believe me, I'm right there with you. But despite being sympathetic to that viewpoint, I still need to tell it how it is. I came into Graham Elliot with high expectations. Thought I'd be sampling a new, fresh voice on the Chicago scene, giving me interesting food in a cool environment. This dude has made himself famous somehow - I've never been to Avenues, but I saw him on Top Chef and he seemed like he knew what he was doing. Unfortunately, nothing really came together. The Foie-lly pops were OK, if you're into that sort of thing, but neither of our entrees were really that spectacular. I had the lamb, my wife had the halibut. Both were average, nothing terribly exciting. And were priced into the high $20s. The Mexican chocolate cake with the horchata milkshake for dessert was really tasty, though... but really didn't make up for the average entrees. Unfortunately, Graham Elliot seems to be a lot of style, and not a lot of substance. The menu certainly is creative, but something just isn't working right.
