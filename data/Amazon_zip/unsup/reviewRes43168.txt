Art of Pizza has the best deep dish in Chicago, no doubt. The crust is flaky and near perfect (maybe just a touch bready around the edges). Their sauce is the best - chunky and flavorful. Our favorite is the ham and mushroom. I prefer thin crust pizza overall, but this is where I go for deep dish every time.
