We sat in the oyster bar and enjoyed 2 dozen oysters, 2 lbs of alaskan king crab legs, crab spring rolls, and wine paired by suggestions from our waiter raphael. He was spot on with every recommendation! We will be back and request him allowing him to order for us. By far freshest oysters and meatiest king crab we have had in years. If you like seafood this should be your first choice, the price is appropriate for the quality!
