Tru is one of those restaurants that goes beyond just being a place to grab some dinner. You truly DINE at Tru. Granted, it is way too expensive a place to frequent, at least for us, but if you can stand facing the check at the end of the night, it is quite an experience. We went on our anniversary and they printed our names on the menu, which was kind of cool. It's such an easy thing to do and makes the clientele feel special - very clever. We had cocktails to start and mine was a martini involving Hendrick's gin and saki and it was delicious and beautifully presented. When they brought the napkins, there was a choice of white or black, so you wouldn't get contrasting lint on your clothes, which was unnecessary for us, but a nice touch that just reminds you what a classy place you are in and is also perhaps another attempt to justify the price. I suppose it doesn't hurt. The food was amazing and my wagyu beef short rib was maybe the best piece of meat I have ever eaten in my entire life. So often, it is disappointing, after all the fuss and high prices and the food is good, even very good, but not great. The short rib there is great. I had to take off a star, though, after the waiter hesitated to bring me a Grand Marnier instead of whatever the cake or tort was that was included in our prix fixe menu. He actually said it might be a dollar or two difference in price. Here, we are spending that kind of money and he is going to be a stickler for $2. That was weak, especially after they go to the trouble to see to all the other little details and everything. They also wrote a personalized "Happy Anniversary" message on the glass plate the dessert was served on, which was a nice touch. It's crazy expensive, but if you are going to go out and spend $400 - $500+ on dinner somewhere in Chicago (that's with one of the more reasonably priced bottles of wine), I recommend it.
