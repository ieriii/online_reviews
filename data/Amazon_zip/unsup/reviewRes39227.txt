If I had a conversation with God, this is how I imagine it would play out. Me: "Hi God. What's up?' God: "Oh, not much. Just trying to keep the human race from imploding." Me: "Oh, that's all? Well, could you squeeze in one little favor for me.' God: "Of course my child." Me: "You already know I'm a fan of meat. Could you create a cuisine that combines the best seasoning and the most tender meat one person can consume." God: "Why Lori, this already exists. Its called Korean BBQ. Head north my child, to a restaurant called San Soo Gab San, and you shall be rewarded." And rewarded I was! Holy Moses is this place amazing. This is not for the faint of heart. Platters with mounds and mounds of raw meat are brought to your table and then you grill the food yourself.  Choose from one of the numerous extras (potatoes, fish cakes, seaweed, etc), add white rice, a piece of meat, and roll it in a cabbage leaf.  If this is what heaven is like, then I'm a believer.
