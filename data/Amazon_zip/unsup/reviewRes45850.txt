The Grand Lux Cafe is a great place to go to eat. They have so many options that you are sure to find something you will like here. Heck their slogan is "Something for Everyone." It does kind of remind me of a Chicago version of the Cheesecake Factory (But better). Some of my favorite dishes that I would highly recommend are:   - Mediterranean Mahi Mahi   - Shaking Beef   - Any version of The Chop House Burger You can't go to the Grand Lux without having one of their dessert. Remember to order it before your meal because they do take about 30 minutes to prepare. My favorite is the Molten Chocolate Cake served with vanilla ice cream.
