For some reason, I have been going here a lot in the last few months. I heard that their Pad Thai is the best in the city and so I gave it a try. I tried their peanut sauce spring rolls (I basically would put peanut sauce on anything) and it was good. I got the Pad Thai and it was quite delicious. It is definitely better than other ones that I have tried in the city and thankfully missing that weird orange color that other ones seem to have. (phew!) I dont know if it is the best Pad Thai ever but it was definitely pretty good. They are BYO and are usually easy to get a seat (I think that they have reservations for larger groups, but not for a group of two or four)  I am not sure about their heat scale-sometimes it seems spicy and other times, it is not spicy at all I have tried other noodles dishes (I cant remember which, but maybe #53?) and they were all pretty good. The service is FAST. We had a cranky waitress over the weekend but I am sure that there were a lot of drunkies coming from May fest and that probably got really annoying, really fast, so I won't hold it against her, she was just trying to do her job. I'll most likely be back soon!
