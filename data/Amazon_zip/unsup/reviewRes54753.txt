I love Meli's and come here all the time during the week. I tried to go for weekend brunch once and the wait was so insane that I left--definitely easier getting a table during the week if you work nearby. The food is really fresh, fantastic quality (a lot of the produce is organic) and there is so much variety that there is something for everyone. i LOVE the potatoes that come with the egg dishes which is some sort of diced/smashed baby reds sauteed with onions: AWESOME! the house-made marmalades that they serve with toast are soooo good and always changing, and the fresh squeezed juices are delicious! i like that you can be healthy here and have an egg white omlette filled with veggies, or you can pig out on a monte cristo with fantastic french fries. Speaking of pigging out, I've heard great things about the stuffed french toast: 2 pieces of challah filled with mascarpone and dipped in vanilla bean custard. I've never been so brave, but no one lives forever and what a happy way to go!I think the service is pretty great considering this is in Greek town, and, according to a friend of mine from Carpathos, Greek restaurants aren't exactly known for their hospitable service. You get seated quickly, they take your order fast, and bring your food fast. Sometimes they forget about your check, but I think they're just letting you stay as long as you want without pushing you out the door. Seems like good service to me!
