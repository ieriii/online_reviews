This place was fantastic! I ordered the honey jalapeno pork chop and loved every bite of it! It was not spicy at all, more of a sweet sauce. And the sweet potatoes underneath were delicious as well. The other people I was with got the roasted duck and the skirt steak with sauteed veggies and rice and enjoyed their meals just as much! We will definitely be back for more.
