Dogsitting for the weekend in sweltering Chicago meant I would need to cool down with a beer. I'm proud to say that I picked the Hopleaf Bar from among the smattering of "beer bars" in Edgewater and Andersonville. Great atmosphere in the bar was topped by its awesome beer selection. As my cool down beer turned into several, my pal and I kept on ordering because the selection was varied, exciting, and well priced. We were both introduced to several fresh beers and didn't even touch the bottle list. These people know good beer and serve it properly, glassware, temperatures, and portions were all well received. I didn't try their food this time will update asap. In retrospect I was happy with my experience at Hopleaf (and I'm not denying the fact that I was quite jolly as I left). I can't wait to dog-sit again and take a nice long break!
