Very much between a 3-4 star As some have said prior its JUST like a Cheesecake factory. I had the appetizer sampler for 30- and enjoyed it as alunch between me and my friend It had spinach dip and all sorts of wraps ,the buffalo one was the best overall tasty I forgot where I was asking for sweet tea and ordered a glass of wine instead! good service , I personally do not describe a place like this nor cheesecake factory posh.
