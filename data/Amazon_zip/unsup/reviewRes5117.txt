Taste: 4 Value: 4 Service: 4 I had passed by the Purple Pig a couple of times and really wanted to try it out. The unique name and hidden nature of the restaurant added intrigue that necessitated investigation. I will say that when the place is busy, it's hectic. Though small, they pack a lot of people in there by using shared tables. This is where confusion happens. I was mis-seated twice before I was finally given a place and served. I had the Pig's Ear with Crispy Kale, Pickled Cherry Peppers & Fried Egg, and the Octopus with Green Beans, Fingerling Potatoes & Salsa Verde. I was surprised by how much breading there was on the pig ears. I grew up eating pig and cow ears, so I was looking forward to the taste and texture of years past. I was disappointed to loose the texture in batter and only have a faint pork taste. The composition of the dish was great. The different elements complemented each other well. I wish they focused more on making the pig ears the star of the show. The octopus was a sour surprise that was quite pleasing. The sourness is similar to capers, but you could taste how fresh the salsa verde was. The octopus was cooked well. Not too chewy, with a sear on one side. The fingerling potatoes were a disappointment though. It was cut like french fries and lost it's character. The wine was a great recommendation by my waiter, Andrew. He knew his wines and did a great job of pairing my meal. I hear the cheeses are top notch here. I didn't partake because those are things I enjoy with friends in small quantities. I hear the Blu di Bufala is one of the better choices. They also had a bone marrow spread. Gotta try those next time I come by with my friends.
