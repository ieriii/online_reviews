It starts with the salad bar, which also has a selection of smoked fish and meats. Then it continues with a continuous parade of excellent beef, lamb, and chicken served to you directly by the guys who grilled it. They can serve you any temperature you like and it's all delicious. Stuff wrapped in bacon, filet mignon, it's all there. I love it. Great meat-friendly wine list too. All this place needs is to put a vegetarian on the menu--I hear those anti-meat people taste delicious.
