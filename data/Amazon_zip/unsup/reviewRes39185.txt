I have currently been here 10 times since February. Once , I went I could not stop myself from going back time and time again. I mean what is not to love then the aroma of yummy bbq floating around in the air ? The various yummy pan chan dishes and drinking suju with you buddies. Its just simple heaven. Its like I became a god and instead of being fed grapes I have being hand fed various delishes types of Korean food. Everything from Bollusm dish which I think can be compared to mexican carnitas. With its yummy radish kimchi and soak salted cabbage leaves for wrapping. The yummy seafood stew with various types of sea food and big pieces of crab in it. This place is just the the best I never knew the wonderful bounties that korean food offered before I came here. My eyes have been open and I am loving every second of it!! And so is my belly!!!
