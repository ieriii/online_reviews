I'm a vegetarian so of course I was not the best judge of a place such as this, however, what I did have, the veggie dog and the fries were great! My husband who is not a vegetarian had the hot dogs and said they were terrific as well. 5 star rating, not sure about that but for sure a 4 star. It was really cold the day we came and we got in line right when they opened and waited about 25-30 min which we were told was SUPER FAST. CASH ONLY so beware, you probably want to bring at least $15/pp.  I have to say that we got the duck fat fries and the regular and could not taste the big difference. Fries are HUGE so even if you're super SUPER hungry, you can share an order. VERY FRIENDLY STAFF!!! If you're a hot dog lover, you can't miss this place, def. must try it out.
