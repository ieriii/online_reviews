Great Cuban Sandwich!!! 10 dollar lunch worth paying for. Drink, Sandwich, and Side. Great Service, nice clean sitting area (stools only). Do yourself a favor and skip Kuma's for once and check this place out when your in the neighborhood. The Fries were great. the Sandwiches were fantastic. Well done! Keep these people in business!
