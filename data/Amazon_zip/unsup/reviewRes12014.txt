Meh. I've experienced better is exactly how I would put it. Not sure what all the fuss is. I've lived in the Uk. Village area for about 3 or 4 years now and I sure as hell have experienced A LOT better - especially when considering the wait and the price. Why anyone would wait in a 45+ min. line on a Sun. or Sat. morning is beyond me (note: my wait was probably just about as long until I chose the bar seating, but still I'll never do it again). What all these people are lining up for also boggles my rattled mind. I mean, don't get me wrong - you got some guests from out of town and you want to show them the hopping brunch scene in the new and cool bucktown neighborhood. If these guests are good enough company where conversation comes easy, you don't mind dropping a few dimes on brunch, standing shoulder-to-shoulder with strangers, and creepily drooling over people's food through the window, Bongo Room is your place. However, my questions lies here: why go somewhere that takes as long to get in as it does to eat and pay at other restaurants? Not to mention, the place doesn't even serve over-the-top mouth-watering food? Maybe I was too hungover for the crowd and not in a good mood. Maybe I hated the hashbrowns and am too picky. All I'm saying is don't waste your morning hour waiting for someone to call out your named so that you can experience okay service and mediocre food among the masses and masses and masses......
