I am maybe the last person to get here in the city of Chicago, but my first experience was great. You all know by know what makes the violet hour special -- good classic drinks, quality ingredients, "speakeasy" atmosphere. Really that is what it is, nothing blew me away, the drinks were very good, music not too loud and I had a great time with two new friends. However, unless I am in the area or entertaining someone, not sure if I'll go back on my own -- the place is unique and somewhere everyone should go once to talk about it with their friends.
