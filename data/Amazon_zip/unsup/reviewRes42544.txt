Yes, Ive indeed tried a lot of pizza. Ive had pizza in Chicago, New York, DC, Boston and I have eaten pizza, in Italy, right in front of the flipping coliseum. Does that make me an expert? YES. So heres the news and listen up: Art of Pizza is greater than Pequads Art of Pizza is greater than Pizanos Art of Pizza is greater than Uno Art of Pizza is greater than Giordanos Art of Pizza is greater than Ginos Art of Pizza is greater than Leonas That being said, I am a huge fan of Lou's and thus I wouldnt quite give Art the edge there, but Lou's is one of those things you either worship it or dont. Art does NOT use the "buttercrust" so if youre looking to go that route, try Lou's. Go here. Order a stuffed for sure. You will see the Gods.
