Well the drinks/bartenders saved this from being a two star, on second thought no they didn't. They missed our reservation by 45 minutes. However, the drinks were very good. The oysters were alright, the clams were very fishy, and the crab legs we both ordered were not great, I don't know how to describe it but if you've had enough king crab you know when you're not having good crab.
