I have to say I was disappointed at the "salad bar," minimal at best and terrible selection. The meat on the other hand was EXCELLENT! I have never been to Fogo de Cho (sp), but my now "former" boyfriend and I loved this place. The service and the atmosphere if fun and inviting. For the price, I think it's worth it. I have been back twice since my first visit.
