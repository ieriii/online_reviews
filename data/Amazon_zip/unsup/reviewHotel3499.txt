Held our wedding here in November 2010 and could not have been happier. Our coordinator, Julia, went above and beyond to make sure that everything went as perfectly as planned. Fernando was fantastic too at making sure everything went smoothly. Yes, the standard rooms are small so be prepared, but the suites are really nice.  The ballroom on the 23rd floor (Tip Top Tap) is fantastic. Incredible view of Michigan Ave., which was perfect for all our out of town guests. We had about 120 people, which was just about a perfect size. The food was great as well. We had so many compliments on the whole evening from all of our guests. I would not have done anything differently.
