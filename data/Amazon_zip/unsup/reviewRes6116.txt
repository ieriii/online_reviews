Wow! This place is so unexpected on Taylor St! Came here on a Sunday night, was promptly seated. This space is so cute and cozy yet hip in its own way. I'm excited to return back for more. First, I HIGHLY recommend the polenta + ragu. Creamy and satisfying...unlike any other polenta you've had! Crispy pork belly with apple mustard sauce (sweet with a kick) is also a steal--two huge pieces of fat, skin super crispy and savory as promised. The corn salad is also a must because the wild mushrooms really make it a winner. We almost didn't get this because I didn't want any salad but so glad my friend insisted...otherwise I would've totally missed out! We weren't as crazy about the pastas. The lobster/sea urchin linguini dish was quite good. You can tell the linguini was very fresh but they were a little skimp on the urchin. We just weren't blown away. The risotta felt undercooked and bland. The pizzas all around us looked pretty fabulous. Like i said, can't wait to try more!
