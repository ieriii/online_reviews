The Purple Pig is fun. Be prepared to wait, an hour or so - and to shout. Its very loud. Its a nice room with lots of shared tables and an odd amalgam of decor. The outdoor are should be terrific when Spring arrives. Food? This is a "small plates!" restaurant, so there is a lot of ordering involved. And little dishes/bowls of bits and bites of this and that. I guess that the serving style kinda jives with the decor - a bit schizo but pleasant. We wound up having a mashup of appetizer sized bites: fried brussels sprouts, beets/goat cheese, milk braised pork, etc... and a turkey leg. The Pig related menu items - ears, tail, feet - just really didn't make a hit. Same for the bone marrow. One in our party noted that the place is almost entirely filled with women. There may be a connection between the small plates! and the desire from guys to want more than say...a tablespoon of fried brussels sprouts flakes from a little bowl passed around the table. Don't get me wrong here, the brussels sprouts flakes were terrific. Actually quite terrific. The beer selections are very good, the wine list extensive... but wine at $10 a glass comes in at the "barely passable" level and doesn't get to "nice" until $16. You can extrapolate those figures to bottle pricing. Overall, price/value is pretty even here. My party ate a fair amount, drank a fair amount, and paid around $60 per person. We enjoyed some interesting bites and overall had a great time. After drinks elsewhere following the meal, we all did eat again as everyone was still feeling a bit unfulfilled in the hunger department. So, as is the guideline with any place offering small plates! (exclamation included), realize that a large portion of the experience will be social. In this area, the Purple Pig does deliver strongly as an enjoyable spot to be with those you enjoy most... with the bonus of some interesting tastes to graze and make you happy. I will go again, hopefully to enjoy that great looking patio !
