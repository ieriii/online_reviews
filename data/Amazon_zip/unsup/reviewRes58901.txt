Ok so after 2 years of not wanting to like you, i gave you a shot. dined here the other day for my birthday dinner (my first time but many others in party had been) with 11 others in our party. We were seated right away- 12 ppl for a reservation at 8:30 on a sat- i was shocked! our waiter was great, even in a place with so many people and it being so loud, she was really patient and attentive the entire evening. since we had a large group we were able to try many dishes. a few standouts were the rockshrimp, tale of two tunas, crispy rice with tuna, no you didnt handroll... we tried a bunch of other things but those i remember well. I also drank about 3 or 4 of peared sakes---- they were amazing. would have thought they were kool aid the way i took them down. overall everyone in our party was very happy with out dinner and would dine there again in the future. Oh and i forgot to mention the ridiculous for dessert- i know my desserts and that was one of the best!! not quite sure what it was but it was ridiculous!
