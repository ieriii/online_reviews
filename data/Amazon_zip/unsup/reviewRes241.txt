This is a totally different dining experience than I have ever had, anywhere else, ever. A destination in and of itself. The food was wonderfully executed, the wine pairings were fabulous, the service was great (and not overly formal; one gets the sense that the wait staff is trained to read their diners individually--if you want want formality, I'm sure they could do it, but if you want to be more relaxed, joke around, be a little chatty--they can do that too. This sort of adaptability is hard to accomplish, but for me, the hallmark of truly exceptional service). Alinea was good enough that the cliche "in a class by itself" doesn't seem cliche. I couldn't do it all the time--who would want to do it all the time?--but I'm glad I was lucky enough to go at least once. By the way, make sure you schedule some time. We started at 8:30, and left the restaurant at 1:30 am!
