I've been to Sapori Trattoria about a dozen times and have never been disappointed. In fact, I think it's incredibly underrated and often unknown to friends or townies who are looking for a place to eat.  There are two dining areas, one in the front of the restaurant where the bar is, and one larger room in back. Try to get a table in front near the window, especially if you are on a date. In the summer there is a very large area for tables on the side of the restaurant. The wine list has plenty of reasonable bottles, the pasta is homemade, and the desserts fantastic. The decor is also very cool - think loft style, dark, and candle-lit.  I'm not sure why this place doesn't get more love, perhaps because of its location on a fairly busy corner near Diversey/Halsted but I would encourage anyone who has their parents in or just wants to enjoy a cozy long dinner to forego the bigger name places in the city and go here instead. Your dinner-mates will love you forever. I've been to plenty of Italian restaurants in the city and Sapori is among the best.
