I still heart this place. The meat is tantalizing and amazing. Although it's all really succulent and well marinated, I found the ribs are the most flavorful quickly followed by the beef and then the chicken. New found love for their miso soup. It comes with huge chunks of tofu, and cucumbers! They lost a star because the service was bad and it took over 15 min for us to get more lettuce. Although in tradition you must flag down a server at Korean BBQ, this was beyond the acceptable flag down time.
