Ok....so the pizzas are huge, make sure you order appropriately. Their 1-2 people will feed two people easily, even if they have large appetites. The pizza itself...well it's good. Very cheesy, nice enough sauce. Didn't love the crust though - a bit too pastry-like. I have had better stuffed pizza other times I have been to Chicago, but this was very good and I definable enjoyed it, so would be a fine introduction to the genre if you are close by. Go good, not great. As others have noted, the stuffed pizzas take 30 mins or so to cook, and a long time to eat as well so not fast food!
