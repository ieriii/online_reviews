Wonderful buffet! I normally don't like buffets because I find the food pretty generic and low quality. Also, can't really eat enough at once to make a buffet a good deal. But we used the groupon for the lunch buffet and it was probably the best I've tried. The butter chicken was delicious. All white meat (no mystery bits) as you usually find in gravy/sauced meats. Great seasoning and flavors in everything. The chick peas were outstanding...just the right amount of spice. They brought out a special sizzling chicken dish with naan and it was really tasty and fresh. I think the buffet is around $15/pp It's well worth it. The decor is cute & authentic. Service is perfect. OH!! the desserts are also fantastic. The mango ice cream and Gulab jamun, in particular. This place has made me a fan of Indian food.
