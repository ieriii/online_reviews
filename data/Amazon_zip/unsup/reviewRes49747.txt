This place is far more charming than I expected. The food is delicious, the space is intimate and warm, and the staff super friendly. Why three stars? We were with a group of 10 for a friend's birthday. My friend had a bit of a hassle getting a reservation, and they made her put down a deposit for a reservation? What... knock of a star... Why knock off the other star? An $8 corkage fee. Really? With 10 people, and 8 bottles of wine, it's a little over the top. I know that's how these places pay for their license etc. But $8 per bottle. Nope. Those two points being made. Everyone at the table absolutely loved the food. The empanadas were absolutely delicious, rare steak cooked beautiful pink, calamari and octopus grilled delicate (NOT TOUGH). The appetizers... delicious! I really really do want to give this place more than 3 stars, but there are just a few initial quirks that bothered me off the bat, and some of the appetizers seemed a touch on the pricier side. I'd definitely go back, but maybe with a smaller group, and hopefully be more objective.
