Just can't get into it. The food, in my opinion, is simply boring. I yearn for flavor, texture and other things that go "pop". After years of trying to find something that stands out on the menu, I am ready to give up. There are so many other amazing vegetarian/vegan restaurants in the city. Come here once to say you've been here and then move on... Of course, I rate them as "A-OK" because any spot that supports animal welfare is A-OK in my book.
