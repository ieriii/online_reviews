This place is casual but alive with energy. Its menu is extensive and they are known for their quality junkfood and extensive burger menu. Vegetarians don't fret, they have a veggie burger option. They also have a quality bar that has a life of its own late at night. I recommend the cheese curds if you are looking for a great late night snack. Note that their bugers are HUGE, albeit delicious. Note the hilarious signs on the wall and on the bathroom door, they really give the place humor and personality. I will certainly be back to the fifty/50.
