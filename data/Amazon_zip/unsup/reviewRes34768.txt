On my trip to Wicker Park, I decided to find a vegetarian place to have lunch. It's was a toss up between Sultan's Market and Handlebar, so I decided to try Sultan's Market because I enjoy middle eastern food. I decided to order the No. 22 Vegetarian Combo $6 (Hummus, Tabuli, 2 pcs falafel, pita) and an extra serving of Babaganoush $0.75. According to the menu, you got a choice of rice (curry or lentil) and salad (tabuli or Jerusalem) with all dinner combos, so I chose the lentil rice and Jerusalem salad. The servers were really nice and helpful with my order. However, when I got to the "CASH ONLY" register and the cashier tried to charge me extra ($4) for the Jerusalem salad. He said the tabuli is the salad. I told him that while it was true that a tabuli is a salad, it was listed as part of the combo and not the choice of sides, which came with all of the dinners. When I refused to pay extra for the salad, he started calling me cheap and acted outright hostile. I stood firm and did not end up paying, but I thought that it was deceptive advertising and poor customer service. I told him that it's not the best idea to be so rude to your customers and he said that he doesn't want customers like me. I was offended but hungry so I sat down and ate my food which was mediocre at best. I would advise any customer visiting to be on alert for deceptive charges. The prices were affordable but don't expect good customer service from the cashier, who was somewhat reminiscent of a notorious Seinfeld character who sold soup. I will not be returning in the future, but instead will be trying out another vegetarian friendly location, perhaps Handlebar.
