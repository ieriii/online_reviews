I feel like I should preface this with the fact that I'm not veggie or vegan. But I needed to take a vegan friend out for a meal and he suggested this place. I am more than a little resistant to the idea of meat substitutes (Seitan specifically is pretty intensely not my thing). So, ready to be totally open to new things, I was excited to have this meal, and I was not disappointed.  Ok, I wussed out on the meat substitute stuff and ordered the Black Bean Patty sandwich, it's topped with coleslaw, lettuce and tomato. It was pretty awesome. I don't even usually like coleslaw, but it was vinegary and wonderful. The one thing lacking in the bun, it wasn't bad but it also just wasn't strong enough to hold my sandwich. It got me pretty messy and I had to revert to a knife and fork. I also had the side salad, it was a salad. Now the part of the meal that you should hear about is the dessert. We shared a piece of chocolate chip cheese cake that was awesome. Not like as good as my aunt's with the graham cracker crust that's basically butter and sugar, but really good. Like even if you don't want to have a whole veggie/vegan meal, stop in for dessert. For real. Do it.
