This place is only OK. There menu during the week is limited, nothing special. The weekend menu includes a few more items and their pancakes that all come with some slightly different take on the same base sauce, lame. The real place to get a good brunch is Toast. Bongo Room is for silly people that have not had anything better. I feel that people come here for the atmosphere and maybe because they are too scared to try new things. There are a dozen other places to go for brunch, this place is not worth the two hour wait. Coffee = Good Food = Mediocre Service = Not bad In all honesty, save your time. And if you really do want to wait and hour or two for brunch, go to a place with better food.
