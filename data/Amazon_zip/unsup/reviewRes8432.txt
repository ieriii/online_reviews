Very good, fairly authentic Naples-style pizza. I've been to Naples, and although this isn't as good (and really, what is), it's very good. I went on a Tuesday night at about 7, and there were plenty of tables. At about 7:30, the place was full, so make your reservations accordingly. Interior had high ceilings, large windows, brick red and yellow walls. It was definitely very nice inside. The owner came by and gave me and my date a sample of a pastry that had garlic, basil, scallions and anchovies in it. It wasn't my favorite dish (partly because I don't like anchovies), but the fact that he came by to give us a free appetizer was very nice. Don't expect typical wine here -- it's all Italian and served Naples-style (in glass cups rather than wine glasses). Don't worry, they explain each wine, the flavors in it, and in some cases, what its French counterpart would be. The pizza, as stated, was very good, but not knock-your-socks-off amazing. I've actually had better -- Sapore Di Napoli in Lakeview on Belmont had more buffalo mozzarella and a slightly more charred and crispy crust. I'd still, however, definitely recommend this place if you're in the area!
