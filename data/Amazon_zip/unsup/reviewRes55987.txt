4.5 Stars!! Gastropub that generally fits any occasion and is somehow, mostly free of tourists (mostly). I've been here with parents for dinner, close friends, co-workers for drinks and downstairs a few times for private parties. Their brunch is phenomenal without being over-the-top. I would recommend the eggs benedict, the mussels vindaloo , fish and chips, Gage Burger and scallops as favorites!
