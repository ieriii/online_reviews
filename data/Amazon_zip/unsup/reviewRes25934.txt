I like Geja's even though you don't have a choice of broth/oil for the main fondue course. Even when it is so dark you can barely see your date let alone what you're eating. However, I am a bit perturbed by their Valentine's Day package. You MUST get the package deal to eat there on Friday or Saturday. A friend and I want to go, but we are vegetarian. Why do I have to pay exactly the same amount as people who will be getting more? Not very accommodating.
