Enough distance has passed between me and this meal (literally) where I finally feel I can review my experience. While it wouldn't be fair to say this is the end-all be-all to the great Brazillian all-you-can eat steakhouse debate, Golden Corral it is not. Put simply, Fogo de Chao is a meat parade that will cost you an arm and a leg if you're not careful. The caring staff will explain the rules (green means 'meat', red means 'stop bothering me') to you then try to up-sell you on the drinks. After the meal, you'll realize that 8oz bottles of Coca-Cola were $4. Seriously, that's where they make their money.  I started off with their small and sufficient salad bar but realized it's a half hearted attempt to make you think you're balancing out the meal. As the meal progressed the different items on the menu get shuffled around the restaurant. Operating like a well oiled machine, Fogo's plates, knives and bits of meat fly around so fast you'll have your pick of the day's menu in no time.  Along with the sides of potato, plantains, and a third side I don't recall, I probably sampled 12 out of seventeen items on the day's menu. That's partly due to the fact that the meat servers would serve one side of the table then walk away (we were a large party). I probably missed out on a few items, but that's okay. After a while you'll start to feel like you're at a carnival but this time, all the barkers come to you with their meat-toss games. At the end of the meal, you'll cry mercy and turn that card over to red. The table clears and you'll walk away in a daze...not sure what to do with yourself for the rest of the evening. It's a good meal experience, but I wouldn't make a habit out of it.
