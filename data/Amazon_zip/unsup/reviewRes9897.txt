Not sure what I can add that hasn't been said over 1500 times. I really like this place. We've been coming here since it opened and now it is one of my son's fave spots. I like the fact that have 3oz samples of the beers for $1. The samples used to come in really cute glasses, I may or may not have a few of those sample glasses at my home, the new sample glasses aren't as cute. I think white pizza is the way to go. My new favorite is a white pizza with mashed potatoes and black olives, really good. The mashed with bacon is also pretty good. It gets crowded and can be very loud, but you will have great pizza and beer.
