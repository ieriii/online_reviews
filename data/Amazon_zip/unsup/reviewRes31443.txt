I had a blueberry mimosa, and for that drink, I'd consider going back. No, I'm not ashamed to admit that I'd go back to a diner for the awesome drinks even though I dont like the food. Everyting else? Meh. Im no longer a vegan/veggie but I was for a long time, so I'm pretty familiar with good meat substitutions and the sausage patty was um... not that. I remember eating grass as a child, and for some reason, biting into that sausage patty brought back memories of those afternoons where my mouth was full of dirt. The pancakes (or maybe it was the syrup?) had a weird pumpkiny after taste (maybe a cinnamon overload?) I wasn't particularly fond of. The potatoes were good. Eggs were good. Boystown is good. I'll go to Halsted's, Roscoe's, or even IHOP next time and just order a veggie meal though... less cramped, better food.
