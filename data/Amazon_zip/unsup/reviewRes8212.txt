My apologies already. Sorry but every time I have bad reviews, I feel the need to offer my apologies as it's a tough economy already and we all are trying to survive. I have given this place SO many chances because everyone raves about it, that I always thought I was the 'wrong" one....but, after all these times, I still have the same exact opinion. This is Napoli-style pizza and it's supposed to be thin and crisp, but it is always always soggy (yes, I said it twice!). It is also pretty expensive and way too crowded (very loud too!!). What amazes me is that every time I went there with friends (not same ones) at the end, they all were disappointed & shared the same exact opinion....so, I am not alone in my disenchantment.
