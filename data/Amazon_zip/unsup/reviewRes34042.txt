This place was a great find! I consider myself a serious foodie who loves his french toast. This place has four different kinds! I ordered the Tour de France which is a sampler of three of them. I couldn't decide which was my favorite; all delicious! I really like this place. I can't wait until I go back to Chicago so I can have more!
