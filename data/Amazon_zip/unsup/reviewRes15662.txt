Oh boy. I hate to write this review but....I really wasn't impressed with this place. Maybe it was the hype or the anticipation but...mmm, just didn't care for the place. The ambiance is nice. I guess they may have made it a bit brighter in there because from the reviews I kept reading about how dark it was in there and how you can barely see...which to me sounded really cool. It's darker at Duke of Perth than it was at this place. I also didn't get the feel of this place being a speakeasy. The first thing I thought of was Alice in Wonderland when I walked in. Whimsical high back chairs and booths...yeah....Alice in Wonderland feel for sure. It also would've been great if they would have picked music from the era they were shooting for. Service was woo brutal. We got there at 6:40 and the place opened at 6pm...what the heck happened in those 40 minutes to make the chick that was serving us have such an attitude? She all but chewed out the booth next to us when they just asked if they could sit at the bar. Never cracked a smile once even though we were being more than polite to her. Such a charmer. The snacks we ordered were actually pretty good. My friend got the sammies...yummy. We ordered the crackers, spiced nuts, curry rice krispies and the duck meatballs. Yum on everything with the exception of the crackers. Drinks were really good though my Sidecar tasted more like a Whiskey Sour. I miss my Harry's Velvet Room they were the only ones that could make a decent Sidecar. The drinks though $11 definitely have some kick and it will only take about one or two for you to be flying high. I guess if you could pick this place up and put it a block away from my apartment I might go again but it wasn't worth the trip to Wicker Park.
