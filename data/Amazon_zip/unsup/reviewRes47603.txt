Not a big fan of the brazillian all you can eat thing but the food is good. Don't come here for dinner unless you are starving and looking to feast.  In the summer the roof bar is awesome. Great drinks and the space is great. It gets a little packed as the night goes on so get there early or be prepared to deal with lines and crowds.
