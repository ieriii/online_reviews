Food - amazing Service - We ordered at the counter and they were a big help with our clumsy Spanish. Decor - This place is small and if it weren't for the outdoor seating, we would have been eating at the counter along the wall as it's the only indoor option. Not great when you're meeting friends. Again - food AMAZING!
