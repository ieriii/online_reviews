Ugh, my early reviews, so short and uninspired. A recent visit to the PB begs for an update! I have been coming here for several years now, back when I could walk here (it was a long walk, but I did it many times over...I figured I could burn some of the carbs consumed on the walk home.) The pasta never disappoints. Always hot, prepared fresh, with a fantastic special. I love it. I go in waves as to what I enjoy...first it was the cappellini pomodoro (with lovely chunks of mozzarella), then I added shrimp to that (yum!), then I started going with some pesto sauce...and now I'm onto the macaroni and cheese. Simple, delicious, and carb-heaven. Cheap, quick, and oh-so-yummy, this place never disappoints. Now, if the 22 bus could start cooperating with me...
