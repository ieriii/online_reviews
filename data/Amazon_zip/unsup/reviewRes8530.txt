I really hae no idea why people like this place so much...When I go there I do not even bother to eat... The food is just salty meat and the salad bar is ok at best....I have been there four times and eaten only twice and I do not even wanna eat....I have to or else my girlfriend feels weird....I hope to never go there again...There are so many other better palces to eat try them....
