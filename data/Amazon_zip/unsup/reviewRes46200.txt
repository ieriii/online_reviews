Grand lux is like a sister to Cheesecake factory.. the interior and the menu.. but anyway been here couple of times.. similar to CF it's hard to get a table in here but once you're seated the food was ok and big serving.. The Chocolate Cupcake is here by order only and to die for! keep on coming back for that!!
