This place was awesome. We were up that way to go to Kuma's but it was packed so we ended up here. I had been meaning to go to one of these places because my mother is Romanian. The food was great, and the attentiveness of the owner was remarkable. He was over the top enthusiastic and as other reviewers wrote, his personality alone made it fun in there. I didn't tell him I was part Romanian because I thought his head might explode.The service was a bit slow as others pointed out, but they claimed they were down a waitress for the night so I'm not deducting for that. They had 2 waitresses for ~7 tables, one of them a party of 20. So I felt it was reasonable.Again, the food was great although probably not like what most people are used to. We had the Sausage Stuffed Chicken, Veal Paprikash (sp?), and the buttercream cake which was unexpectedly great.
