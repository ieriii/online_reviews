THIS PLACE ROCKS! The only reason I am giving it 4 stars is because we ate in an unconventional way due to the wait--but it was still AMAZING!! (probably will get 5 when I try it next!) I went on a saturday night with 4 other people to a place that doesn't take reservations--because of all the hype around this restaurant we should have expected it to be longer than the hour and a half anticipated. two and a half hours! we went to go wait at the wine bar next door (Beviamo) to get a drink. We found out there that you can order the food at Davanti to go and they pick it up for you! We were lucky enough to snag a table and decided to get some appetizers. We went with the eggplant spread and ricotta spread and the brushetta which is changed daily. When we went it was asparagus. All of them were unreal. The ricotta was perfect with the honey and the eggplant had great texture. The bread was fresh and the perfect amount. We liked this idea so much that we decided to ditch waiting and order the rest of our meal. We went with the truffle and mushroom pizza (I LOVEED--but some friends said it is too rich), ceasar salad (nothing special) and the pepper pasta (good but im not a pepper lover. I love sharing and I love itallian, so this was a great spot. I can't wait to come back during the week so there won't be as long of a wait. Not to mention to food cost 12 DOLLARS EACH! Mind you we didn't eat a ton of food, but absolutely enough for 5 girls going out afterward.
