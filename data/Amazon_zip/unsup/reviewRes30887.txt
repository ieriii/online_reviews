I have two memories of this place: A couple of years ago, when I visited Chicago for the first time to decide whether I would move here, I came here by myself, and wrote up my travel notes while sipping the single most delicious vegan milkshake I've ever had. The people working at the time were incredibly friendly and chatty, and so welcoming after they heard I was thinking about moving. I remember thinking I would come here all the time once I moved here. I somehow ended up not going back until a few weeks ago, but once again I loved it so much. I had a HUGE and amazing vegan caesar chicken wrap (omg) with mashed potatoes and gravy (omfg). It was so, so good. I can't wait to go back..hopefully much sooner than in another two years.
