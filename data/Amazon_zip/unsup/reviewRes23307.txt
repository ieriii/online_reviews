Great little gem in the Aville hood. I wish I would have tried this place sooner! I had the Chicago Crepe and it was amazing. I didn't add meat because it was loaded with veggies and it had lots of flavor. Icosium has crepes that are already built or you can build your own. Great touch! My friend and I also shared the raspberry Belgium chocolate crepe for dessert. It was to die for and the chocolate was amazing! This place is BOYB so grab a bottle of wine from the liquor store across the street and get yourself some crepes!
