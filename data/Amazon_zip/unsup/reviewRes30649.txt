The sushi here is very good and so are the appetizers. I really liked the Lumpia, but the Sui Mai was kind of disappointing and very salty. These Sui Mai are not authentic like what you get at dim sum. Anyway, the Sushi Rolls I would recommend: - Baked Snow Crab Handroll - Baked Seafood Dynamite - Firecracker - Rainbow Roll - Crunchy Pig, Hidden Lobster (SO GOOD) - Caterpillar Service: Great! Vanessa was our server and she was great.  I had a fun night here and I think overall it is great for groups!
