Last weekend I had a pretty decent hungover brunch here while some friends were in town. At first I was disappointed because a lot of the *tantalizing* menu items I saw on the website were missing from the IRL menu (yo Bongo, update regularly bro). Seems like a good place to go to be naughty and indulgent on a weekend AM: a bit overpriced, ridiculously sweet (choco french toast) and fatty (BLT benedict) foods, overly garnished drinks, etc. The coffee was fantastic. The food was pretty delish too. I recommend the burritos personally. I'll come back, or maybe even try the South Loop location.
