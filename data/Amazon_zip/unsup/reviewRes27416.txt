With 30 reviews already I wasn't going to add to the mix until I read something in Elaine H's post that is worth repeating. Elaine wrote... "BONUS! Hurray for GE and their sparkling water! They have their own filtration system and carbonation machine and reusable bottles- soooo much more ecologically friendly than purchased bottled water (BTW, if you want this at home, Google on 'soda club usa'- we have one and we love it!). PLUS they keep your bottle and your glasses filled, which means you get charged for ONE bottle ($5) no matter how much you drink! Finally a restaurant that doesn't price gouge on bottled water. Given that we easily drank what could have amounted to $25-$30 worth of water at another restaurant, hats off to GE for having both environmental scruples and business scruples where bottled water is concerned.  Other restaurants should follow their example." This is great and people should be aware of what Graham Elliot is doing. There is a big trend away from bottled water due to waste issues and this is a great alternative - especially given the small $5 charge to customers. As for the food, it is simply amazing, I've been twice now and each time outstanding. The drinks also deserve high praise and the lounge area is fantastic.  Overall, if you're looking for a fun, casual place to enjoy great food, this is a perfect choice.
