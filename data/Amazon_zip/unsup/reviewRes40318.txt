My sister lives in Boston and before she moved, she had eaten here a few times. And since then, she has been craving it. Over Christmas, she was in town with her husband and the three of us went there since she could not leave here with out it. I had the steak tacos. No cilantro. They were definitely tasty and I could see why she craved it,  My most recent visit was carry out for my friend and myself. Steak tacos again and a large guacamole with chips. Now the part of this place I don't like is that there are 4 locations next to or across the street from one another. I called a differeent location and was told when I picked it up that I had to go to this one. So confusing and annoying since I had to cross over Ashland. Chips were also extra which I found strange. How else were we suppose to eat the guacamole? Still cheap and tasty so I can't complain too much.
