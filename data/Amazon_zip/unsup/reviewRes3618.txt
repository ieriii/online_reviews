Wonderful and unique place. It is fast food in that there are no waiters but the quality is way above fast food. The food is a combination of Korean with some American flavor. The Korean steak sandwich was amazing. I also love the bowls they have which are basically an Asian salad (with no lettuce) The spicy chicken wings are very spicy (and I'm pretty immune when it comes to tasting spiciness, but those are very spicy)
