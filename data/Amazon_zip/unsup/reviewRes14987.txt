I completely adore this place. One of my favorite first-impressions of a bar in the world. The ambiance and music were absolutely perfect on the Sunday night that I came here, and the drinks were perfectly made. The tobacco road manhattan was unique and delicious, and the Vieux Carre was the best I've ever had. They seem to do everything right here, from their house-made bitters to the very specific ice that fits the drink it's used for.
