After one visit, I am ADDICTED!!! My boss told me about Simply It and that she wanted to use them to cater a huge meeting coming up. I NOW KNOW WHY!!! The food was out of this world, the service was outstanding, and the entire experience left me grinning from ear to ear for at least an hour after eating. (I'm not kidding!) You will leave with your stomach and wallet full because Simply It is beyond reasonable for the quality and portions of food and it's darn tasty. What more could you ask for for a family owned, authentic restaurant? Well done, Simply It!!
