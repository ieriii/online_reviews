I always feel funny writing strong reviews about Southern restaurants because I'm not from the South. I don't really know good Southern food, but, that said, I do know good food. And Big Jones is good. The ambiance is classy feeling - i.e. white table clothes - without incredibly high prices (though I can't say I've paid before. Thanks, Boyfriend). The waiters are really nice and helpful and pretty attentive. The first time there they took forever to refill my coffee, but they've redeemed themselves. Now, onto the good food. I've had a number of dishes, and honestly been hungover for a few and never felt bad afterward. These include: two eggs breakfast, shrimp & grits, and eggs new Orleans. I've only gotten coffee, but the cocktails and drinks look fancy. A friend got flavored sweet tea one time, and the flavored syrup came separately in a small glass cup inset in the carafe. Not sure, if I'm explaining well, but now there is something to look forward to when you visit. Now I'm a fan, or at least part of their email distribution, and read they have an outdoor seating area that I really want to check out some weekend morning. Perhaps when the death heat leaves Chicago I'll get an opportunity...
