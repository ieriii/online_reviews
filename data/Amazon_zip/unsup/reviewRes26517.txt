this place is off-the-hook. $1.99 sangria in the lounge on mondays is a real find. but order the chef's tasting menu and sit back and enjoy. four courses - 3 or so tapas per course. it's a little over the top, but each and every presentation is unbelievable. the braised rabit pasta with cherry sauce is just plain old naughty. just go here...now.
