Really? At this writing average of four stars. I don't get it, I really don't. Not much to say other than this tasted like Dominoes to me, I was forced to eat Dominoes Pizza or go hungry when I worked in the burbs and forgot my lunch. I considered it punishment for being forgetful. So many raves about this place, I was expecting it to be decent at least. Glad I have my go to places as I'll be skipping Piece. Please don't PM me asking if I've lost my mind, because you like many others just looovvvee this place. Just consider it more for you.
