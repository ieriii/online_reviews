Let me clarify why three stars: The food was very good. I have really no complaints about the quality. I really enjoyed the small pieces of naan and tomato sauce they brought out first, the Indiana version of tortilla chips and salsa. I tried the Baingan Bharta, the eggplant dish, and an order of garlic naan and was quite satisfied with it. BUT, the service was, in a word, awkward. At least four people filled up my water, no one checked in on me, I waited quite a bit before any server came over to take a drink order (he had apparently been staring at me uncomfortably from the bar), and the general feeling was very hands-off and almost dismissive. Maybe it was because I was there by myself (my bill said "HURRY" on it, so perhaps they assumed I did not want to be there any longer than they apparently wanted me there). Maybe I give off an unintentional vibe of "leave me alone." But the entire experience was really.... awkward. And despite my fondness for the food, it was too expensive. If I had ordered the loudly steaming meat dishes/kabobs or something exotic, it would have been fine. But to pay $25 for naan and a vegetable dish seemed, to me, a bit much. If I had decided to try an appetizer or a drink, I would have added ten or so dollars, which may be par for the course in the River North area, and maybe it is my fault for choosing that location, but I was not looking to spend thirty dollars for a one-person Indian dinner. There was also a confusing mix of "I have lots of money and I know it"-type people, and some who looked they they just rolled off the couch and put on their flip-flops. And the couple next to me, featuring a guy who was either on his first date in years and really wanted to impress this girl, or on cocaine. Maybe both. At least he was entertaining. I'll keep looking for a replacement for Masala, although that really may not be possible.
