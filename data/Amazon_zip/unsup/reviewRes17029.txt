Boy, I haven't written a review in a while. Soooo here goes. I've heard about this place when I first moved back and so desperately wanted to go. Yes, because I really liked the name of the place and I love any color close to the hue of purple. I heard it was fancy and that you had to wait for a seat and there was NO standing allowed. They are not kidding. You walk into this entrance that looks like I'm going into a ship yard and then you go thru these enormous curtains to stand behind another enormous curtain to wait for a la-dee-daa seat. Thankfully it was a weekday and the wait wasn't long. I sat in the middle section where my friend knew the bartender who seems like he's worked there for a while. Boy, was he amazing and fast! I ordered a Moscow Mule and it was delicious! My friend ordered a Kings Cross and that was delicious! I was a bit starved so I ordered some sammies and they were amazingly tastey. I also was impressed with the pricing for a place as fancy and vainglorious as it is, it was affordable. I will definitely go back.
