Love the fact that the Marriott sits right in the middle of downtown Magnificent Mile where everything is walkable - shopping/restaurants, Wendella Boat Rides, Chicago Tribune, Chicago River Walk, etc. Convenience always helps when you are on trips!! If you don't mind staying in a small room (not your standard Marriott spacious hotel room but managed to get by with 4 people), then go for it! There is a bar and open lounge area right when you walk in and a Starbucks inside right next to the concierge.
