I loved Demera. I went there the other night with my girlfriend and the food was wonderful. The server went through the entire menu with us and practically ordered our dinner for us. She was a great help. The manager came to the table several times and brought us drinks and offered honey wine for us to try. The entire experience was wonderful.
