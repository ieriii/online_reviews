I have been a big fan of India House, but not this time. I was there last Friday. The place was packed, was asked to wait 30 mins. The groupon was expiring so lot of folks showed up. The restaurant did not seem to be prepared for it. There was a chaos. After waiting for an hour, I was able to get the table. The food was bad, Samosas were half fried, were cold. How can you screw up the samosas?? The entrees did not taste the same, looked like they were made in a hurry. The service was pathetic. I presented the groupon I had and was denied saying that it was already used. Cant believe they were ready to call me a liar and not believe me that I hadnt used it. The manager showed up, called himself Paulie, was a total jerk. I will never go again to this restaurant. The service is very important to me, and I was totally disrespected. Why do these restaurants used Groupon when they cannot handle it. Thank YOU INDIA HOUSE for a horrendous experience. I would rather go to Jaipur, Gaylord or Klay Oven when I am craving for Indian food.
