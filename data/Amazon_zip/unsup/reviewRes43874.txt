Great great breakfast/brunch stop. The French toast is a favorite, so is the oatmeal. Add to that the huge cups of coffee, and you're good to go. So why four stars then? Well, the crowd... if you go on the weekends anywhere past 10, you'll find yourself in a line the second you walk in the door. Even so, its worth the wait.
