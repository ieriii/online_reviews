Lockdown replaces Kuma's as my new favorite burger joint. Burgers and mac n cheese are on par with Kuma's, the two best in the city. But it's possible to find a seat at Lockdown (I've been quoted a 3 hour wait at Kuma's), the sides, appetizers, and beer selection are better at Lockdown, and the music (both volume and selection) are less extreme at Lockdown.
