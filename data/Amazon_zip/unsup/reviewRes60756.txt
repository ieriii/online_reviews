Totally awesome for dinner, and nice to have something in the neighborhood. My only complaint is that, aside from the Tom Waits for No Man, (vanilla infused whiskey, chai, etc...), the featured martinis tend to be more "interesting" than actually appetizing. I suggest sticking with your favorite (and no doubt less expensive) beer or mixed-drink of choice. Sweet potato fries are amazing, and I don't really even like sweet potatoes!
