Went there for brunch yesterday(Saturday) for the first time. I love that the brunch menu is changed every 3 weeks or so. We sat in the bar because its open seating, and there was a hi-top table open. We waited a while for our server, and the drinks were a little slow coming out. But i wont take a star off for the staff being busy, thats silly, they're just doing their job. We started off with some chips and salsa, as well as the appetizer plate. That was enough food for me, and my bf ordered a soup.The food was delicious. All the food is so colorful and beautifully plated. The app plate was even served on top of banana leaves! The salsa was delicious, as well as the guacamole. I don't think I've ever had guac that good... I was never a huge fan of Mexican food, but Rick Bayless, you have converted me!!! I cant say enough good things about this place. The decor was beyond beautiful and it was so exotic and calming(as weird as that sounds)... You will just have to go experience it for yourself!
