I've been hearing about The Purple Pig for some time, so when friends suggested it for brunch this past Sunday, I was eager to try it. Looking back, I should have waited. Of course it didn't help matters that I was very hungover and extremely hungry upon my arrival. It also didn't help that all I wanted was a big plate of eggs, bacon, toast and more eggs, bacon, and toast. Anecdotally, if you are looking for traditional brunch fair here, do NOT try The Purple Pig. That said, I tried my best to enjoy what was available, but at the end of the day, I was just underwhelmed. The fried Brussels sprouts were well seasoned, but not very satisfying. Also, I was not too impressed with the green cauliflower (just tasted like broccoli). In addition, I tried the "JLT" (jowl, lettuce, and tomato with a fried duck egg), the chicken thigh leg kebabs, the milk-braised pork shoulder, the Waygu sirloin steak, the bone marrow, and the mussels. Of all of these dishes, I was only really impressed with the mussels. They were prepared in a delicious cream broth that I couldn't help but sop up with the bread I was given. Yet, everything else was just... well... okay. I really liked my 2 bloody Marys and the service was good, but at the end of the day, I left The Purple Pig still hungry and with no burning desire to return. Please take what I've said with a grain of salt because, after all, I was hungover. Nevertheless, I stand by my experience here.
