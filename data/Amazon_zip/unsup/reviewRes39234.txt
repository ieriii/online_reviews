So how have I not eaten here before? That is what all my friends have been asking... Good question! I made it in for a quiet weekday brunch and it was really really really good! We split four selections between the two of us... A perfectly prepared scone, mean perfect, and that is rare it was buttery and crumbly, it was perfect! A spicy salad with pressed melon, that was new for me, and I loved every last bite of that spicy green sweet delight! Crab and egg benedict was perfect, and I do mean perfect! Finally a burger, yes please Ill take another! Juicy and wonderful! The part that really excited me was the whiskey menu, those of you who know me, know that I boast a whiskey and tequila bar in my house that is my pride and joy, about 50 whiskeys alone... Guess what the Longman and Eagle put my collection to shame and I like when bars put mine to shame, because I can hang there with my friends and not have to clean up afterwards! Watch out L & E I am coming to sample that whiskey and I am bringing my crew!
