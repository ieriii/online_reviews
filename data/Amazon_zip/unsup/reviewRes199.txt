I have been to Alinea five times since the place has opened.. Last night being my latest time.. I think the last time I went was about two years ago in July.. I was surprised to have had repeats of dishes I have had.. The hot potato cold potato and the black truffle explosion. Though they were good, I was hoping to have come back two years later and seen a lot of progress.. Service still impeccable, room still elegant and understated... I just remember previous dinners being a lot more over the top.. A lot more playful, perhaps even more scientific. They also have a new format which is only 19 courses.. I think I normally got 25 or 30 courses.. Things like frozen foie gras huckelberry soup stands out as being one of the best things I have eaten there, was I think 3 years ago.. Anyway, all I am saying is, I think the world may be catching up with Grant, perhaps some of the shock is gone but, what remains is still wonderful flavor combination and beautifully prepared dishes. The best dish I had last night was a recreation of a class Escoffier dish.. A perfectly made butter tart with a slice of squab breast and some forced squab meat and foie gras ovals. Beautifully done dish. The way he was able to take a classic dish and add a little modern twist but, keep it's integrity, it was amazing.. A monochramtic dish consisted of 6 components all stark white.. Really enjoyed the idea behind this dish but, the flavors escape me.. I have had something similar to this dish made by Pierre Gagniere a few years back.. Still it takes such skill and creativity to pull this dish off. Flavor combinations like combinig appricot with thai basil, absolutely beautiful.. Adding a dot of black liquorice to a dish which created a strong curry taste.. Also a revelation.. I guess that bar has been set so high by him that it might be impossible to top.. A wonderful experience non the less.. I will certainly be back next year.
