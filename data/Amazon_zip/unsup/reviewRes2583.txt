Hot Dougs is everything that it claims to be. It's gotten a lot of notoriety lately as it was on "The Best Thing I Ever Ate" and Anthony Bourdain's "No Reservations." I was a little skeptical though. We waited in line (in the rain) for about 45 mins, maybe an hour. But, it was SOOOOO worth it. Every time the door opened we got a whiff of those duck fat fries, which really were amazing. We are foodies and wanted to try a lot of the flavors. We ordered the Foie Gras, The Jack Daniels, The Game of the Week-- which was bison, The Curry, The Kiera Knightly, and the Elvis, I think. By far, the best was The Jack Daniels. It was spicier than the Kiera Knightly, which claims to be HOT! Now, we're from the South where pork fat rules....which it definitely did. We spent about 60 dollars on food for 4 people. Oh, not to mention the t-shirts...we got two...and the cab ride...which was $20 from downtown....it was an expensive adventure, but soooo worth it. Let's just say we took the train back....
