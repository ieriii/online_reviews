Still a fabulous, unique place to meet on a Friday evening. But... I loved being able to go through three different Greek white wines, 1/3 bottle and 1/2 bottle servings, to taste them one after the other. My favorite was the Skouras Moscofilero.  We had the squash again, still fabulous. The roasted bone marrow was a skimpy portion but tasty. A small dish of olives were soaked in a great brine. And the gabagool/coppa meat was excellent. Once again, a delightful exploration of food and wine. I'd love to make it a regular meeting place BUT... it won't happen. Not the way they're doing things now. I arrived, meeting my wife on her way home from work, to be told "Sorry, we don't seat anyone until the whole party is here." This meant standing around waiting 15 minutes for my wife to arrive, in a space with no waiting area, dodging groups coming in the door, moving for waitstaff and busboys. I understand waiting in the bar before being seating in a top restaurant. But not in a packed "cheese, wine, and swine" bar. It's a bad system if you want to meet people there after work, which is what many people will want to do here. So as much as I like the place, it'll get limited usage from me.
