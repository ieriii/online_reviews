Location, location, location. My honey and I went there Mother's Day weekend (for the Beer Fest) ... if we did decide to stay there again, it WOULD NOT be on a popular/holiday weekend or for 39.00 parking charge ~ which you had to do valet (bullpoo!) Check in is 3:00 and check out it 12:00 and the 39.00 dollar charge is for a 24 hr period, yet you have to have your car out by 12:00 or you pay for an additional day. I don't get that?!?! The room was nice and clean but the cleaning people knocking on our door at 7:30 in the morning, then at 9:00 a.m. was NOT cool.  But then again, we did have the pleasure of hearing this obnoxious family at all hours. The only reason that I would recommend the place is for it's location.
