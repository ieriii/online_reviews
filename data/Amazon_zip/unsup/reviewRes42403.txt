This place is one of the best Pho spots around. Pho is basically rice noodles, so if you like those you'll love Pho. And Tank is one of the best spots for it. The food is always fresh, and very tasty, the chicken broth is stewed in a huge vat filled with millions of bones making it super tasty! I recommend anything with beef, or shrimp in it, but I don't really do spicy so I can't talk on that. Nothing has ever tasted greasy or old/stale to me there. ever. The service is quick, and the food comes just as speedy to your table. They also make excellent bubble tea's and fruit drinks. All with fresh fruit. And there are always a lot of cute girls there.
