My dad took me here when we were on the Atkins diet. It was heaven for a crazy Atkins diet person like me. First, it is located on the gold coast so we were lucky to view some art during that festival. Then I was completely blown away with the size of the salad bar! I loved trying all of the different types of meat and I really appreciated the atmosphere. It didn't seem like an old country buffet type. This place really maintains the integrity of the meat without trying to make too much of a show about it. I hear Brazzaz is just like it but I would stick with the Fogo any day.
