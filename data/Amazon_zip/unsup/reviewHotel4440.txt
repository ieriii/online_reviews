It has its strengths and weaknesses. -The lobby/lounge is stunning! Brightly lit, classic luxury decor. As you wait in line to check in they even give you free little brownie bites that will melt in your mouth! - Attentive staff, ask and ye shall receive thy hotels offerings - decent room service, eggs any style with toast n' coffee - a snazzy Starbucks near the central lounge - private elevators for executive level guests - good concierge - central location in downtown The Not-so-Great's; - you can seriously get lost in this hotel! Honestly if there were a giant fire your screwed! - $18 dollar-a-day internet - Its an older hotel, lets call it ''old class charm'' - teeny bathrooms with zero counter space. In all, I loved simply wandering about the hotel, guests shuffling in and out, classy lounge, it never gets boring! It also is in a pretty sweet spot of Chicago so stepping right out into the city was fantastic. I think if we stayed here again, it would be be in a larger room but overall a definite memorable stay!
