Don't you hate when you order something called Mango Beef and there is hardly any mango or beef in it? Me too! Finding myself at Simply It for a group gathering, we had a broad selection of items brought to our table for tasting. The portions and variety were abundant. Everything tasted fresh and yummy too. I particularly liked the dumplings, pot stickers, Chicken Lemongrass, and the dessert, Fried Banana with chocolate sauce and whipped cream. But what really got me were two things: 1. The service was actually JOLLY! The staff were more than happy to pour our BYO wine, not cover their ears to shield from all of the "lady chatter", and did it all with a smile on their face. 2. One of the girls told me the story of the owner. Apparently he was abandoned by his two partners in the restaurant venture. Instead of giving up, he has pressed on to singularly insist that this business succeed. Now that is a vision I want to support! Thank you Simply It for the hospitality and phenomenal deals. I will be back to try the Ga Cuon Bo (Chicken Avocado appetizer)!!
