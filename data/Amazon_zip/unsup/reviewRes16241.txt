The boyfriend took me here Saturday night for my 'birthday dinner'. We came expecting a feast for the eyes, but possibly not much for the palate. Happily, we were wrong! Aside from having to wait a half hour past our reservation time, Carnivale delivered. The dining area is HUUUUGE - (seats about 650, total) but the noise level was surprisingly low. I loved the colors, the rich and lavish lighting, the 'Saturday Night Fever' dance floor that is magically floating over head, and the Latin music pulsing throughout. And the food was delicious! We had the empanada and the ropa vieja to start - loved the presentation, loved the flavor. For dinner, I ordered the fillet and the boyfriend had the arroz con mariscos. Our server had described a rib eye as the special, accompanied by, what he called, "potatoes on crack". Baked potatoes loaded with goat cheese and bacon and some other amazing additions. I REALLY wanted those potatoes with my fillet. Really.  I knew this was not Burger King - and therefore I was not guaranteed to have it my way. The server hedged. I protested "It's my birthday! Do you think the chef can make an exception?" To which our server responded, "EVERYONE in here is celebrating a birthday. Believe me, that's not so special." Ouch. Just when I was considering we should knock a few bucks off the tip for 'smarminess', our dinner arrived and I was happy to see that I did, indeed, have the 'potatoes on crack'.  They were DELICIOUS...as was the fillet. So tender and flavorful. We were told that Carnivale serves up an average of 900 dinners on a weekend night. Given that number, they'd have to be spot on with quality. And aside from the not so spot on comment from our server, this was a mighty fine birthday dinner, indeed!
