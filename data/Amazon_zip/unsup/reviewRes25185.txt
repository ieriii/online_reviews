I can honestly say, in my many years as a professional diner that I have never experienced fondue.  Fon-due, "what's that"?  I never knew that it was an interactive dining experience to be enjoyed by all at the table.  I actually thought that it was similar to the experience Benihana gives to its patrons. They cook. We enjoy the circuses. We have fun. We were a party of four and were entertained by the charismatic waiter Jason who treated us like royalty. He was confident in his suggestions, paired the wine appropriately, course by course and even shared humorous stories regarding the life and longevity of Geja's! Though it is dark in this romantic catacomb, the four of us never felt out of place, as we were all friends enjoying our time with each other,and not a couple on a secretive getaway from the chaos of our lives..... My only disappointment is that I lack the skill, precision and timing of the cooking process.  Yes, we were educated in the finer points of fondue, but when I am engaged in intense conversations of fodder, I do not have the mindset to think --"okay three minutes for the steak and 7 minutes for the vegetables, and 5 minutes for the pork, and shit I forgot to cook the chicken".  It is too consuming for me. The entire experience was enjoyable----and we loved our waiter Jason--- But the next time we go in there, we are hiring one of the staff members to do the cooking for us! I wonder if $20 a person at a table will suffice. Someone could have made $80 + a tip from the four of us and we would have given the restaurant another star!
