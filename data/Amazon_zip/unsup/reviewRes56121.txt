What did i just put inside me?Superdawg is so terrible that i dont even know where to begin.Overpriced.Oversoggy.Overhyped!The bun has a soft, slimy texture that to some may be appealing, but i enjoy food rather than slop. The relish has a neon green glow to it that is unsettling to look at. In fact, i'm positive that it was the number one cause of the stomach ailment im currently hampering.The fries are the only reason i've given this place one star. They are made there fresh, which raises my brow because of the filthy setting they are produced in. However, the taste of the fry is pretty satisfying, so i wont harp on it too much.You want my advice? Go to Gene n' Judes. Quality Hot Dogs. Good enough to cater a wedding!
