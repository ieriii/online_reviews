I can PROUDLY say that I was one of the first people to dine at this gem. It was right across the street from my family's business and the owner was friends with my dad. I was here before the hype, before the updated decoration, before the nice dishes and dining wear. I was here when Noon O Kabob was a hole-in-the-wall with only 7 tables and the prices were cheaper. This family-owned restaurant serves one of the best, if not the best, kabobs in Chicago. The location is not in the most charming neighborhoods in the city, but that doesn't skimp the pricing. Despite its' limited variety on the menu, they emphasize on their kabobs which is a good thing. I can get full on the bread and feta cheese alone! Their rice is to die for! Everything here is done right. I can't find one complaint. The service is on the ball and the owner is one of the most humble men you could meet. I'm glad to see that Noon is In competition with Reza, and looking forward to the restaurant's continuous progress and success.
