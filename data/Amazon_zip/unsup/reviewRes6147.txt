Steaks Steaks Steaks...My Wildfire expierence usually starts off by getting there an hour before my reservation so I can belly up at the bar for one of the best Stoli Martinis in town. You know it's a good martini when you get the thin layer of ice that rests ever so softly on top of your swirling drink. At this point I browse the menu to acheive the absolute biggest appetite I can. Half the time I go bone in rib-eye, and the other half it's the filet mignon. The steaks are cooked to perfection and the sides are just as good. I kindly ask the waiter to match a bottle of vino to the meal I just ordered and to keep it reasonably cheap. Now I have acheived the perfect meal.  The place has a dark oak, log cabin feel to it. Ambiance doesn't really affect me. You give me a steak that good and I'll go eat it in the alley behind the place.  All in all one of my favorite steak houses in Chicago. Also the ribs are out of this world.
