We came here for brunch with friends after finding both Tweet and M Henry overcrowded and with hour long waits, and wanting some quicker, yummy food, and we got some! Icosium was still quite empty before noon, so we got seated immediately. The service was just lovely. Very charming and quick. I had a make-your-own-crepe (you get to choose among about a hundred things to fill your crepe with! I had mine with tomato, mozarella, basil, avocado, greens, pine nuts, olives, olive oil, and probably more that I forgot about right now), which was really delicious, very fairly priced, and came with a decent mushroom soup. My friends had both sweet and savory crepes and we were happy with all of it. Oh and they have root beer floats and lots of coffee variations. It's not your average brunch place, but definitely great for a weekend morning with friends.
