Would like to give this a high 3. Perhaps 3.8, but definitely not a 4. In order to really give this place a chance I decided to go twice before deciding to write a review. To be honest, I was not going to write a review in the first place, since Mastros should speak for itself, but my disappointment brought me out-- to save you Yelpers. Chicago is definitely a steak city. So many great options -- you should be confident spending $$$$ and receiving great service and an even better meal. To that end, the best thing that Mastro's offers is a fairly priced wine list and its selection of sides and appetizers. Their steaks -- not so much. On both visits my steak has been undercooked. First time --ordered the Kansas City. Asked for it medium. It was so cold on the inside it tasted like the freezer. Second visit, 12 oz filet. Requested medium, received it slightly under medium rare -- still cold on the middle. Interestingly, the 8 oz filet my gf had was done nicely. Long story short -- their meat is not consistently cooked to perfection. Also, it seems like the quality of meat is slightly less than places like the Chop House or even Mortons. Have had much better, equally priced, meals at both of these Chicago offererings.
