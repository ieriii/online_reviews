Best Italian I've had in the city. Offers classic Italian and innovative dishes. Love the lobster ravioli, the pumpkin gnocchi and the salad with raspberries. LOVE the raspberry bread pudding. Everything is fresh, homemade and delicious. They usually have Monday night deals or sign up for their newsletter for special wine tasting events. Reservations for the weekend are strongly encouraged; there is not really a lobby area to wait for a table.
