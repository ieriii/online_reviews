This Iberian themed spot is located in the refurbished Blackstone Hotel, and I am sure you will find it as much of a delight as I did. On the ground level is a rather unremarkable bar area- decked out in the current modish fashion. But venture upon a spiral staircase into an impressive, mirrored dining room (I think this must've been a former ballroom), and you have an apt entree into a culinary adventure. We dined on a Monday evening for a business event, and partook of the chef's tasting menu. Not know what to expect we were delighted in every way. This allowed us to sample a wide array of starters, and some of the better entrees. The white wines- which I found a bit sweet to pair with Spanish- were nonetheless high quality. I might substitute the sangria on the next visit. Desert options are nice, and there is a nice menu of desert wines and ports to sample. Overall this was an enjoyable session for all the senses, and with nice and unobtrusive service to round the experience. I will surely visit again.
