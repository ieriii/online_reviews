After an unsuccessful attempt at eating brunch at M Henry, we headed to the much less crowded and just as good Uncommon Ground on a slightly hungover Saturday. I was VERY impressed. Our party of four was seated in a matter of minutes. Our server was very friendly and attentive, and clearly enjoying her job. I enjoyed the "uncommon rancheros" and a delicious glass of champage (hey, why not?). For $10, I got a perfect portion and a ton of flavor! I think my favorite thing about the huevos rancheros were the out of this world torilla chips served on the side. So fresh and crunchy, and obviously not out of a bag. There's just no substitute for fresh, organic ingredients.  The restaurant became crowded, but not so crowded we couldn't converse with the people at our table. Our server made it a point not to rush us, making it an even more enjoyable experience.  Not a single complaint here. Everything was really good and I'm looking forward to going back for their dinner menu.
