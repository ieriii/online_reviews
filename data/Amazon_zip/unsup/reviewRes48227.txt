Honestly, just another "good but not great" restaurants. We had some very good/unique dishes but everything just seemed to not be at perfection (i.e. "mmm taste pretty good...whats next?") Country Ribs - Supposedly one of their most popular dishes - it was seasoned well, but the meat was just not as tender as I had hoped for Escargot - meh Smoked Sabelfish - good, but nothing special. Sugar Snap Pea Salad - interesting mix of vegetables and nuts, but where was the snap peas? Aged Ham Sampler - prosciutto, serrano, and la quercia rossa - very good, but that doesnt take a chef to prepare. so at the end of the day - food was definitely good...but if you want to be blown away...go for Girl and the Goat instead...now that was phenomenal
