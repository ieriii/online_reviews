After wrapping up a business meeting in downtown Chicago, a few friends and I were looking for a "hole in the wall" with great Italian food, Sapori was recommended by a coworker and also rated very high on Yelp so we gave it a try. Took advantage of the quick and easy link to reserve a table on Yelp! Glad we did-the place was packed. I love a place with good table bread! Crusty, yet warm and soft inside. We devoured the avocado appetizer which had a lovely amount of garlic. Two of my friends went with the lobster ravioli which was delicious. Another enjoyed his pumpkin & butternut squash ravioli, or "dessert for dinner" as he called it. I had risotto with seafood: clams, calamari, scallops, and shrimp which came out on the hugest plate for one I have ever seen. It was good however the risotto was fishy tasting, like there was fish stock or clam juice or something used in making it. Not quite what I was expecting, but maybe that's my fault. Next time I'd probably order the seafood pasta instead.  Waitress was attentive and friendly, food came out quickly, and the ambiance was boisterous and energetic yet chic and romantic at the same time. Really felt the great energy of Chicago, and were primed for cocktails at out next spot. I would definitely come back.
