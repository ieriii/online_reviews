Good for a fancy romantic dinner. I am giving this place four stars as an average of three and five from me and girlfriend. The meat/seafood was good quality. But, your basically cooking it in oil and deep frying all the great flavor right out of it. Everything is cooked by you, which is kind of cool, but not really. One thing I did like was all the condiments to pair with the food. I love my condiments so this was right up my alley. The chocolate dessert pot was the best part for me. I had a frangelichino to accompany that, which was amazing. I feel the food is over priced. I don't mind dishing out that much money for a nice meal for the experience, but i feel I should be a little more happy with the actual food. The cuts of meat are great, its just the way they are prepared that bothers me. Maybe I should have tried the broth they offer instead of the oil. We got the most expensive meat/seafood combo, so maybe that is why it was so expensive. Although, I don't see much of an alternative on the menu without feeling like I'm missing out on something. Overall, a good place for a romantic atmosphere. They really nail that part on the head.
