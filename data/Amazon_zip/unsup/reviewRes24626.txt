Thoroughly solid space for a business dinner, even if we couldn't quite figure out how to get in the door at first. Our waiter recommended we order 3-4 dishes per person, so we picked a few that we really wanted and let him round out the rest of our selections. We wound up with 10 dishes for four people (3 girls 1 guy) and it was still way too much, but most of it was thoroughly delicious. Here are the standout items: 1: Red wine sangria. We ordered a pitcher, and it was delicious. 2: Serrano ham and fig salad. It completely wasn't what we expected, all wrapped up in the thinly sliced ham, but it was delicious nonetheless. 3: Seared scallops. They were oh my god good, with just the perfect amount of olive oil and crispiness at the edges. 4: A mushroom flatbread that just floored us. My one complaint is that the items all definitely contained more strong ingredients than were listed on the menu, including big chunks of smoky bacon in the salad and shiso (which I really don't like and picked off) on the flatbread. Other than that, completely legitimate experience.
