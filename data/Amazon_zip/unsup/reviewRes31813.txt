After reading all of these reviews, I may have to go back again and give it another try. But I have eaten at Chicago Diner a handful of times and each time I left disappointed at how bland my dish was. And my fiance was so excited to go since he has been a vegetarian for 12+ years now and ever since we moved to Chicago we kept hearing the hype about how it is a vegetarian's dream. He too was disappointed each time with his meals. We much prefer the Handlebar in Bucktown. But I'd be willing to give Chicago Diner another shot since it seems to please many people.
