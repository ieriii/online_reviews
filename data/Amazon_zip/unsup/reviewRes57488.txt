My boyfriend and I came here to celebrate my birthday and it was just perfect! The ambiance of the restaurant was very romantic, just what I was hoping for. The dim candlelight, wine decor, and live Spanish guitar playing made the dining experience that much better. I didn't request any specific seating, but we lucked out and got a nice intimate booth that felt very private. The staff was extremely friendly and knowledgable about the menu and guided us in the right direction of what to order. The service was quick and my high expectations were met! Overall I would rate this as the most romantic restaurant I have experienced in Chicago!
