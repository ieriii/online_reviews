90 Miles! Where have you been all my life?? I came here for the first time for a NYE double date, and it was love at first Empenada sight. Our reservation was for an early dinner at 5pm, which worked out perfectly because I am told the restaurant gets pretty busy. I had a great experience from the very beginning. Our waitress was really friendly, and gave us plenty of time to order. She even gave us some suggestions on appetizers because we didn't really know what we wanted. Of course, we decided on the Empenadas, and they were fabulous. We had all different flavors, each one more unique than the next. My personal favorites were the beef, and goat cheese. Highly recommended for a starter! My dinner was even better. I was in the mood for seafood, so I got the shrimp specialty dinner plate- Camarones al Ajillo (Garlic Shrimp) I loveddd it. It was a generous portion of six super jumbo shrimp marinated in garlic and spices. It also came with white rice, black beans, and fried plantains. Each item on my plate was full of flavor and complimented each other so well. Overall, I was one happy gal. I also got to try the Bistec (Steak) which was also very flavorful. The piece I had was just a bit chewy, but otherwise very enjoyable. I wouldn't mind ordering it in the future. We were all too full for dessert, but my date couldn't resist ordering a nice hot cup of cuban coffee (YUM). It was a perfect ending to a great meal. 90 Miles is winner in my book, and I will definitely be coming back!
