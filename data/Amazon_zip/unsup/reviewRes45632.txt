the chi is one of those cities overrun by faux-irish pubs. wilde is not one of them. what a beautiful bar!! and it's HUGE!! six of us descended upon this place last friday. thankfully we had a reservation; despite its size, wilde fills up fast. the menu is expansive, with options spanning traditional irish faves (yep. you can get your corned beef and cabbage and fish and chips fix here), with an array of additional unique options to satisfy any craving. i went with the grilled atlantic salmon club and i ordered a side of the mac and cheese (note: this was an extra cost because the traditional sides are choice of potato, salad or veggie of the day). it was worth the upgrade though! the mac and cheese was so rich, creamy and delicious...it rivals kuma's for flavor and texture (kuma's still reigns supreme for sheer ability to build your own.) other dishes on our table: shepard's pie; fish sandwich with irish cheddar; grilled salmon entree; buffalo chicken sandwich. only one of us made it out with leftovers, so you figure it out :) i will definitely return. i can see this being a fave of my boyfriend's (irish) family!
