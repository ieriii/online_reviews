I found another amazing burger in this city, and it comes with cool bar scene. Not sure what the negative b.s. is about on some of the reviews, but the burgers were truly amazing (my favorites are the 'border patrol' and the 'cruelty to animals'). Sure Kuma's is amazing, but so is Lockdown. The food and people are awesome. Plus, I love a rock concerts on large plasma tvs to go with my burger! Try for yourself, and you'll be blown away by these large, juicy burgers.
