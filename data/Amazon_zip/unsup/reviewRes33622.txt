Ooooooooooooo great place.  Off the Belmont stop and down the street (Clark), is Mia Francesca. Very classy, very expensive. Ok fine, SLIGHTLY expensive. It's one of those weird places where it's classy, but dressing up is optional. I've never been upstairs, but the downstairs is lit...romantically, for lack of a better word. Low lights, etc. My only gripe about this place is how small it is. Whenever I'd go there, I'd have to scooch myself all the way in so that both customers and staff could get by.  Needless to say, the food is excellent. It's ALWAYS crowded...ALWAYS. Like the Signature Room, we'd have reservations, but we'd still have to wait.  Bias: the family of my best friend in college knows the owner.  Definitely a place in Chicago to go to, but also like SR, not often (unless your wallet can handle it)...
