Hadn't been here for maybe 5 (7?) years... I should visit more often. My recent meal started in sort of anemic fashion - sweet potato fries were just ok. Good albeit small selection of beer... I got a micro IPA that was tasty. The fried chicken was delicious, light breading (and pan-fried if my memory serves me correctly) and the collard green side was so good that I have plum forgotten what my other side was!  My obsession with Scooter's being open again precluded me from sampling dessert.  Overall, this place is not super amazing, but a good option when you're craving some southern goodness and you don't want to haul down to Heaven on Seven or down (or up) to Dixie Kitchen.
