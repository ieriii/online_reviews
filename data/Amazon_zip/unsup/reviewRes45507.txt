The decor and interior design was the best thing about this place. They must have spent a mint. Even though it was busy we lucked out with a prime table. The place is also huge (for this area). I can't recall what used to be in this space before Wilde's. The fact that this is a fairly new place didn't detract from the ambiance in any way. I'd say the food was just above average. About what I'd expect for the type of place and the prices. I just had a Wilde burger, which was adequate, and tried some Shepherd's Pie which was ok. The waiter never came back to check on us after the initial check in, and I no one ever came to refill our drinks. Oh well. It was busy, but still. A nice place to go with family or anyone in the older crowd. A few televisions throughout with sports on, but the place stears clear from becoming a sports bar. At least during lunch. Nothing special but nothing bad.
