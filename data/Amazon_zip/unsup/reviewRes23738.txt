I was clueless about this restaurant until a friend of mine began working there, and after that I was hooked. She brought me an Icosium crepe, which contains baby spinach, roasted bell peppers, carmelized onions, and arugula cheese and at first I was wary, but it turned out to be absolutely WONDERFUL, especially with a little of their hot sauce on top. Since then everything I've tried has been absolutely wonderful and that includes WONDERFUL= Icosium Crepe French crepe w/ escargo sauteed with garlic and brie cheese =) My make your own crepe (my secret) Smoke salmon w/ cream cheese Raspberries w/ Nutella and Chocolate w/ a side of Ice cream I am always looking forward to going back and trying something new. All savory crepes come with a soup which is either a lamb stew, or a vegetable soup (I'm more partial to the vegetable soup). I also love their apricot iced tea, and their coffee drinks. The decor is marvelous as well, with the walls covered in beautiful tapestries, lovely lamps hanging from the ceilings, and the turkish coffee served with quaint brass pots and cups. The crepes run about $10
