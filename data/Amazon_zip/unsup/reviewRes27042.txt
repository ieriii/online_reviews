The gastro-snazz of blackbird crossed with the chilled out vibe of Girl/Goat with better food and experience than both! I rate within categories, as in if it's the best cheap dirty taco join that could exist, I'll rate it higher than a mediocre 'nice' restaurant. ge takes the cake (and the plate, and the appetizer, and your heart) for a great meal in superb environs. I took the lady here last night for her birthday and couldn't have made a better choice. If you want a chicken leg the size of your aunt's thigh and four pounds of mashed potatoes don't go here. If you value well balance, excellent tasting food, with knowledgeable/helpful/enjoyable servers check out ge. They have everything a white tablecloth pierre-as-maitre d' spot wishes their food was, and it's served in a relaxed, spacious, and soothing setting. It's not cheap and it won't stuff you (so don't complain), but just go. Onion Bisque - I'll refrain as I don't prefer onions generally, but I'm sure it's good to someone normal Charred Octopus - fantastic. octopus was delicious enough to eat by the fistful, and the complements worked really well with the flavor and texture Fois Gras - Seared FG at its best. Again I could have eaten just the FG for hours, but the rhubarb/crumble/strawberry transformed it into something completely new/different/awesome Atlantic Swordfish - expertly cooked, great taste without being too fatty or creamy Colorado Lamb - the lamb of the gods with balanced backdrop of canneloni and mushrooms could not be done better, plus the interesting twist of eucalyptus froth This and four drinks were ~$220 with tax/tip and it's worth five meals anywhere else in the city, so it's actually an awesome deal. And I can't leave without saying that Whitney was an excellent server, put up with my endless questions on what the awesome things I was eating. And the lemon cake with blackberry sorbet they brought out for the birthday was gracious and delicious.
