This has to be one of my favorite places in all of Chicago. OK, my bias is heavily skewed because I live so close, but I have to find something on the menu I don't enjoy. Every sandwich is a perfect example of Cuban fare, the dinners are always so flavorful and generously portioned, and the cafe con leche is the perfect start to your day! This location is the small take-out heavy store. You can eat here though, as they have a u-shaped counter (you sit on the inside of the U) off to the left of the cash register area. Great for lunch! The service here is always excellent too, and the bread pudding is not to be missed.
