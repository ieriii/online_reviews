Before I get hanged for my one-star rating of this Yelper's favorite, I'll tell you why the rating suffered: cleanliness. Back to that in a moment. The food was great. No complaints there. Our salads were huge and very fresh tasting, and the pizzas were delicious. My problem with it: my boyfriend witnessed one of the servers dipping her finger into a glass of water to fish something (a "floatie", I'd call it) out of there. Disgusting.  Needless to say, this was a huge turnoff; the only reason we continued on with the meal (our pizzas were not yet out when he saw this) was that this woman was not handling food, only taking care of putting down water glasses and refilling water. I went thirsty after finishing my wine because I was so creeped out. It's really too bad. The food was great (albeit a bit pricey), but I'll never be back.
