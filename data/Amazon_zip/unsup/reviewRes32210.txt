I ate here for a second time because we had friends in town. The place is extremely loud, so if your looking for a quiet romantic place this is NOT the best choice. The oxtail potstickers and brussel sprout salad are KILLER. The rolls were ok, nothing special, and the drinks are not worth the price.
