Because I want to live past 35, I'm not a fried chicken guy. But I am completely hooked on Crisp's Seoul BBQ. It's got a nice sweet bite, and cooked perfectly. My wife didn't like her Buddha Bowl, it was a little cold and limp, but with a little extra Schezuan sauce and a hit in the microwave it was much improved.
