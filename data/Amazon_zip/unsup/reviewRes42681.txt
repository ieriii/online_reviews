5pm on a Friday. LOTS of empty tables. My husband arrived before me to have a drink and order an app; but the snotty hostess wouldnt let him sit down. Ok, I've been a hostess before...I understand waiting for the rest of the party. But, she proceeded to sit other tables that werent complete. My husband went up and asked her again if he could sit down and get started. She rolled her eyes and walked away! So I got there, eager to eat, and he was so annoyed we left and went somewhere else.
