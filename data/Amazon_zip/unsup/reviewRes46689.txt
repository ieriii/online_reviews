I've always liked Lettuce Entertain You restaurants so when I finally made it here, I wasn't disappointed. The salad bar has a wide variety of things to choose from. That would have been totally enough for me, but we also split an entree, which was also good. While we were waiting to be seated the bartender concocted a really delicious drink for me too. My only complaint was the seating was a bit crowded and finding parking there is nearly impossible. Otherwise a great establishment.
