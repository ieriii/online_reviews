I hear so many people talk about Crisp, so I decided to finally try it out. I was so surprised how good it was. We ordered a basket of fried wings with a mix of sauces. The wings are so crispy, which I love. I saw that they had the rice bowls, so I ordered one. Perfect!! I was surprised that they had picnic tables, since looking for the right combination to sit at was the only challenging thing. Just writing this review, makes me want to go back for some wings.
