Best sushi I've had in the city and cool spot too. Still don't know why people think coast sushi is good. Interesting crowd had your typical white preppies with two generic blonds at one table. A table full of your 100$ tshirt crowd and then a couple hipsters mixed in and nondescript black building with trendy furniture and some video playing on wall behind me. Good people watching. I didn't realize it was byob so had to run across to the cvs, easy. Sushi was great and so was the service.
