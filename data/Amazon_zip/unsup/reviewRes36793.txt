I have been here a few times, mostly for Sushi and appetizers. This place is "trendy" for the area and can be packed in the evenings, even during the week. Ambiance is nice, and great to see a fresh look in the area to spruce up Broadway. It's a BYOB, and that is always a plus in my book. The sushi is fresh and I am a fan of the city maki rolls. They have a nice variety of rolls, although I wish they had more. The thai selection of the menu seems fair enough, and they have a few other noodle selections as well. The crab rangoons are heavenly, I just had them for the first time on my last visit and now I'm regretfull I hadn't tried them before. If you order online you can get a free order of them if you spend $20 or more! If I'm craving sushi on the near-north side, this is my go to place.
