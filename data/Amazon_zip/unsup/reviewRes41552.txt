Went there for their Sunday 7 course dinner and I have got to say it is definitely in my top 3 dining experiences in Chicago, in fact, that I have ever had. I absolutely was in love with everything that was served. Unlike Tru and Charlie Trotters where in my experience a big focus is on unusual and exotic combinations and presentation, Bonsoiree focus is just giving you mind blowing food. Its a tiny space and I don't see how anyone could eat here without reservations. The 7-course dinner it is priced lower than most other course places. It's also BYOB which is a huge plus. My husband and I made hmmmm noises during every bite and have not stopped raving about it. The only sad part of the dinner is when we were at our last course and I realized there would be no more food coming.
