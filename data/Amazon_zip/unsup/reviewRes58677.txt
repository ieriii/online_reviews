I love Mia Francesca and have been going to this restaurant since it opened. I have celebrated many special occasions over the years at Mia - everything has always been outstanding.However, this past Saturday, we made a reservation for 6 people at 8:30 to entertain friends from out of town. We arrived on time and were informed that it would be a few minutes until a table was ready due to several tables not turning over.After 45 minutes past our reservation, there was still no table available. All we were told was that our table was finished but wasn't leaving and they could not tell us when we would be seated, nor did they make any efforts to offer us a round of drinks or any other accomodation.There is simply no excuse to not honor a reservation after 45 minutes or to find some other way to accomodate us. The whole point of having a reservation is to enable the guests to coordinate and plan an evening. Had we been on our own, we might have stuck it out, but our guests had additional plans and could not wait indefinitely.I hope this is an isolated incident but wanted to share this experience so that other diners who require a reservation to be honored are not put in the same position. VERY DISAPPOINTING (but I can't give them only 1 star as they are usually a 5)!
