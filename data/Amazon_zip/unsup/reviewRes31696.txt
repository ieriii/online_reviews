Sunda sure does NOT live up to the hype. We came here for one of my girl friend's birthday dinner. It was a group of about 10 or so. First off, service was horrible. Food was okay. I did not order a hot entree, I had sushi. Sushi was mediocre. The server forgot one of our friend's order, mixed up another order and overcooked one of my other friend's fish entree.  I had a good time only because I had dinner with great company. Overall, my experience at Sunda was not great. I would not come back here, ever!
