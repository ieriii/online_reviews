I'll make this a quick review, because there are so many already.I give Giordano's 5-stars because it is always good, always what I ordered, and always within the time-frame of the order (if delivery). Eating in is always great, as the atmosphere is fun, Italian-ish, has a bar, personable waiters/waitresses, and just all-around a good time to be had.The food is spectacular. It is the best deep-dish (or otherwise) pizza I have had in this city so far. I have had Giordano's, Connies, Uno's, etc, and Giordano's wins hands down by far. It is even great delivered, if not better. I had Giordano's, in fact, twice this week with friends from out of town, and the better of the two (if I can even compare them) was the delivered pizza, I think. It may have had to do with the temperature of the pizza, but I'm not sure.In summa: great pizza, great atmosphere, great service. The only downside is, sometimes, the wait be a bit long. But that's only because the pizza is so good everyone goes there. Go to Giordano's - you won't regret it.
