I walked into this super cute space with exposed brick and unique ceiling fans, which look like tiny silver helicopters at around 8 a.m. on a Friday. I needed breakfast, bad. There were three occupied tables and my waitress helped me decide on the lemon & raspberry flapjacks. She was so right! They were excellent. The flapjacks were enveloped in a lemon zest whipped creme and were sprinkled with real raspberries. It doesn't get any better than this. I spent under $11.00 without tax for my flapjacks, a side of hash browns, and a cup of coffee. I definitely recommend checking out the Bongo Room on the weekdays. It's so worth it.
