Okay, the above rating is for the one particular item I ate the other day on my first visit to this place. The Cheka Chouka Crepe. Dude, Wow, Yum. If I could have hi-fived that crepe I would have. But Crepes don't have hands. So I ate it in admiration. It didn't seem to mind. Good Stuff. 'Nuf Said.
