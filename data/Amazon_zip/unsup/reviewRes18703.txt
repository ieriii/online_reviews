I went to Caro Mio based on the favorable reviews from Yelp. My impression is that the reviewers must have been joking! The staff was wonderful and friendly, but the food was mediocre at best. The pizza bread appetizer resembled the quick concoction I make my two year old for a snack. The pasta was just okay for the hefty price tag. Don't even get me started on the overwhelming chemical smell of the bathroom...
