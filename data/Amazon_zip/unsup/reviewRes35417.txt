I went to Shaw's for my first time this past week. I can safely say that I wouldn't mind going back. The food took a little longer than I would have liked but good food is supposed to take time. The most surprising thing was how good their sushi was. Typically, I wouldn't order sushi from an all American seafood joint but it was really good!
