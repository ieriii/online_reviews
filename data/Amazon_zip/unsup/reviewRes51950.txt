Wow wow wow! Bad bad bad service! Having come here before and having an ok time, I recommended this place to my out of town guests! Terrible Idea to say the least! It was a beautiful sunny day so we opted for outside! We were told that the waiter could not take our order as outside orders handnt started, but we were able to go and self order!!! Which we did ! No later than 5 mins after we sat down a waiter was out there taking other peoples orders. We ordered individual pizza's that were ready already so no wait, other people ordered pizzas that needed to be made! They were told it would take about 45 min for the deep dish so patient they were! 50 mins later no pizza and no one to let us know what the delay was! We go in and check on it and they say 5 mins! 5 mins later no pizza And no one telling us what's going on . 1:30 min we get the pizza, reason for the delay the dough got stuck in the oven so they had to make another one. At no point did they explain this to us! We ordered two pizza so if one had a problem they should have brought the other out and said what the issue is! They took $8 off, what's $8 when you buys food worth $70!!!! Then we get the food in a box, not cut and on plastic plates! We were seated outside with no one waiting on us! The service was terriable , the pizza was ok. Would I come back no no no ! Do I recommend it no! Better off at cafe UNO or deus, better service and taste! The dough is like maize meal!!!
