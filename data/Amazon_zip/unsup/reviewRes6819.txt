My friends and I reserved a table for New Years Eve. It wasn't too crowded but it wasn't empty either. We arrived a little early for a few drinks. The signature cocktails, especially the Pimm's Cup were great. The bartenders are really nice and very attentive. There's an upstairs party section, the downstairs restaurant looking into the kitchen, and a front bar area. The food is delicious. It's basically trendy barbeque.There are chips and butter pickles waiting for you when you sit down. You're looking at some fried green tomatoes and hush puppies. The portions are generous and the barbeque sauces (there are four of them) are so flavorful. If you're looking into dessert after consuming your entire meal - share. I ordered the cappuccino peanut brittle ice cream expecting 2 scoops. No, it was easily a pint of ice cream in the shape of a cake slice. Excellent, but huge. I recommend this place if you're hunkering for some barbeque, particularly some pulled pork.
