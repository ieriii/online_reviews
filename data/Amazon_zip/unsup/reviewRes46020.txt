I've been here on more than 1 occasion. Reminds me of a classier Cheesecake Factory. Love the location. Every time i've been here the wait is no longer than 15 minutes. Try to request a booth by the window. Love the view :) Food and drinks were really good. Portions are huge and I usually end up taking half of it home. Some of the deserts take 30 minutes to cook, so let them know ahead of time so you're not waiting too long. I was with a group of people so it didn't matter. Definitely one of my favs downtown :)
