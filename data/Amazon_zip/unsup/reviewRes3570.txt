I wandered into this place when it first opened and chatted it up with the two owners. They were super friendly and you can sort of tell that they really wanted to do this for the love as well as being able to set their own hours! The Seoul Sassy chicken was actually a recipe from one of the owner's mom. It's delicious and is normally juicy and plump. Recently, the chicken has been a little less juicy and a little less plump. The owners used to do the chicken but now that it's become a lot more popular, I think the hired help does the chicken now. I also recommend the Baby Buddha bowl over the other bowls. You get less variety of vegetables but it's just as filling. This place has come a long way. They now take credit card and the fridge is loaded up with an assortment of drinks (including sac-sac or bon-bon!) Atmosphere is punched up from the days when this was the Rice Box. It's a lot brighter and more inviting now. I really do wish they were open later than 9pm on some evenings. I just grab takeout later than 9pm on certain weeknights!
