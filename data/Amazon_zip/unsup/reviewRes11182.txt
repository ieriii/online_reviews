Recently visited Chi-town for the first time. Friend, native of Chicago, recommended this cute joint. Agreed! Def. worth the wait!! Must try: Fresh squeezed Orange Juice!!! Chocolate Tower French Toast - yum yum yum! Breakfast Burrito!! Red Velvet Pancakes w. Vanilla Cream - like a warm cupcake (not too sweet). Croissant Sandwich the entrees comes with seasoned potatoes - Oh, so good!! I'm a fan!! Enjoy.
