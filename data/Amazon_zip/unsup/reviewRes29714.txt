Underwhelming at Best! I decided while I was visiting family in Chicago to do something "different" and so I thought a trip for some yummy curries would be in order. To start I have nothing to complain about in regards to service or decor. Yes, the waitstaff is standoffish and semi-cold, but living in Seattle has forever changed my views on what to expect in this category. I didn't mind if they looked put off as long as they got me my food in a timely fashion. So on to the eats. We started with the Fried Tofu Satay and the Spring Rolls. The fried tofu came out in "sticks" and tasted chewy, not crispy. The accompanying peanut sauce tasted like the stuff I can buy from the grocery store. The spring rolls were straight up foul. They came drenched in this gelatenous sweet and sour sauce. It was unedible. Next we did the Papaya Salad and Tom Yum with chicken. The Papaya Salad was decent, as was the Tom Yum. The soup was a bit watered down and not nearly as flavorfull as others I've had in the past.  After seeing that every table ordered the Crab Rangoon we decided to follow suit, even though this is not a Thai dish. It was good for what it was...wonton wrapper fried with cream cheese and some kind of Krab.  The entrees were totally hit and miss. I shared the full fried Red Snapper in a red curry with my mom. It was the highlight of the night. Yes, a whole fried fish is kind of novelty, but the fried bits covered in curry was quite nice. I ordered the Green Curry with Chicken and Fried Tofu and just kind of looked at another watered down version of what I love so much. My sister got the Chicken Satay...it looked like chicken on a stick and my step dad got some shrimp dish which also looked meh. All in all....big disappointment...the only reason I'm even going three star is for the fried fish and the decent Papaya Salad...otherwise don't waste your time.
