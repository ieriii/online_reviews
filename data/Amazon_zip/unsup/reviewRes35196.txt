I can't visit Chicago without eating here at least once. Absolutely love it. It doesn't matter if you order fish, shellfish, or just a sandwich. Lunch, brunch, or dinner.  The Maitre d' is the same every time I go and the service is top-notch without being presumptious or pushy. I was referred here a few years back and recommend it to anyone who will listen. btw, love the Vargas pin-up in the bathroom. I wonder if they'll sell it . . .
