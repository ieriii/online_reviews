I have been to Tru twice. The first time was the night I put the ring on my wife's finger, the second time was to celebrate a new job. Tru is a choreographed experience from the beginning to the end.  Everything is seamless as they take your coat, escort you to your table, to your fabulous dinner. My wife and I loved every piece of it, and it is a three hour experience (don't plan on dinner and a show). Tru is expensive, but it is very very special. Do not expect to see Gale Gand (from Sweet Dreams) or Rick (famous Chef) on-site . . but that doesn't hurt the food. Both times my wife and I went to Tru we ordered a three course menu and added an optional course (1st time Cheese, 2nd time upgraded the dessert to a 3 course chocolate tasting). Though the courses themselves are balanced (not cheesecake factory huge), we did not go away hungry. . .and I'm a big guy :) Nice Touches: Setting the plate for all members of your party simultaneously, the coffee cake for the next days breakfast, an amazing bathroom (if not that functional).  Tru will always have a special place in our hearts. My wife and I love great restaurants and Tru beat Paris' Tour D'Argent hands down (ripoff), and is a little bit more of an experience than Gary Danko's in San Fran. Now that I live in Chicago I look forward to trying Aliena and Charlie Trotters
