I will keep this short & sweet... Chicago is a beautiful, clean city! As far as our hotel stay for a week not so beautiful. The bed was very comfortable, but the room felt dirty. We were supposedly upgraded to a room with peeling wall paper and very scuffed up furniture and walls. I wouldn't consider that an upgrade. The location and beautiful city, good company of my significant other and bed were about all that I remember.
