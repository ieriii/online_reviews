Tuesday night. I dropped a Franklin enjoying some of the tastiest house margaritas. Margaritas = Kryptonite. Sure the cuisine is not Rick Bayless---but if you came here expecting that I would question your sanity. However, after a few delicious margaritas, you'll swear it's the perfect pairing. Make friends out on the patio. They'll keep that drink full. Try to keep track.
