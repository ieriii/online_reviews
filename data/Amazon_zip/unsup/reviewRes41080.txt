Henri: Everyone raves about this place. I just don't get it; the food is mediocre at best. The wait around peak times is insane and when you do sit, you're ignored for a long time.There's many other better restaurants in the vicinity, try something new. Nicole: Love the food and the price is reasonable; however, the service is awful. I use to live close to this restaurant so would pop in often but after continuously being ignored by the staff we decided to stop going. Plus, the Pho is better at Pho 777 and the Thai restaurant, Thai Avenue, (next door on Broadway) both have wonderful food at a good price and the staff is GREAT.
