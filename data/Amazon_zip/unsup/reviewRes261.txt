We went to Alinea last night, which completes our trio of experimental dining (Moto, WD-50 in New York, and now.. Alinea). I have to say... Alinea is great. The entrance is really cool, the service is what you would expect, and the food is excellent. Achatz is indeed a genius, but in the end... the experience isn't really that memorable. I feel like he cut his teeth at Trio, and is delivering interesting, but not amazing food, in an interesting but not amazing space. What I would say tho.. is if you're going to spend $450+ on dinner for two... and you've got one place to go in Chicago, we'd still go to Moto. Achatz's food is interesting, but not amazing... which when you're dropping that sort of cash, you need to be able to walk away and remember your experience for months to come. At Moto we had exactly that... both for the service and food. So... if you haven't been to Moto, I'd go there first... if you have... Alinea is great, but it won't be quite as fantastic.
