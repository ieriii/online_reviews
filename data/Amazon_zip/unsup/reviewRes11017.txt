Great pizza, awesome brews and live band karaoke. If you haven't tried live band karaoke....try it! You feel like a friggin rockstar! Been here several times. The place is pretty packed on the weekends, but the pizza is worth the wait. There brewery is great too. The Golden Arm is my favorite. A bit crowded, but always a good time.
