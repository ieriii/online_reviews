Good stuff. The ahogado was spicy and memorable. The Gunthorp chicken was pretty decent. The churros were..... amazing. Freshly fried and perfectly salted/peppered. It's too hot to try the hot chocolate, but I sure will be back in the colder months for some of that sugar goodness.  Avoid the lunch crowd (and, therefore, the absurd wait) by getting there before 11:30am during the week. It's good stuff, but I'm not quite sure how worthy of a long wait it is...
