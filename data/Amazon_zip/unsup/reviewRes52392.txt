Meat lovers paradise. Visited this lovely meat palace for the second time with the boyfriend and a few friends last Saturday and just like the first time, it was abso-FREAKING-lutely DELICIOUS. Compared to Texas de Brazil, they have a wider selection of meat and their salad bar boasts such food such as oysters, mushroom risotto, pesto pasta salad, proscuitto, and much, much more. Granted, Texas de Brazil does have a larger salad bar, but I prefer Brazzaz's meats. The "Culotte" (which I also believe is the house special) is my absolute favorite--it has a nice ring of fat around the edges and adds so much flavor to the already flavorful meat. Another thing I love about this place is that they come around with pineapple skewers. It's a nice break from the meat and they're perfectly ripe. BUT, when ordering a dessert, stay away from the creme brulee. There is little to no crust on top and they added chocolate syrup to the bottom? Don't know what that was all about, but stay away. Other than the dessert mishap, Brazzaz still ranks #1 in my book for Brazilian steakhouses. *One note to those who complain about the salad bar: you're going to Brazzaz to eat MEAT. Hence, "Brazilian STEAKHOUSE." You want to pay $50 to fill up on salad, go elsewhere!
