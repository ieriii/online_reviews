Went here last weekend. Had the "sexy reds" wine flight. Outstanding! Also, I had the rabbit - it was very good. I liked the ambiance of the restaurant - but it was really cold. One other thing - the service was very good. The waiter was very personable and seemed to arrive whenever I was looking for him.
