A great place to take Ma and Pa and wow them. My parents get excited being able to look out on Michigan Ave. They also love wine, good appetizers, and friendly servers. I like this place because I would label the food as "safe." You cant really go wrong. Everything I have ordered I have loved. They need to like, give you half of what they do though. I mean who actually eats that big of portions? I want to be able to enjoy appetizers, entrees and desserts but for this place you have to sacrifice a course if you dont want to explode. Dude. The strawberry shortcake? whoa. whoa! I have to take away a star because they dont take reservations. I hate sitting and waiting when I'm so hungry I could eat my arm.
