I like this place's appetizer bar a lot. I would probably be pleased with just that, but the two times I've been we had the full course, and the meat has always been really good. I feel like the service is kind of slow, but I guess that's what you get at places like this, with all the different chefs walking around. My Watermelon Mojito was delicious, but really weak. But are drinks ever strong enough? Kind of died eating the seafood chowder. So great.
