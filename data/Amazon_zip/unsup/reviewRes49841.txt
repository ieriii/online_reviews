After my most recent visit (a couple weeks ago), I felt the need to adjust my rating for Las Tablas (from 5 to 4 stars). I went with a friend on Friday night and the place was almost empty. It was nice because it wasn't as noisy as usual and we could actually hear each other most of the time. The service was fine and the food was excellent. The portions seem smaller even though the prices were the same. I still recommend this place - mostly for the food.
