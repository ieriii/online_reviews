While on a weekend trip to Chicago recently, my wife and I went to Giordano's in search of the best pizza in Chicago. I had heard all the hype and wanted to see if this place was as good as I had heard. We just beat the dinner rush and were seated right away. Our very friendly waiter came by to take our order and tell us about the menu. We started our meal off with a plate of fried mushrooms. The mushrooms had a ton of breading on them and we started to get full very quickly. We decided to peel the breading off, so that we would still be hungry for the pizza we had ordered. Upon removing the breading, we found some of the tiniest mushrooms we had ever seen. All in all, the mushrooms were not the greatest. After about 40 minutes (it takes time to make those big pies) our pizza came out. We ordered the 10" small deep dish pizza with pepperoni, sausage and mushrooms. It looked amazing sitting there on the table! We dug right in and were very happy. The pizza was big enough for us to eat 4 pieces each. We made it through, but those last two pieces were tough and we had that "too full" feeling afterwards. As far as the taste went, it was a very good pizza but fell just a bit short of "best pizza ever" status. It was not really that big on flavor though and the crust was quite bland and we found ourselves just putting the big pieces of crust aside and not eating them. I thought I was going to break my teeth three different times when I bit into caraway seeds from the sausage. Overall we had a good meal and would definitely come back here. As for the best pizza in Chicago though, I continued my search as I did not quite find it here.
