For years I've heard how great this place was but I always felt like what's the point in going here when I can just go to Cheescake Factory? Well, it finally happened. I had friends in town who wanted to walk the Mag Mile so we ate here. I have to say that the ambiance was very nice. Although it looked like Cheescake Factory it was less busy. It seemed more chill. Music was playing and it was very relaxing. Okay...so far I'm impressed. Next I ordered the pineapple martini. It was delicious...wonderful...sweet...pineapply. However, it was lacking in liquor. So I was torn...it tasted really good but at the end of the day we drink alcohol to get tipsy. When you're paying 12 dollars a pop...well you want to get tipsy not just feel refreshed. For dinner I ordered the chicken meatball sandwich. Now, for whatever reason the entire table got their food but they were running behind on mine. The server was very apologetic and the manager came over to apologize for the delay as well so I won't fault them for this. When I finally got it, it was pretty good. Not overly exciting but solid. I would probably get it again. Overall, this was a pretty good experience. I could definitely see myself coming back here again!
