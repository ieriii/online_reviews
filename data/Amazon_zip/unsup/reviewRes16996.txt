Sexy! I think this is the only word that can describe this lounge. It is just beautiful and sexy. The drinks are pure class too. I am in love with the design of this place, and I love how it is hidden with no street numbers or exterior sign. It actually looks a little like a crack building from the exterior. This is definitely the perfect place for a date, or to sip late night cocktails with your sweetie. Dress to impress as your attire should be swank like the bar.
