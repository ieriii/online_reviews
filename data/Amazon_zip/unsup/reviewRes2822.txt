I wish I could give 3 1/2 stars, but I'll have to go with 3. Admittedly, I generally wasn't a happy camper while living in Chicago. Feel free to add a star to any of my Chicago reviews. Tru just didn't measure up to the standard set by French Laundry (or even Gary Danko). The service was impeccable, but the food didn't blow my mind and the dining area was too large. The bar area and entrance are perfect, but the actual dining room feels cavernous. I am a huge fan of clean, modern lines, but the far-too-high ceiling and lighting distracted me from the food and made me feel somewhat self-conscious. The tables are spaced far enough apart that conversations stay relatively private, but the spaciousness made me more aware of wait staff approaching the table than I would have liked. It was a fun birthday splurge, but I don't think I'll ever be back.
