I love Fifty/50! This is my favorite place to go in the city. The food is amazing, the staff is awesome,the crowd is fun, the bar is super clean, and the owners really know how to run a bar. They have great drinks and their food is not your average bar food...its way better, they have a very well put together menu with lots of variety. This is the perfect place to watch a game, hang out with friends, have a party...it's perfect for anything any day of the week. The DJ is always good! There is always something going on at Fifty/50! I love, love, love this place and have only the best things to say! I have had a great experience every single time I've been here, i definitely recommend going here.
