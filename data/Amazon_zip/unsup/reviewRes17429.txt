whoah. so we ordered food for several coworkers, and the delivery guy forgot to bring three of our meals. so we called him, and he came back -- with just one of the three, and it was only the entree without any rice or naan to go with it. major fail. how do you manage to fail to deliver multiple people's meals TWICE?
