Irazu has been on my bookmarks list forever, and we finally made it there last night. We arrived about 6:30 and there was no wait at all, but there was a line by the time we left.  The food was fresh, tasty, plentiful and reasonably priced. We started with the guacamole (I needed to add some salt and pepper). Hubby got the chicken tiko, which was amazing -- as usual, I liked what he got better than what I ordered, which was the steak with onions. Very flavorful, but the fried plantains on the side were a little too greasy, even for me.  We finished with the famous oatmeal milkshake. Our waiter said it tasted like a Cinnabon in a cup, which wasn't a bad description, but I'd say it's more like an oatmeal cookie and milk put in a blender. Very yummy, but it got all frozen and grainy at the bottom. No matter, we were too full to finish it anyway. It is important to know that Irazu is cash only, and BYOB. And thanks to my dear Yelpers, I was prepared!
