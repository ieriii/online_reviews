The SO and I went for dinner last night at RBC. We have been waiting and waiting for months to try this place and it was well worth the wait. The hype is worth it. I am giving 5 stars because I think you won't find anything like RBC in Chicago. The beers are great - I had the Iron Fist Pale Ale - slightly hoppy with a smooth finish. I also tried the Bottom Up Belgian Wit - Amy our bartender is right, it's not your typical girlie Belgian beer. We also bought the Mug Club - for the free growler and other elitist benefits. For food, we had the bacon fat popcorn (minus the cheese, due to Lenten rituals). Yummy. I had the Iron Fist Fish and Chips for my main course and the SO had the Workingman Burger (sans cheese). We both went home satisfied. I am super excited to try their vegetarian meals, especially the Tempeh Ruben. RBC is a must. Service is fantastic. Atmosphere is inviting. Definitely an asset to Logan Square.
