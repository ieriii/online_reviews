This place is both delicious and well priced. After eating a bunch of great Cuban food in Miami and getting totally hooked, I was really happy to find such good food at 90 Miles. It's about as good as you can get up here! I highly recommend the empanadas (beef, in particular), the Cubano sandwich, and the ropa vieja. The yuca fries that come with sandwiches are great, and the plantains that come with dinners looked really good too. Everything also seemed pretty authentic and portions were generous. I'll definitely be back to try more, especially since it's right down the street from my house. It's also BYOB, which is nice, and the heated patio seating is great.
