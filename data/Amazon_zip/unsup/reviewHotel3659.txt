I had high tea with a group of girlfriends today. We were all extremely pleased with the service, food, tea, and atmosphere! The tea was very yummy. We devoured our tea sandwiches and our waiter brought us another plate! The scones, bread and petit fours were very tasty as well. There is also great people watching here!
