The atmosphere is upbeat and restaurant is well designed. The main dining area is two stories tall and overlooks Grant Park through giant windows. Although its is part of the recently restored Blackstone Hotel, it is built out in a modern and simplistic fashion and has an open kitchen as well. Service was great for the most part. Our waiter was just ok; I had to ask about the specials and he took an eternity to bring the desert menus and our check. That being said, the food came out promptly, dishes were warm when they were supposed to be, and not all at one time (which can be a problem with tapas). The menu is not as expansive as some other tapas restaurants, but they more than made up for it with the high quality ingredients and unique dishes. Tip: try the Serrano Ham and Fig Salad
