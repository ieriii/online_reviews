I went on a Monday morning with my family. Luckily there was a short wait. The place is a lot bigger than I had expected (we were so used to going to hole-in-the-walls). The server was okay but at least he was attentive. The portions are huge! That's coming from a family that can eat. Luckily almost all of us split dishes. The strawberry orange juice is delicious! Order it! The coffee is on the stronger side, and they were good about keeping it filled. 1) Huevos Rancheros (over-easy eggs with chorizo, salsa, and cheese over corn tortillas. Served with sour cream, red diced potatoes or fresh fruit) 2) Santa Fe Frittata (bacon, avocado, three cheeses scrambled with jalapenos, green onions, and grilled red diced potatoes) 3) Sliced avocado and mushrooms blended with scrambled eggs and melted cheddar & jack cheeses, then folded in to two sweet crepes. - Loved it! Sweet yet savory. Everyone enjoyed their food. The food was good, classical breakfast.
