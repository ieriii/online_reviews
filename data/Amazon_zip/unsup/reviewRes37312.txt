As a devotee of another beer-bar down in Bucktown, I took my time heading north to try out Hopleaf. Sure, I'd heard wonderful things, but... but yeah, I'm stubborn. And stupid, apparently, as this bar completely delivers on all the promises made to me by other enamored patrons. Hopleaf has, as I'm sure you know by now, a fantastic beer selection. More importantly, though, they have wonderful bartenders who are very knowledgeable in the ways of beer and can guide you should the menu be overwhelming. Even if you feel yourself to be a seasoned beer drinker, let them help you find your new favorite. In addition to a fabulous beer selection, Hopleaf has wonderful food. I had the CB&J - cashew butter, fig jam, and cheese pan-fried to a crusty deliciousness. Sounds a little odd, but just try it - you'll like it. Whatever you do, get the fries, they are perfection. Only small complaint would be the noise level here on weekends. I know, lame, but the brick walls do little to absorb the sound and you end up yelling at your drinking buddies.
