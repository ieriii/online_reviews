I had eaten here before for dinner, not a fan. Today went here for brunch. Pretty darn good. I have always been a fan of the decor. Dark and regal looking. But the dinner menu was not that impressive. Brunch menu today very good, nice variety and everyone in our party was happy. Now fix your dinner menu!
