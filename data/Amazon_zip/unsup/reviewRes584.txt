soooooo...overall this was a very different and fun experience. all in all, my husband and i decided that it ranks third on our fanciest of fancy dinner list. first is eleven madison park in NYC, second is the french laundry in Yountville, and then Alinea.  all the really little bites were great...the big ones, were just ok. the wine parings were just too safe. i mean they were great...just a little on the safe side. caramel powder was really cool, as was the truffle explosion and the hot/cold potato. they sat us in the kiddie room! i believe i am the same age as the chef and even older than the wait staff. while my husband and i feel blessed to be youthful looking, we are tired of being treated like we don't know our fancy dinner shit just because we look young. when we walked in the door the two ladies took my coat, whispered to each other and then put us in the kiddie room. booo door ladies! i would have given them 4 stars, but this action is a no no in customer service. and it's a shame, because it took me a while to get over this and this paragraph is longer than the one that described the food! if you have the money, go for it, but if you don't have gray hair and are naturally young looking because you inherited great genes, be prepared to feel insulted by the door ladies.
