I took my lady to Hotel Allegro for a "staycation" here in Chicago, and we had such a great time! The room was small, but it was so wonderfully decorated and hip, that it didn't even matter. The staff were all very friendly with good senses of humor, and we loved the free wine hour and free hot cocoa/coffee (I recommend half of each to get a mocha going). : ) I stayed at a 4 and 1/2 star hotel a month later and didn't have nearly as good of an experience as I did at Allegro.  It's a really good spot in every respect.
