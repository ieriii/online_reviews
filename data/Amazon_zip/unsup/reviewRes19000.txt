We made a reservation for 6 on a Friday night and as soon as we got to this crowded hotspot we were seated. Service was a little slow at the beginning while we waited on drinks, but after that things were great. A group of friends and I split the poutine, the cheese board and the fried zucchini and olives. The poutine was delicious though I think we could have passed by the average cheese plate and fried veggies. For my entree I ordered the fish and chips. Cleverly served in newspaper, these were very good. The portion was, large and the fries were very crisp and salty. They were served with tartar sauce, ketchup and malt vinegar. Overall, I enjoyed the atmosphere at the Gage and thought the prices were pretty reasonable seeing as its in a pretty touristy area. I would love to try some more unique items on the menu!
