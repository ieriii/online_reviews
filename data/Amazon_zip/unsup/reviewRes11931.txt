Not being our type of crowd, we ordered thin crust pepperoni to be delivered on two occasions. It tastes all right, but man, that crust is sooooooo chewy. Like to the point where it got hard to eat it and my jaw hurt. And my jaw ached the next day from trying to chew that sheet rubber. Maybe it's better when you eat it there, though I don't think you'll find us there any day soon testing it out.
