ok, this place is HOT... a very, very SPECIAL place indeed... i read some of these other reviews and i HAD to laugh... quite a few were negative... i guess i should not be surprised... because you have to ESCAPE the baseball hats and khaki shorts and flip flops to ENTER this PLACE and then you are sent back to them when you leave... this place is a DESIGN DREAM, super cool, super lovely... a place to spend some special time with some special people... the drinks are impeccable... and, much to my SHOCK, so was the food... it is NOT a restaurant, by any means... but the "duck meatballs" were an appetizer-lover's DREAM COME TRUE... if you are "put off" by STYLE, CONFIDENCE, FASHION and (up-to-the-minute) DESIGN sensibility... DO NOT COME HERE!!!! i will be DELIGHTED to NOT see you there... oh and one more thing... our cocktail waitress, LAURA... cool, calm, fun, effiicent... a PLEASURE!!!!! can't wait to return!!!
