Come here prepared to eat until it hurts. We refer to this as the meat sweats, where you are just too uncomfortable to do anything once you've finished eating here. I love Brazilian steakhouses so I've been to them all and I would say this one is good, but others nearby are better. Start with the harvest table which has a very good selection, but in comparison to some of their competitors they are missing a few of my favorites like the risotto and sushi. The gauchos come around with all the variety of meats, but I wish they had shrimp or grilled pineapple like they have at Brazzas. All of the meats are extremely salty so you may run into the problem we had and that was ordering rounds of drinks every time the server came around. Before we knew it, we had racked up a $300 drink bill. Maybe that's why they make everything so salty, so you'll get thirsty and order the recommended drinks without seeing the prices because they are definitely not listed on the menu. I did think it was cool that they make your drinks at the table on a moving bar. We had the caparahnas and they were spectacular.
