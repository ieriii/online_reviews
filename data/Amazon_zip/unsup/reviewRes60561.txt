GREAT PLACE TO TAKE out of towners visiting Chicago. Great decor, prices aren't too bad (10-11-12-13$ for a dinner entree). They will be impressed. Good service, very busy, excellent, REAL food you can tell they prepared in the kitchen. Very satisfying! I live in Chicago and sometimes go here during the week for late dinners around 9pm when it's not so crowded. Devil's chicken, Italian Market Sandwich, Carolina BBQ Pork Sandwich, Pot Roast I've all had and are excellent.
