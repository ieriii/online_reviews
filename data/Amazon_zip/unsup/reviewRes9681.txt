I took the reviews from all the Yelpers and they did not fail. We had a wonderful evening at Le Colonial with my wife and two kids. Between us we had a lot of the menu adn it was all good. The Boulliabaisse was exceptional as was the Pho. Nice service and will definitely visit on our next trip to Chicago.
