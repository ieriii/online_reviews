I had a huge cafe con leche craving and this place hit the spot! Came here last Friday for some cuban fare with a group of girlfriends. We only had 5 ppl so couldn't make reservations (8 required), but I was able to snag a table by coming in around 7ish instead of waiting until 8pm. Definitely a good call on my part because the people rolled in deep after that. They have a pretty extensive menu and I wanted to try everything! Alas, I can only EAT SO MUCH. Had the chimichurri steak sandwich which was delicious. Shared a ropa vieja and the meat was very well seasoned, rice was fluffy and soft, and plantains were super delish. Split empanadas among our table: goat cheese and beef, pretty standard, weren't bad at all. Got a taste of their guanabanana (sp?) smoothie and passion fruit iced tea. Both not too sweet, but not too bland. Just right. The icing on the cake was my cafe con leche. I savored that before the dinner and it totally reminded me of the first time I had cafe con leche in miami. Next time, I'm going to try to snag a seat outside cause those seem to go first. And of course remember to BYOB!
