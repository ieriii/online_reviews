Breakfast here is decent. My friend and I both ordered versions of Eggs Benedict: she had the traditional and I got the South of the Border Benny which really just meant they substituted the canadian bacon with chorizo. Good but not amazing. The strawberry OJ was great so I recommend that. I hear one of their best dishes is the blackberry-banana pancakes so I'll have to try that the next time I visit. Gets pretty busy on weekends so get there early or be prepared to wait a bit. Nice staff.
