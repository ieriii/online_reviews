Like meat? You must try this place. If you are looking for something different (and better!) then Fogo, Texas de Brazil, or Brazzaz, this place is a must. Seasonal menu , seafood selections, and a tasty array of salad / charcuterie items that will amaze and delight. Favorites included the 5 spice pork belly and salmon. Our server Ish, was dynamite- he gave us excellent wine choices and helped to make dinner experience elevated to even greater heights!
