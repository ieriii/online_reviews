This is one of my favorite Thai/Japanese places. Plus, I'm a fan of any place that delivers. The rama chicken, the musuman curry, and the sweet potato maki are unbelievable!!!! Oh! Don't forget the crab rangoon...little fried purses full of cream cheese & crab awesomeness. Beware, though..sometimes the rice dishes taste a little smokey. I've had that happen with both the rama chicken and the orange chicken. Strange...
