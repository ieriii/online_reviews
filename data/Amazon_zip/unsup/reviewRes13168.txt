We were in town for a conference and decided to try this place, since I love Brazilian steakhouses. I have been to a few in Los Angeles, but Texas de Brazil beats them by a long shot. First off the service was great, our waitress Leah was very friendly and courteous and the meat servers were immediately at your table as soon as you flipped the circle thing to green. Now to the most important part. The food was astonishing. The quality of the meat was great and there was a large variety of meats including beef, chicken and pork. As for the salad bar. It is the largest salad bar I have seen at a Brazilian steakhouse and it's not just salads, there was shrimp, sushi and other interesting items. If you want wine, there is an aerial artist that will go up the 40 foot wine tower while doing acrobatics. The bottom line is, this place is worth every penny. Great food, great service. You will not go home hungry. Check out the virtual tour on their site to see the interior. Beautiful place.
