This is terrible!How do you take that star back?!Delivery service is lax!I ordered one medium deep dish pizza for delivery next door to the hospital and from the start I knew I should have not even ordered. It took the person who answered the phone 15 min just to figure out how to spell my name and figure out that I was next door. My name has 8 letters 4 in the first and 4 in the last, not hard at all. When I ordered my one medium deep dish pizza they estimated my time at 1 hr and 15 min! Rediculous. Even worse it showed up a half hr after that and when I finally got it, it look like grease soup and tasted just the same. Oh and it came out to 30 bucks because their prices are "so reasonable". When I called I did get a different comped order but I had to make it up because the nonlinear menu was no good. In fact they had the nerve to tell me the pizza I did order was discontinued, and no longer on the menu but yet they let me order it, made it and brought it too me. When asked if I wanted to order again I was hesitant but for the sake of time just ordered a regular pizza and pop, that was clearly less than the first and they say "this ones on gino" as if they were doing me a favor. That was 45 min ago. They don't know but I'm the doorman at a 5 star hotel downtown that regularly sends guests there. Needless to say that wont happen anymore!Good job guysI know my one service isn't gonna phase your day but maybe you can get your employees and website on the same page. Or just get someone who can make a pizza in there.
