am I the only one not in love with deep dish pizza? It was good here but it is such a tourist trap. I love me some pizza but the toppings and sauce were meh. I rather have a brick oven pizza! Either way if you are looking to try deep dish pizza, this isn't bad. They have multiple locations and they have a vegetarian option as well.
