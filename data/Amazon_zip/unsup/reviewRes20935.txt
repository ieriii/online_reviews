This was yet another stop on our trip... we had to have the Churros and Hot Chocolate. It was good. The line was Breakfast Klub long! (Houston -you know what I mean.) We grabbed ours to go. We enjoyed them, but not exactly the WOW experience I had heard about. Glad I tried it, not sure it will make the list for our next trip. :)
