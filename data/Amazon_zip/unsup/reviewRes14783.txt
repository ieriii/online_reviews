(I would like to give it 3.5 stars, but since I can't I think I should edge toward the lower side with 3.) I love beer and was really happy to see Revolution opening up real close to me. I've been twice now since it opened, once just for beer and once for beer + food. If you're a beer lover, the in house brews are nothing to rave about. The Golden Ale, for instance, starts out well, it's smooth and sweet, but it don't finish with any sort of complexity. When you breath the after taste, it isn't bad, it just isn't really there at all. The IPA isn't particularly hoppy (if you like that) and the hops it does have doesn't have much depth to it. It's not very bright or evoke any citrus flavors. I had dark beer too, which I haven't seen on the menu again, but it was pretty good until a friend pointed out that it tasted like a Band-Aid. He was absolutely right. I couldn't drink anymore. The only thing I've eaten there is the burger, which was solid. Good flavor, very juice (almost too juicy), crisp bacon, fresh lettuce and tomato, and put on a substantial and durable bun that was tasty itself. I had the mashed potatoes with it, which were smooth and creamy with a touch of sour--good, but nothing to rave about--as the bar tender did. I would recommend Revolution as a good place to hang out and get a drink, BUT it's really too crowded at this point.  I think the reason for that is mainly that this area of Chicago is desperate for a brewery and even an OK one is something to flock to.  If it were better I would say it might be worth the wait (which was 30mins at 5:45pm on a Friday) for a table or a slot at the bar. But it's not. I say, wait until it has calmed down a bit and then head over to Revolution and try it out. No rush. Maybe in a couple months the brew master will have perfected a few beers.
