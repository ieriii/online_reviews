Good seasoning, but the chicken was overcooked. We ordered the combo - half Plain Jane and half Seoul Sassy. All of the pieces including the dark meat were way overcooked. Based on other reviews I'm hoping this was just an off night, but I just could not get over the fact that the meat was extremely dry and hard. For the price ($19.99 for a whole chicken, two sides, and two drinks) I'd much rather go to Popeyes and pick up a family meal.
