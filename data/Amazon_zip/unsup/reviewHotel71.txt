I'd love to give this 2.5 stars if I could. I decided to come here because the overall reviews looked good and the price was great. (I was there for business, didn't want to stay at the airport and downtown Chicago didn't make sense) Its true it looks recently renovated, the lobby area is pretty ritzy looking, and the restaurant seemed to have a lot of business. I stayed in the motor inn section. The sheets & towels were worn & tired. The place just didn't look sparkling. There was a towel in the bathroom hung like maybe the maid had not seen it from the last guest. The tile was a bit scuffed. The bathroom could have used a fan, a new door, and a light in the shower. This will do since this is a business trip, but I kind of wish I were somewhere else... http://www.carletonhotel
