I've lived down the street for two years now, passed this place many times and went in for the first time yesterday with friends thinking it would be slow on a Monday night, wrong! We arrived put our name on a list and told we'd be waiting about 10 min. to sit.  Well, we finally took our seats after waiting ravenously hungry aprox 30 min for our table. For starters, killer beer menu and our waiter was great, he pretty much picked out our meals for us from the beer on up to our dinners. The food was pie in the sky phenomenal- it just takes a long time to get it, a really long time. Fortunatelly our waiter was around plenty to bring us drinks, which were the only thing during our visit that arrived quickly and consistantly.For two salads a soup and a calamari we waited 25 minutes, our dinners arrived another 30 min after the appetizers, The food was delicious the Baramundi and the Arctic Char were both out of this world.  At one point the manager stopped by and apologized for our wait, explaining the kitchen had recieved a lot of food orders all at the same time, Apology accepted I'll be back.  Definitely a great place to eat, just be ready to wait and wait and wait
