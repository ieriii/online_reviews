I had high expectations because of the high reviews and also a recommendation. We had the 10 course tasting menu at $125 and though it was plenty of food, I felt like the dishes were not thought out as creatively as they should have been.  The flavors weren't out of the ordinary and the most creative dish was probably the caesar salad with anchovy. I would opt for one of the other hundreds of tasting menus chicago has to offer.
