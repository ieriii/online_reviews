This was my second or third time at Bongo Room and I have to say this place is amazing. The service has always been amazing and wonderful, the coffee is delicious, and the food is beyond words! I ordered the french toast with dried cherries and vanilla sauce and I am not kidding it was the most amazing thing I have ever eaten!!! EVER!! The service is great. Granted you have to wait a little bit but it is WELL WORTH the wait! Well worth it!!! My rating of Bongo Room is above five starts because everything is beyond great :) For those of you who complained about not being served a mimosa or some iced tea. GET SOME PERSPECTIVE.... If you are going to give one star based on not getting some champagne or some flavored water then you need to go elsewhere and stop complaining about every little thing in life. If you don't like waiting.... Go somewhere else like IHOP or Denny's where I am sure they are never shot staffed on a table or some powdered iced tea.  SOOO sorry Bongo Room brews their iced tea fresh therefore may run out.... Bongo Room is a must if you like great service, amazing food, and very tasty coffee :) LOVE LOVE LOVE Bongo Room!
