Ok it gets crowded. And yeah the service can be slow. Oh but check out that beer selection! Confession: I used to live a few blocks away and it is by far the best late-night food option on that stretch of Clark St. The mussels are fantastic and they come with frites, aioli, and a hunk of bread. And if the pan-seared pork chops with brussel sprouts ever appears on the menu - get it. The Flemish Stew kicks butt too. *Drool*
