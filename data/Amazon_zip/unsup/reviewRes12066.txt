Some amazing pizza for not much money -- I think each of us spent $5 for a large with two toppings. And emphasis on LARGE -- it comes out on a gigantic cookie-type tray, and you look at it and wonder how half of it will be eaten. Unfortunately for leftover-fan me, my buddies ate it all, save for one lone piece (get it, Piece....). BUT... the service sucked. Pretty horrible. This woman who "served" us must've been having a bad day or something (my friend's exact words: "dude, relax, she must be on her period"). But really, she forgot stuff we requested; she made no eye contact and almost whispered; and, probably beyond her control, we waited like 10 minutes after being seated before giving our drink orders, and probably another 10 minutes after that to give our pizza order. But whatever, I gave her 20 pct in hopes that if -- no, when -- I do come back, it'll be a bit better. N.B. Unless you call for reservations (which I believe you can do), you'll wait a while before getting a seat, as we learned when we just walked in on a random Saturday afternoon. But perhaps these crowds know something you, too, should come to know.......
