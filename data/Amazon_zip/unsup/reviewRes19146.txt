I've been to Bad Apple a couple times now and each time I go I get a little more addicted to it. The staff are all super friendly and always ready with drink recommendations when you sit down. The beer menu is fantastic! The list is long and has great descriptions. The prices are a little high on some of the beers but I don't mind so long as they can keep all of them in stock on a regular basis. So far I've been impressed with the food there too. I had the Rosemary's Chicken with fries and it was super delicious. The pulled chicken was marinated to perfection. The red onions and arugala were sauteed to perfection too. If there was one downside to the meal it was my fries. They had way too much salt on them for some reason. I had the fries before and they were perfect so I'm just going to assume the salt shaker got away from the cook. I'll definitely be going to back to Bad Apple again and again.
