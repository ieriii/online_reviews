BEST DEEP DISH PIZZA IN ALL OF CHICAGO! Yep, I said it and you CANNOT, WILL NOT convince me of otherwise. I don't mind the wait because it's THAT delicious. I love the caramelized cheese crust the best! The sauce is delicious and the variety of toppings are endless. It's just plain orgasmic. They have a great selection of quality beers on tap also, as well as, some tasty apps. My mouth is watering just thinking about it. I take all my visitors there when they say that want Chicago deep dish, and anytime I am in the mood for deep dish pizza, I look nowhere else, but here.
