I love Frontera. I think the food is great, and as far as I can tell, Bayless knows his stuff.  I have no patience for anyone who complains about the reservation system, because as I understand it, it keeps the place from becoming super-exclusive. No one gets preferential treatment because of a name, because no one can make a reservation. And if you really have a problem with it, find four other people, and make a reservation for five. It's what I've done 99% of the time, and the experience has been stellar each of those times. Furthermore, I can't understand why anyone would complain about price. THIS is what fine dining is. Food is more expensive, and if you don't like it, don't eat here. In my experience, you pay for what you get. Tonight, my duck breast was perfectly cooked, and duck is very hard to do perfectly, and I understand that in order to experience this, I had to pay for it. It's not hard to suss out restaurant information these days--do some homework before you go, so you won't be shocked at the wait, or so you won't bug out over the prices. Anyway, I like the food. The desserts tonight weren't great, but I've had great desserts on other occasions. The appetizer platter didn't fail to delight (again!), and as I said, my duck entree was fantastic. I'd highly recommend a side order of mashed potatoes to everyone, because they're just delicious. (So are the black beans; if your dish doesn't come with those, try those as well.) Everyone at the table seemed to like their food; my boyfriend said his carne asada was the best he's ever had it at Frontera. I've never had a less-than experience here, even the time I waited for a table for two hours (we ordered appetizers at the bar, had some drinks, and just waited. It worked for us. But we also knew what we were getting into.). This is one of the most famous restaurants in Chicago, and by my estimation, that title is well-deserved.
