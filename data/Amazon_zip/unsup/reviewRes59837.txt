Unfortunately for our holiday party, we were not even able to get to try the food. After making a reservation a week in advance for our holiday party, we received a call an HOUR before our reservation saying that there would be a staff training meeting during our reservation and we would be the only people in the restaurant eating while they were training the staff. All the while I was on the phone with Ryan, he kept trying to convince me that because he told me this, I should be ok with eating while they are conducting a training meeting. Thank you, Ryan. Why were we not informed when we made the reservation? Why were we not informed when we called to confirm the morning of the reservation? Why were we called ONE HOUR before we were to be seated???Susan doesn't run her restaurants like this. Poor taste in our mouths!
