Maybe I'm just super clumsy, but half of my night was spent digging in hot oil looking for my scallops and veggies! I had a great time here despite it all. The food was really good, and the prices were reasonable for a romantic fondue place. (Better than Melting Pot prices...) The lights were a little too low which forced me to squint and place my menu literally next to my romantic candle. Fire hazard! And not the only fire hazard that I had that night! I'm dangerous with a fondue stick! Anyway the dinner meals all come with cheese fondue, salad, a main course with veggies and chocolate fondue for dessert. The main course comes with a number of dipping sauces, most of which were good (bbq tasted like it was out of a jar though). I came with my bf for our anniversary; we both had the chicken and scallops. I think it was about $35 each plus our bottle of Chianti which was decently priced for overpriced restaurant bottle prices (and plus tax/tip)... all and all decent prices for the atmosphere and food, but I don't know.... I didn't pay... anniversary :) I would recommend Geja's for a unique dining experience for a special occasion or just a fun time. The dress ranged from casual to dressy (and it was too dark to really tell what anyone was wearing!) And for me... the fondue handling provided some memorable moments!
