Starting my first day of the 21-Day Vegan Challenge surrounded by New Years Day brunches?? Seriously, what a day to start. But alas, Fox and Obel came through. Based off of my previous visit and review, they've reduced their prices on many items, but kept their customer service top notch. I had a large coffee with soy and a nice bowl of steel cut oats with 'nanners. They opened a previously closed cafe area in front of the market (eat here and enjoy the river views!). Worth checking out. (FYI- January 8th-10th 2010, they will be having a Market-wide sale: 20% off all market-only purchases that you can fit in the provided bag. )I will be there!!
