I will COME BACK every time I go to Chicago. I met some friends for brunch on a recent trip and we had..... Excellent service Excellent food Delicious drinks Good weather (ok they can't claim it, but it helped the experience, it WAS October in Chicago for goodness' sake) Great atmosphere... We sat outside, but the inside of their restaurant/bar is just gorgeous, dark woods, clean spaces and lines, open tall ceilings The list of bourbons was so incredibly long and impressive...it made me want to try a few but it was before noon on a Saturday soooooo even I have my limits. :)
