If G-d forbid you are searching Yelp right now in prison, trying to figure out where to get your "last meal," I HIGHLY suggest Gino's East!!! I am a Chicago native. I know pizza. It runs through my veins. (Actually, it probably doesn't run through my veins thanks to likely life-threatenng arterial build-up from all that cheese.) Gino's corn meal/egg crust - that's what does it for me. I also love the tomatoes, the sauce and the gooey... stringy... hot... delicious... cheese. Wow, I'm suddenly getting very worked up over here. Yes, there are many "Chicago style pizza" places... and everyone has their favorite. But this is a CLASSIC restaurant that has been around forever. And if you live out of town... they deliver their pizza anywhere in the country. I've done this and it was worth every penny. Although, the delivery guy was quite exhausted when he finally got to my door!
