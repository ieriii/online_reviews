The atmposphere was nice. I went here a month ago and I enjoyed everything. The server was very nice and understood that I wanted to be away in a secluded section with my partner. The food was good. I personally enjoyed the Baked Clams and had to order a 2nd one to go. I ended up getting the Sausage pizza and the found the cheese to be a bit greasy, but that is what I always experience from places that serve pizzas.Overall, had a great experience and will definitely be back. Maybe for Valentine's day
