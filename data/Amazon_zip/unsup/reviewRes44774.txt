This is the best pizza east of the mississippi(ny sucks), and the second best pizza i have eaten in my entire life. We randomly found this place while wandering around in Chicago late at night, the inside is really nice, the decor is excellent. We of course got the deep dish, some morons who reviewed it who had never been there tried something else. STUPID. The pizza was damn good, the crust was weird but deep dish pizza crust is different. The cheese was excellent, tons of toppings, and the sauce was fantastic. If you're in Chicago visiting, go there for pizza. It's right across millenium park and close to the lake. This pizza is so good i'd fly to chicago again just to eat it. Great city, GREAT pizza.
