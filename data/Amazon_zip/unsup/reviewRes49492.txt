Nice restaurant with good wine selections. It's good for late-night dinner with a big group (in the Tavern dining area) - less crowded and you can sample their "flights" of wine without getting (too) wasted. Prices on the wine list are pretty reasonable. Food can be a bit pricy, but quality isn't bad. The cheese list is pretty decent too. After trying out four flights (each flight = four glasses), we decided to buy two bottles from their bins. Surprisingly those aren't expensive at all, e.g., the tasty Pomelo Sauvignon Blanc is only $12.95.
