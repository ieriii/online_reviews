Well I really want to love this place but unfortunately I only like it. They were super slammed on a Thursday, which is good for them, not so much for me. Bartenders ignored us for about 15 mins but made it up by give us the first round on him. Bruschetta was to die for! We tried all 4 and they were insanely delicious. Chicken wings were very yummy too with a little kick of spicy. We both had burgers and both wanted them medium. I had the forest burger and they over cooked it, it was well, well done! My friend had the farm burger and it was medium rare. We didn't complain for fear of never getting our food and/or having it spat in! Beer was ehh, ok. I had a working man and a bottom wit. Bottom wit was very similar to a blue moon. Workingman was similar to a pale ale sierra Nevada. But wasn't nearly as tasty as either of them. I will try this place again, possibly for lunch on an off day, but won't be back for drinks or dinner.
