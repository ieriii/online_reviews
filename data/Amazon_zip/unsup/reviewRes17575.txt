Solid. Solid. Solid. This place is everything a lounge should be: cutting edge, dark, ambient, dynamic, consistent GOOD FOOD, GOOD DRINKS, GOOD MUSIC, cool ass bartender(s) (shout out to Michael -- a proud self-proclaimed NYC transplant who made GREAT drinks with such passion. I mean, this guy LOVES what he does. And took the time to use his knowledge of rare and hard to find drinks as small talk fused with humor with his patrons.) Walking in, you're kinda temporarily blinded by the sudden darkness, and tall drooping drapes that hang from ceiling to floor. Then you get to the first part of the lounge which has these slim highback chairs that i'm sure were custom made. Then the second part is seperated by more floor to ceiling drapes as the bar to the right continues into that room also. Here you get cozy booths for that intimate aura, feel, mystique. Then the 3rd part which seems a bit more expansive and fit for private parties, which also continues in the tradition of the first 2 rooms in terms of decor and ambience. The entire lounge is meshed perfectly with traditional and mod touches. The crown moldings, the old 19th century restroom doors that are complimented with fine stainless steel futuristic faucets and funky shaped sinks. They were CLEAN. These guys have set a standard in new age loungematics. ha! I think its safe to say that there's no free standing lounge in Chicago like this - (that isn't attached to a 5 Star hotel). I'm waiting to see who will step up and leap over this bar that violet hour has set. You definitely have to check it out.
