This is a fun, neighborhood place which my friend took me to recently. We got there about 5:45 and it was full by 6:00. It had a great selection of springs rolls (we had shrimp) and everything was reasonably priced. I had the Simply It steak dish which was awesome and my friend is a regular and loves everything, frequently getting takeout. Its an inexpensive place with fresh ingredients and definitely worth checking out!
