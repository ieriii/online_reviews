Purple Pig was very good! The ambience is cool, but its always packed! I went on a Thursday around 530pm and it was just beginning to get really packed. They say its European food served in tapas style. That was cool cause what i like about that is that we try so many different dishes. Everything was pretty good. The things I can say you should try are the pork shoulder its so tender and its covered in a tasty gravy sauce. They also serve a bruschetta type of plate i think it starts off with something called mordetta which i believe is some kind of cheese. Everything we had was pretty good. Sometimes I go to these new restaurants and don't really know how i feel about them, but what I can tell is whether their ingredients are fresh and prepared to order. These were all very fresh ingredients and nothing chewy or anything that I had to take out of my mouth and put at the side of my plate!! hahah. I'll definitely go b ack to try different things here. ALSO its not really even that expensive for a place on Michigan Ave. I spent $70 for 4 beers and like 6 dishes! plus tip of course.
