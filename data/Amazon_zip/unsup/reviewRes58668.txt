So this review is long over due but this place was the worst!!!!! the perverted owner practicaly molested my gf....very touchy feelly kinda old euro guy....the place was empty as always when i drive by and we had wanted to check it out for some time....the food was nothing speical i felt like my meal was under cooked and most of all like i mentioned the owner was over the top bad....after he offered my gf & me a shot in some clear white tube and while she was drinking it he kepted saying..suck it yeah ...suck it..ha i was like man should i punch this guy in the face......anyway we wanted to try something new in the area and we were very much dissapointed... i say NO to little bucharest bistro...also they could use some extra lght blubs in that place i felt like i was in dracula's lair.....come on man.
