My friend Nick brought me to Sun Wah while I was visiting him last fall, explaining that we would be having Peking roasted duck, served three ways, upon arriving. I had heard of such duck, and was intrigued, excited, like a school boy on the eve of his first make out session. Let me explain that this was one of the best meals I've had in a long time. The duck was succulent and juicy, with crispy, salty skin - the kind of duck and associated careful preparation and carving that makes you want to get on your knees and thank God that ducks were invented. The bao was fresh, soft and slightly sweet, coming with a variety of tasty sauces and trimmings that added to my extreme delight. A reviewer below claimed that the fried rice, made from some of the table-side carved duck, was merely fried rice. The problem with this negative claim is that so many places mess up fried rice...too greasy, too salty, too this or that let's say. Our fried rice was perfect in all respects - some of the best I've had. The soup was rich and delicious, piping hot, and not overly seasoned - a nice addition to the bao and rice. The ginger ice cream was a great surprise - sweet, not too much so, with the bite that only fresh ginger can deliver. Our service was prompt, friendly..and honestly, given what they were feeding me for the more than reasonable price in this expensive town, I wanted to hug everyone in the place. My buddy was making fun of me for being so nice to everyone. I will visit Sun Wah upon my return, and again and again. Go to this place, and nevermind the negative reviews. I have a feeling that the people who wrote them are mean to old ladies and curse at puppies a lot. Peace out..
