Finally went to Hot Dougs after months of anticipation and a drive-by a few weeks ago when we decided the line was too long and we were too hungry to wait. Went this past Sat, showed up at 11:30am and the line was twice as long as what we had previously witnessed! Nevertheless, we were determined to stick it out. It was exactly 2 hours from the time we got in line to the time the dogs were in my mouth. 2 HOURS!!! I wouldn't wait that long for anything else (like a burger at Kuma's) but Dougs Dogs are unique, hence worth the wait for this experience. We had the rattlesnake dog (FAVE), foie gras/duck sausage dog (WORST, almost wanted to spit it out!), smoked debreziner (small red sausage that was really tasty with the toppings) and a corndog (best i ever had). Also the much acclaimed duck fat fries which were 100% disappointing! DO NOT waste your time in line on a Fri/Sat just to try these fries, it is NOT worth it! McDonalds has better fries! Seriously, they weren't even salty and had no flavor, they were just maybe a little crispier than other fries. Nothing special at all. However, I didn't want to waste stomach space on fries anyway since we had 4 dogs between 2 people, so I was fine without them!! Hard to choose from all the specialty dogs, wanted to try them all. If I ever go again, will go with a larger group so can sample more dogs. I doubt I'll make it to Hot Dougs more than once a year just cuz of the crazy wait involved, but it is definitely worth going to check it out even just once. PS: they ONLY ACCEPT CASH. i don't know if this is common knowledge, but i surely didn't know...good thing my bf always has cash on hand! There is no ATM around so you'd be screwed after waiting in line for hours if you weren't prepared.
