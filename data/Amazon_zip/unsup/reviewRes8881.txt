Possibly the worst 'brick oven-baked pizza.' While it's lightning fast in getting your order, the crust itself is ridiculously soggy and the ingredients is not that impressive. I had their Salsiccia, which had tomatoes, fior di latte mozzerella, chunks of basil, italian sausage (this was fine), and olive oil. My cousin had their Salsiccia e Broccoletti, which was a pizza bianca with italian sausage, rapini, fior di latte mozzerella, and olive oil. Let me tell you - their rapini is the broccoli raab, and it's quite bitter bitter bitter! It literally ruined the whole taste of the pizza, and you can't get that bitterness out. Yuck. Their 'Italian Sodas' are basically what you can buy at Whole Foods - San Pellegrino sodas in their 3 flavors. Parking can be somewhat of a pain, depending on what time of day and day of the week you go.
