With 200 + reviews, there's no reason for me to write about how great the food was here, how fresh and homemade it tasted, and how nice the staff was. So I won't. I will, however, register my approval with a five star rating and a "six flags, more flags, more fun" comment, just to get my review count up. So, Six Flags, more flags more fun!
