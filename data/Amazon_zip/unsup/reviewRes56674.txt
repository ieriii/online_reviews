I totally loved this place! It's very cozy there, and pricing is reasonable (especially when we went for the Tuesday Tappa special). Each dish was about $5-$7, and the portion wasn't super small as we had originally expected. I personally really liked the ribs and the risotto, and the hazelnut panna cotta was awesome for finishing a lovely meal. I am definitely planning to go back for the Monday family special sometime.
