So my husband finally won out on convincing me to try this place out. It's not that I'm a huge meat eater because I'm not but I'm just not a fan of "replacement" food. Fake chicken, fake beef, fake whatever. Stuff like that there just gives me the willies. But it was a Sunday and on Sunday's I usually try and start eating healthier to make up for my Friday and Saturday feeding frenzy...so we ended up at Chicago Diner. I actually really liked the atmosphere and the staff. We were greeted with a big friendly smile and seated right away. The place just made me feel comfortable and relaxed...chill. I ordered the Huevos ala Mexicana...it was all real food products by the way. Mmm, eggs, avocado, salsa, beans...sigh. I actually forget what my husband ordered but I think I remember liking it. I was feeling pretty satisfied...almost full when our server came up and asked us if we wanted dessert? Whaaat? it's not even noon? We just had breakfast! Of course we don't want..."What do you guys have?" asked my breakfast partner/husband. Urgh. After dessert I literally waddled out of there and the pie was kick ass by the way. I don't remember what it was or what was in it but it must have been something illegal. Yep, I'll be back...hate when the husband is right.
