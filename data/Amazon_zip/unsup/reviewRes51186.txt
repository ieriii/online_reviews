I went for dinner here a second time a few Fridays ago at 8PM and the place was half full just like it was the previous time I went. The waiter recommended one of their signature drinks after I told him I wanted something similar to an old fashioned. It was ok but tasted mostly of lime juice so not what I expected. The cornbread they served with our crab cake appetizer was delicious and the best food of the night. The cakes were also good. For my entree I ordered the 'pan seared' halibut special which was disappointing. It was breaded and tasted like ordinary fish sticks served with melonball potatoes and ramps. Not what I was expecting and very average but definitely not worth $23, not even close. Our final bill was $75 before tip which was far too much for 2 mediocre entrees/2 mediocre drinks/1 good appetizer. There are just too many better options in the neighborhood for those prices. The staff is very friendly, but I can see why people aren't returning to the restaurant. The value just isn't there. I guess I could try their brunch, but I don't want to be disappointed a 3rd time.
