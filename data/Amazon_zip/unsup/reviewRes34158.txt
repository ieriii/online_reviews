I had come here about a year earlier, but had forgotten what i had in specifics. But I do recall it was good. So i got my chance at round two and boy, it was a fantastic experience. The waitstaff was very friendly and helpful. The wine pours were generous, plus the chianti I ordered was excellent. For the appetizers the calamari (which is hard to screw up) was very good, but the prosciutto was unbelievable. I would be content with just eating that all day. For dinner, my linguine with mussels and spicy marinara sauce was some of the finest pasta i've consumed in a while. Oh my. Can't wait to go back
