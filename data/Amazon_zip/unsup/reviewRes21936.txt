I just can't believe it, I wanted to like this place so much. We were excited about coming here and checking the place out. We had seen it on multiple tv shows and just knew that it was going to be awesome. Well, the actual experience of eating their food was not all that it was cracked up to be. There were three of us. Two got the superdawg and one got the chicken fingers, and we all got cokes to drink. The fries were over cooked (almost to the point of being burnt) and the hot dogs was "ok". Of course that was after I took off the pickle that had soaked the bun and made it soggy. The chicken fingers were over cooked and you know something's wrong when a 13 y/o teen boy won't eat all of their chicken fingers and fries. Oddly enough, the one thing I did think was really good - was the coke. It was a little sweeter than normaly coke, but not too sweet. The worst part of this visit? The price! I can't believe they charge $5.00 for a hot dog and a small handful of fries. If I want to pay for overpriced food, I'll go to my favorite cupcake place Sprinkles!
