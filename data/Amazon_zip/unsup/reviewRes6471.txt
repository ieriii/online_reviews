I almost hate to give this place another stellar review because the place is so busy as it is, but alas it does not disappoint. We had five people and did family style. The cost of the entrees to the portion size is deceiving (in a good way). You expect much less and get a lot more. The lamb and polenta special was excellent along with the carbonara risotto and the tuscan white bean bruschetta was really exceptional. Wine was very reasonably priced except they have a corkage charge for each bottle even when you purchase it there. Our server Erik was extremely knowledgeable and helpful. Except for when he changed my drink after I ordered, it the only problem being that I worked for a liquor distributer and know my drink and was not thrilled when he questioned my taste and knowledge of the liquors. That said it was a very minor blip on an extraordinary meal. Can't wait to come back.
