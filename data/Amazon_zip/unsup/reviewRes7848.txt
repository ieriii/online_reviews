Spacca Napoli is my go-to neighborhood restaurant. I've never had a bad meal here. If the burrata appetizer is on the menu, you MUST order it! The pizzas are amazing and are the closest thing to what you will find in Italy. The spicy Diavola is my favorite, but I also love the Funghi e Salsiccia. Note: They do not take to-go orders over the phone - you need to order in person. I'm pretty sure this is because the pizzas are ready so quickly and they want to make sure you get yours fresh out of the oven. Last time I ordered to-go they brought me a free glass of wine and my pizza was ready in no time.
