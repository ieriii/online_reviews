One of a kind Chicago bar! The atmosphere alone is reason enough to go! The bartender is amazing! She looks pissed off but is funny as hell and the perfect person to serve this crowd! I've never been for any night events but I often go in the afternoon when the locals take up the car stools and the jukebox plays old & scratchy jazz. The atmosphere is amazing. Original wall paintings...original booths and tables...lamps on the tables...rich & thick velvet curtains. If you're nice, they'll even let you look through the scrap book that they keep behind the bar. Complete with pics of Al Capone and his pals.
