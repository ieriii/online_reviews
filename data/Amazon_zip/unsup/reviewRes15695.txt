Service was good. Our waiter was attentive but not overly so. We were seated at a small 2 person table about 6 inches away from another couple and when I asked if we could be moved to a more private table, we were immediately moved to a 4 person table...much better! Drinks were fabulous. We had several coconut mojitos (our waiter said that Carnivale has won awards with their mojitos) and they were fantastic! We also had a tequila after dinner drink which was flavorful (recommended by our waiter). Appetizers were also great: we ordered the empanada and a trio of ceviches. Everyone of the ceviches were good (although the halibut was the best). Dinner was also tasty. My husband got the ribeye and I got the pork adobo. The portions were a good sized and the meat incredibly tender.
