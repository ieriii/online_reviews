Not A-OK but Just OK! I chose Wishbone for a Birthday lunch with my Aunt and Grandma and wish I had gone somewhere else. The dcor is great and the place is very large. The service was fast, polite, and very accommodating. The food however was the disappointment. The menu is very limited so if you're looking for something innovative and delicious look elsewhere. I had the Friday special, Java BBQ Chicken that was a bit of a let down. The Chicken was juicy but the sauce wasn't very unusual, even though it sounds like it should be. My Aunt had the Mango Chicken, which was a simple broiled chicken breast and a mango salsa on the side. I think the word she used to describe it was "Plain." I'd have to agree. My Grams had the Tuna Melt, which was simply "good." Which is how I would describe Wishbone in one word, not excellent, not great but just good.
