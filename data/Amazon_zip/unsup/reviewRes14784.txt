My first thought of Sabatino's was "My grandparents would love this place." Is that a good thing, well not necessarily. People love feeling like they're getting a lot. You get tons of food- a cup of soup and a salad is included. You get a loaf of crusty bread, then you get a pizza bread appetizer, which was bland and soggy and devoid of taste. The spinach egg soup tasted like something dug out of a garbage disposal and soaked in dish water. The salad was good, it had some darker greens in it. The pasta was pretty good, a lot of the food seems to me like something a nice Italian grandmother would cook for you if she wanted to fill you up. I have been here 4-5 times so I've gotten a good feel for it. I hear the lobster here is good, but lobster is probably good, period. At busier times like weekends, the service does suffer, and I would most definitely make a reservation. If you'd like to be stuffed full of "pretty good" Northern Italian food, in a dark, loud, crowded, and VERY dated atmosphere (the atmosphere is dreadful, dusty fake plants everywhere, waitresses ((yes, I'm pretty sure they're called that here)) wear nylons and old school uniforms...), then go here.
