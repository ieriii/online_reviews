Went on a Friday night and the front bar was crowded as heck, the dining area totally full but the upstairs bar thankfully pretty empty. We put our name in for three and waited upstairs but thankfully, considering how jam-packed the place was, we did not have to wait long. The upstairs bar is cash and bottles only, which was sort of a bummer, but no big deal. It is a little pricy but the food and beer is amazing. I ordered the Montreal-style Brisket sandwich which was absolutely delicious. I have never had such tender, succulent piece of brisket before, generously piled on sourdough with a spicy mustard to contrast. The fries and aoli mayo served on the side are perfect. I chose the Tripel Karmeliet as my beer to accompany my meal and it was marvelous. My friend ordered the Duck Ruben and a Delirium Tremens and loved it, while my other friend tried to go the cheaper and healthier route by ordering the Red Cabbage salad and side of fries, both of which she thoroughly enjoyed, and the cheapest beer in the bar which I cannot for the life of me remember the name of, but it was only 3.50. This restaurant is really lovely, the lighting and atmosphere perfect. We were lucky enough to be seated near their fireplace. Must go back to sample a different beer, there are so many to choose from it's hard to decide!
