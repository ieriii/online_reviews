This is my first 5 star review and I haven't been here in about 5 months. To me Frontera is like buying a pair of Tory Burch shoes--high quality expectations are met every time. I just know that over the years Frontera has never disappointed and my husband and I LOVE to come here for special occasions since it can be pricey and the wait can be long. While waiting, I love indulging with gold margaritas. But be careful, they are strong and I didn't remember my meal one time. Bayless is always walking around the restaurant which I think is so cool! Great specials and different dishes. I try something new every time and just love it. Frontera is certainly my restaurant crush if such thing exists.
