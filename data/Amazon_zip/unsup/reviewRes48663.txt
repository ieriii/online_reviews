When we got to The Publican it wasn't all that packed. We were also coming in later, though, so who knows how it was earlier. We stood at a highboy table while we waited to get seated and each ordered bloody marys and beer. The Publican Bloody Mary is made with homemade bitters, balsamic vinegar, chopped celery, Fresno chili, horseradish, regular tomato juice, and Titos vodka. It was delicious, although I thought it was a bit on the thick and chunky side. I needed a straw or something to drink it. A spoon! We had six people all together and when our party all arrived we were seated. Immediately we ordered pork rinds and bacon. Before trying them, I wasn't sure about the pork rinds, but they were so light and crispy. The bacon was delicious. Maple braised. The salty and sweet combination was fabulous. For our meals, this is what we got:  * Benton ham, red wine-poached egg, grilled bread and barnaise ($12)  * Weiswurst and pretzel ($10)  * Wood-fired egg with harissa, Gouda and grilled bread ($8)  * Pork confit, shrimp and andouille stew with scrambled eggs ($14)  * Smoked ham chop with Bird Mill grits and poached egg ($12) Everybody was really satisfied with their entrees. We were all so excited to be there and brunch at The Publican definitely did not let us down. I loved the ambiance inside. There's a lot of light wood and it was bright and sunny when we went. The lights weren't on, it was all ambient light and gorgeous. The service was spot on. My entree, the wood-fired eggs, was taking longer than everyone else's to come out of the kitchen, so they gave me a tomato & ricotta crustada on the house. It was the only blip in service and they made up for it immediately. And the food... was delicious. I'd definitely like to come back to The Publican for brunch... but especially want to check it out for dinner now.
