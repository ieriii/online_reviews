A gastropub that puts other gastropubs to shame. We started with drinks outdoors at the patio bar lined with picnic tables, then moved inside when the rest of our party arrived. They don't accept reservations, so make friends with your lovely hostess. We asked the waiter to bring us his favorite dishes and enjoyed a variety of imaginative--and smallish--entrees (lots o' meat, beef marrow, etc.) If you enjoy whiskey, just cab over now--they offer an eclectic selection at $3 a shot. There's no need to put off your nirvana any longer. Tip: Try to get a room so you can say overnight above the bar. They were booked while I was in town (design conference week+only six rooms=no dice) but you may get lucky.
