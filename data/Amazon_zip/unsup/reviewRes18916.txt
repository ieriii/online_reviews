Pretty good burger, not great, but good. Great beer selection!  I felt that they are a little stingy with the toppings on their burgers. Nothing bothers me more than a burger with not enough cheese.  That being said, the food was good, I just felt that the burgers were a little small and the fries weren't that great and were a portion small as well.  I appreciate that the burgers are grass fed, but they could do better.  My advice don't be stingy on the fries and toppings, but they are on the right track, just not quite as good as some other burger places.
