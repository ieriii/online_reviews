Let me start by saying I am not vegan... The bacon cheese burger is my fav burger in the city, hands down! Even their soy cheese is delicious. You can't go wrong here, everything is absolutely yummy!!! Coupled with the food, the staff is amazing! Every time I go I seem to come home with a list of new vegan products to pick up from whole foods. They really are committed to helping those on a quest to find tasty substitutes for animal products and really inspire me to convert to this lifestyle. Just remember, it's worth the wait...and you will have to wait.
