admittedly, the staff is very friendly, the ambiance is kind of nice and the food is relatively cheap. usually i can bring myself to account for that in a rating but sadly, the food is terrible. like, truly disgusting. i had the gnocchi. it tasted like a jenny craig dinner, or something that was cut open from a plastic bag and reheated. i literally felt ill for the rest of the evening. i mean, seriously guys? the name of this place is 'the pasta bowl'. chef boyardi can do better. and does.
