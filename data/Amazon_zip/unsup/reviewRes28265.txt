Don't go to Peqoud's for anything besides great pizza or you'll probably be disappointed. The atmosphere is your typical 'pizza joint', nothing special, and the salad and garlic cheese bread were both pretty lackluster BUT their pan pizza is awesome and incredibly filling. It's a great place to grab a cheap dinner and then head across the street to a movie!
