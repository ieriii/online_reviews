The best pizza in Chicago? I think so! Fabulous crust andamazing toppings that always taste fresh. Their tomato sauce is divine and you can order an extra side of it if you are as into it as I am. My friends tell me they have great beer in "growlers" as well. The only downside is that its very pricey for pizza, and always insanely packed.
