This is one of the very few breweries in the world where the food is absolutely on par with the beer. The burgers are probably the best I've ever had in the City - I highly recommend the hombre burger. Never before did I think red pepper crema could be combined with burgers - I am now educated on that issue. Delicious. But that was nothing compared to the pizza - my friend got a pizza with pulled pork and smoked "tomato sauce." It tastes just like barbeque sauce but has the texture of a tomato sauce - weirdly awesome. As far as the place being loud, it is. However, it's not so loud that you can't talk at a table or even at the bar. So go and enjoy - I'll definitely be back.
