I had a scramble with hominy, black beans, avocado and some sort of tomato sauce and it was amazing. The coffee was great, the bacon side dish was awesome and the beignets (is that how you spell it?) were moist and delicious. I had never had a beignet before, but I definitely will again. I'll totally go back. Thanks Darick!
