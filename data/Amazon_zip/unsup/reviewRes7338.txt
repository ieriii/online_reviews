I just have the most fabulous evening at "Q" and had to sit down to write my first ever Yelp review... This place is AH-MAZING! We went for a girl's dinner club and have never had a better experience. The food was fantastic, but the service and atmosphere really made our night. The staff couldn't do enough to make sure we enjoyed our meal, especially our server, Alfredo. A fantastic evening ended with a private kitchen tour from the Chef - WOW! LeeAnn Whippen, you've got a home run here - "Chicago Q" is a new BBQ favorite and I'll recommend it over and over. Can't wait to go back!
