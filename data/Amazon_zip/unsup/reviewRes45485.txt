I do like this place! But....its mostly because of the warm atmosphere. Nice space with woodsy/library like surroundings including a fireplace. You basically walk in and you defrost - think Campbell's soup commercial with the snowman. Yes....just like that! We came here with a group on Halloween weekend and got a table for 9 people fairly quickly (it was Sunday evening). Some ordered food, some just drinks. We had the fish sandwich and it was yummy, as well as the bowl of bisque soup - warmed us up immediately. Drinks were good with a nice selection of beer. Oh, the onion rings - ummmm....overpriced and they ran out of fries!!! SAY WHAT?!!? How do you run out of fries?! Whatevs....it happened. Yes, its pricier then some of the surrounding bars, buts it's also nicer and you do pay for ambiance... Service was fine, although they did mess up our bill 2 times, but it was fine since it was the end of a I'm sure long Sunday evening and I'm sure our server was tired. See...I do have a heart!
