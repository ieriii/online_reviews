I was visiting in Chicago, so of course I had a craving for the famous deep dish pizzas! At Gino's the pizzas seemed to be a bit on the pricey side, and looked like a heart attack on a plate, but I thought the 4 cheese and supreme pizzas tasted pretty good. Between 6 people, we split 2 medium pizzas. The crust resembled more of a cornbread type of texture, which I liked, but may not appeal to all. I think the most disappointing part of the experience was our waiter, who first told me that I could not order a kid's size root beer float (but if I wanted to order food from the kid's menu that was okay), and then proceeded to completely forget to bring me my root beer float. His overall "waiter skills" were below par.
