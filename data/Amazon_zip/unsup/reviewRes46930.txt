I adore Uncommon Ground. It reminds me a little of my favorite brunch spot in the college town where I spent the past few years. Like your favorite diner went local and organic and decided to be a little friendlier to the earth while still serving stick-to-your-ribs comfort food. As previous reviewers have said, however, the place is deceptively expensive. Like, really, really expensive. Nicole C. and I swung by Uncommon Ground for a late lunch a few days back and started with the outstanding goat cheese-spinach-artichoke dip. Warm, filled with wilted greens and soft artichoke hearts, and topped with a crisp crust of parmesan, it may be my favorite appetizer in the world. On a grain-free diet, however, I asked our server if we would be able to get some crudites on the side in addition to the olive oil-brushed crostini. We were not warned about the $4 additional charge that would show up on our bill later. Otherwise? Great food, warm ambiance, and friendly service, even during odd hours. Standouts are the hearty dinner fare including their pork chops, pumpkin ravioli, and sandwiches. Soups are warm and fresh but not exactly hearty. Wonderful beer selection (although, again, you could do 50% cheaper at Whole Foods for local selections) and creative cocktails. Oh, and one of the scariest parking lots to attempt to exit. Eep.
