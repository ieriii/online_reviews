I don't know why I feel the need to comment after 600 people, it's a sickness.  I've lived in Chicago for 5 years... I've known about Frontera for 5 years... I'm a huge Top Chef (Masters) fan...  I also HATE waiting... HATE it.  My wait time will kill a review (see Ruxbin) but please know, I am willing to wait for something that is absolutely amazing and completely unique (see Hot Doug's). All I can say is Frontera lives up to the hype. And there is a lot. I only waited for an hour on a Friday night, granted we came late. The food was unlike any Mexican I've had, it was tasty, unique and I still think about it. It will not be long until I'm downing margaritas at their well appointed bar in anticipation of of my next meal. If you haven't visited yet, you should. Just don't have so many margaritas you can't remember your ridiculous meal!
