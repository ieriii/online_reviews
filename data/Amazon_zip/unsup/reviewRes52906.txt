I'll start this review by noting that the service at this place is pretty outstanding. Everyone was very friendly and even though it was busy, they seemed to be keeping everything together pretty well. Also, it's a nice place - they did a great job with the outdoor patio (bonus for the specialized table for playing dominoes). Their commitment to being identifiably a Cuban joint (outside of the food) is also on display, from the banknotes on the counter to the cheesy murals. The food itself... is a mixed bag. The Cuban sandwich that I had was solid, not stupendous, but certainly not bad, and definitely a hell of a lot better than some of the other crap that's been foisted on me under that designation. I may also have pretty low expectations, since I haven't visited Florida in the past few months, so caveat comestor. It was well pressed and flavorful, with a good ratio of ingredients. However, the yuca con mojo was very disappointing- I believe it was the first time that I've ever gotten overcooked and soggy yuca. The mojo was also bland, which negatively affected the tostones as well. The latter could have been much crispier than they were. Most disappointing of all was the batido (what are these "licuados" of which you speak) de mamey. I can only imagine that the mamey is expensive or something, so they try to stretch it out, betting that most people won't know what the hell one of these is supposed to taste like. I could barely tell that this poor batido was supposed to be mamey, as it barely had that fruity flavor. I do want to try the bread pudding next time- it looked really similar to what my grandmother used to make. I will, however, continue to avoid the pastelitos, because they look messed up, what with that odd coloring.
