I have been here twice during the past two weeks and I have to say the beer is far better than the food. The food isn't bad by any means, just not what I expected after reading some of the reviews. The first visit I had the burger which was good but I have had better seasoned burgers(also a bit dry). The second visit I split the chicken sandwich and fish and chips. The chicken sandwich was really good, the fish and chips was very tasty, the fries were excellent but the mushroom pizza my friend had was just ok.  The atmosphere is fantastic, I love the decor, and the service was great. The restaurant is an amazing asset to the Logan Square community. I am looking to return and hope for a little improvement on the food.
