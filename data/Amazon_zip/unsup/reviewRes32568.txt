Pricey yes. but i say its worth it if you want to splurge once in awhile. food is asian fusion so you know it has to be good. crab linguini is good. oxtail dumplings melt in your mouth. duck hash is amazing. all their fish dishes are excellent. i dunno, u just cant go wrong with anything at this place. ... go all in. its in my top 3 of chicago eats
