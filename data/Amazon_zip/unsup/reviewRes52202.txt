I am not historically a fan of deep dish pizza, I usually find it bland and dry. but I really enjoyed the pizza here. Definitely order a salad, because the pizza really does take 45 mintues to cook, and is worth it. We had a concierge pass to cut the line, but the host still managed to mess up our seating and we were moved around twice, which resulted in our guests losing their camera. Our waiter that we finally landed with upstairs was very friendly and helpful.
