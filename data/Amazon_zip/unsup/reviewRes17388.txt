Every Indian person I've talked to said this is the place to go for some of the best indian food in Chicago. The dishes are slightly pricier than Devon, but I think it's worth it. I usually feel that most Indian or Asian restaurants that spend lots of money on furnishing and cater to mostly non-asians lose authenticity and substance. But, this place proved me wrong and the food was excellent. The complimentary naan with a tomato cream sauce was a great start. I ordered lamb briyani and asked for medium spiciness. Because so far all the restaurants I've tried in Devon had just hot spice and no real taste. I could have gone for a little more heat, but it was still great. I tried the dhal makhani, palak paneer, and chicken tikka. My favorite out of the three was the palak paneer. I'm no expert on Indian food, so I'll take my friend, Amish, and see how he rates it. But currently I'm a bit torn as to going to Devon which is walking distance or driving all the way to downtown with the hassle of parking. Tough choice now that I've been to India House!
