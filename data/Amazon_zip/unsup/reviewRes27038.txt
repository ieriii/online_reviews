great for kids. I'm not a fan of the parents who take over a restaurant when they arrive and pretty make sure that the place accommodates them. Luckily, these types usually bolt for the burbs and frequent their local applebees. Now that i have a child, the last thing i want is to feel like i am trying to make something work when it doesn't. Cognizant of this, i was very pleasantly surprised at the warm reception my little family received when visiting Nuevo Leon. We had a huge time; found out that my daughter loves guacamole, and even got to BYOB a 6-pack like we used to.  I am sure there is better food in pilsen, but i don't think you will find a place so welcoming.
