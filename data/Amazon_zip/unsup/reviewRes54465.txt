Super yummy vegan food options - biscuits and gravy hooray! It can be hard to finding comfort style foods that are meat and dairy free and they have done a great job. Often vegan items are whole wheat and prune juice sweetened lumps of mush and you just want something like everyone else gets and they have a great range of vegan options on the menu- inc deserts! Plus my non veagn friend could eat there too. Quick, comfortable and affordable
