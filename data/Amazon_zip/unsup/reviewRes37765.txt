There's a great patio out back, and an infamously good beer list. If you're a fan of Belgians, this is the spot for you. Also a good list of IPAs, local brews, and a couple of darker beers as well. Prices were a little high for what you get, but the great options made up for it. The services was alright- my favorite part of going to this bar was the great, spacious patio, and the many options on tap. Definitely worth a visit!
