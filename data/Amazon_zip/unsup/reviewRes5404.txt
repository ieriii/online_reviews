I couldn't pronounce half of the things on the menu, but the server was very helpful and took the time to patiently answer my (stupid) questions. The food was good, especially the winter squash arancini and the butternut squash antipasto dish. The salami panini was just okay - I should have gone for the Grilled Cheese of the Week.  And a big yes to the brioche dessert with chocolate hazelnut ice cream. My one caveat is that this place isn't ideal for lunch. The portion sizes, the way the menu is organized, are more conducive for dinner when you are having wine. The food is really just morsels to nibble on while you're drinking. But if you can't booze at lunch, then it's not all that fulfilling. I'll go back for dinner, if I can get a table.
