I must say I am a tapas snob. The beauty of tapas is that you get a taste of many different dishes. That, however, is the downfall of tapas at the same time. Since they are smaller portions the dish has to be made perfectly... there are only a couple bites that determine whether the dish is good or not. With that in mind... Mercat is the best Spanish style tapas that I have had in the city. All the dishes we ordered were very good... not bland or cold or over cooked, all of which are easy to do with tapas. I must make two specific recommendations on the behalf of my date and I... we LOVED the scallops (and he is typically a meat guy) A La Planxa and the Chocolate Croquettes for desert. If you go... try both... you will not be disappointed. By the way... I typically do not go for pitcher of Sangria when eating tapas because it is typically too sweet and made with too little alcohol. Mercat however has some very good sangria... let me know what you think.
