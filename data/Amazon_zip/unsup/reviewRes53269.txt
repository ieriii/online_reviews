Got the season special jalepeno cajun burger...YUM! even tho the jalepenos were too spicy. The popular Rueben sandwich was very tasty, but a little messy. Got the cookie dough milkshake and it was delicious!!!! Must get a milkshake! Our server was good and checked up on us often and was very helpful in choosing our dishes. I can't believe there is no meat in these dishes, bc they are still very tasty!!
