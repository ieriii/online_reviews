Let me just say that I have never posted a negative review about anything before, but the service @ Revolution Brewing in Logan Square was so abysmal, I was left with no choice. Spite is not my intent. Having our server reprimanded for her unacceptable behavior is. We had a large group (7) all of whom were drinking alcohol and eating. We were having a nice time. The food was decent, the drinks aplenty, and we intended on spending alot of time (and subsequently $$). We were either not hipster enough or our server simply did not like us, as she brought us our check at least 5 or 6 times. In fact, she came over with the check more often than she checked in to see if anyone would like to order more drinks. It was simply ridiculous. When the time finally came to pay, our party was split 50/50 on what to do about the tip. We had every right to treat her as rudely as she treated us. The better part of valor prevailed (it is the holiday season after all), and we decided to leave a reasonable tip. As we were saying our good-byes in front of the place, our server, came out with the check AND THE CASH, and claimed that we did not tip her (who does that??). I quickly recounted the money, showing her that she miscounted, and she went back inside with her tail between her legs. Fortunately for us, however, the rest of us will NEVER follow her back into this establishment. I also find it very interesting that another one of my friends from that night posted a similar post on Yelp, only to have it removed. Hmmm .... wonder what Yelp and Revolution are doing. Suppressing negative reviews? Not cool.
