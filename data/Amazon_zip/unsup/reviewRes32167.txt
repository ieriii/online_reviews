Never had Ethiopian food? Well this has been one of my favorite Ethiopian restaurants in Chicago, so its a good place to start! Demera is a small place, located on the NE corner of Lawrence and Broadway. The entrees are best if you share them. Come with a group of 3+ people and order a bunch of different entrees. I highly recommend the cabbage ones, anything involving lentils, and anything involving lamb. (note: I say "anything" simply because I have NO CLUE of the real names of the entres... but everything is tasty). Here's a primer on Ethiopian food: - there are no knives or forks. You eat using "injera" which is a flat bread-like dough that tastes a bit sour. Everyone pinches off a bit of injera, and grabs the food from the center. -Expect a multitude of flavors ranging from spicy, sour sweet, and bbq. -no plates, my friends. Use that injera with skill! -Try the Tuskan beer from Kenya - super crisp, light taste! Enjoy.
