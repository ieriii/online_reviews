I have never been to an Ethiopian restaurant before. I was always under the impression that the country was impoverished and, therefore, lacking in much of a menu, but like so many before me, I was wrong.  All the food was great. I wasn't so hot on the spongy bread--or whatever they call it--it was a little cold and tasted too much like green teat. We ordered a half vegetarian, half meat platter and I could not complain about any of the items. Overall, very good, but I would not recommend for a picky eater.
