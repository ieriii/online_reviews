Dear Yelp and Yelp Readers, If I could give more than five stars, I sure would. This was one of those meals that I will remember for the rest of my life. My best friend and I decided that while our birthdays are a half a year apart, we would take each other to Frontera to celebrate nonetheless. I am SOOOOOO glad that we did. We each started with margaritas. I had the Gold and my friend had the Blue. Now, I love me some tequila, but man was that delicious! We started with the Ceviche trio...OH MY GOD. The tuna was delicious, the calamari/shrimp refreshing, and the fish INCREDIBLE. Seriously, don't miss the ceviche if you come here. WOW. And, the perfect size for sharing; generous but not over done. I had the swordfish with the green mole. Fantastic. It was served with zuccini and sweet potatoes, and cooked to perfection. My friend got the pork with spaghetti squash, another shining star of this delightful evening. For dessert, he got the ice cream with caramel and I had the duo of flan. YUM YUM YUM. I really loved both of these. The caramel sauce tasted like it had chai in it...which was both unexpected and delightful. We also had coffee with our dessert, which was seriously one of the best coffees I've had in a long long time. The service was stellar, and the ambiance comfortable and relaxed while also being eclectic. I will be back as often as possible. Love, Suzanne
