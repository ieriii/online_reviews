We entered the Violet Hour around 5 p.m. last Saturday after some shopping with friends from the UK. I felt like I was entering a cave. A velvety cave, but a cave nonetheless. Maybe the transition isn't as claustrophobic when you arrive when it's already dark outside. Fortunately, we were immediately ushered to a nice cozy booth while our eyes adjusted. It was difficult to see the cocktail menu, and what we could see of the novel-length menu was staggering, but once our drinks arrived and we took our first sips, we knew we'd come to the right place. By the time we could finally see across the room, we were a few cocktails in and ready to call it a night. The line outside was LONG. Great cocktails, ethereal atmosphere, get there early if you don't like crowds.
