I know I'm gonna get hell for this because this seems to be Chicago's newest favorite hot dog joint but I can only give my honest and unbiased opinion. This place has been misclassified as a hot dog stand and it's not. It's a gourmet sausage shoppe whose sausages are served on a bun. Don't get me wrong, their plain ole hot dog is good but if I'm going to go to a hot dog stand, I want to go to a HOT DOG stand not some gourmet sausage shoppe.  That's my biggest beef with this place.
