Longwait but all the more Eager. I heard rumblings about this place a short time back and set my sights on going opening weekend. The rooms that will soon be available for overnight stays above the restaurant were enough to pique my curiosity. Anyone else imagine it was going to look like a saloon out of the wild west with rooms upstairs guarded by railings? It didn't...but I reckon the selection of whiskey was stiff enough for any gunslinger in this here county of Cook.  I expected a full house, but I was surprised to find that I could pass the time with other patrons who gathered around the bar, not just to wait, but to share excited reactions, thoughts, and the occasional cod dipped chip with those around them. While sipping Hot Toddies, Old-fashioned's, Manhattan's, and other speak-easy reinventions , you'd have to stop yourself from starting and closing each one of your exclamations over the bar treats with, "look here!"...this tastes f-ing amazing "you see?" Once we were seated, we were two drinks in with whetted appetites. We stated our intended budget and placed full faith in the server for making the selctions. Out came a detailed, well-informed, description from his finely groomed mustache of the culinary odyssey we were about to begin. We burrowed our way through some bone marrow, ate some cow cheek, had a shots of whiskey, ate lamb, had new unibroue beers he suggested, and i can't remember what we were brought for dessert by then (I was still distracted by the care that went into labeling the two stalls in the men's bathroom with signs "Sit" and "Stand") but i remember it being really good.  In all honesty, it exceeded my expectations. Fun crowd, good food, great drinks, and a friendly staff.
