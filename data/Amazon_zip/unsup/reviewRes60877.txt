I would not recommend. Too many other great restaurants in town.I was there for their opening and was not too impressed, but I figured I would give them time to work out the new restaurant challenges. Well went back this weekend and..well...what a waste of money. Don't get me wrong the restaurant looks very cool, but I went there for good food and service.Also, I read the most recent review that gave them 5 stars and it was obviously written by the management to try to elevate their dismal 3 stars. When I went to the opening they used words like "sexy", 'harvest table" and that is a dead give away that the review was written by them.Sad when a restaurant is so bad that they have time to write reviews about themselves, but not fix the food and service.Good luck Zed...and what kind of name is that anyway?
