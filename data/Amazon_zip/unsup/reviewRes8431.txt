Best pizza in the city hands down! Jonathan greets you at the door and you can feel the love he has for great food and family. The bufala mozzarella is absolutely delicious! Have it in an app; try the caprese or the prosciutto. The melanzane is also a little piece of heaven. If you want some greenery, try the mista, it's fresh and tasty. You can't go wrong when choosing a pizza. My personal fav is the diavola, yum! The funghi y salsiccia is also superb, or if you can't get enough of his perfect mozzarella, try the bufalina. For dessert the tiramisu will delight or try any of his homade gelatis and you'll be glad you did. As you leave you'll be handed a delicious cannoli that will make the smile on you're face ever bigger, if that's possible. Definitely worth the drive!!!
