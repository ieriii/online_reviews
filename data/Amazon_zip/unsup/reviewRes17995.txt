MY FAVORITE ITALIAN in the city! This place is stellar! The food is amazing and it's BYOB. The prices are very resonable for the portions that you get. I had leftovers for days. I have been recommending this place to all of my friends and they have had nothing but great experiences here as well. The only SMALL downfall is the service is a little slow... but nothing compares to the amazing food!:)
