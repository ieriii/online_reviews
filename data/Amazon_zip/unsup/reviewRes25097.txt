costa rican food is pretty much just fresh food prepared well. not alot of seasoning since you want to let the food speak for itself. irazu does just that. good food, cheap prices, and no pretention. the restaurant space is not very big, so it can get crowded. there is a patio that is nice to take advantage of in the summer. oh and they only accept cash. there is an atm if you don't come prepared though.
