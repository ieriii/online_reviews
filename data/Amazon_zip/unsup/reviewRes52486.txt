first Brazilian steakhouse ive ever been to, and i definitely will be making a second visit come my next trip! Good lord i havent eaten so well...it could have been my last meal on earth! the salad bar is top notch...gradually easing you to a FULL meal. their 3-mushroom risotto was perfection, as was the 4 different types of salad. WARNING: DO NOT FILL UP ON THE SALAD BAR...MOVE ON TO THE MAIN COURSE(S) so in a Brazilian steakhouse, the servers bring the meat(s) to you, cut you a slice, and you put it on your own plate. so at once, there are 4-5 servers walking around with racks of meat in their hands. now im a girl that loves food..and what could be better than food you ask? MEN that bring me food! hahhaa. now, i wasnt all so interested in the men, but hey, they have my food. give some bedroom eyes to the guy carrying the chicken and the special cut steak, i've got seconds in no time flat! i dont eat much meat...so pace yourself. i think i almost went blind from all the meat i ate....and i hope i dont develop gout come tomorrow morning. their lunch costs $20 per person, $30 for dinner. its a lot for one person and for one meal, but you wont be needing to eat for the rest of the day and the day after. just pace yourself while you are eating and bring along people who love to eat. if you think you cant take anymore food, just take a 5 min break or have some vegetables from the salad bar.
