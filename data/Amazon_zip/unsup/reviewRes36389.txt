One day, I will order a Thai dish here, I swear. Until then, I will order the salad that comes with with inarizushi & asparagus, and I will order some maki. Why would I do that? Because they have sweet gourd rolls AND the best sweet potato tenpura rolls you ever laid eyes on. WHAT?!, I hear you ask. Where is this? It's at Indie Cafe. I'll report on the Lard Nar or some Pads shortly. Maybe.
