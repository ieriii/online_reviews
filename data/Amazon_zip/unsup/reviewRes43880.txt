AMAZING! When I was in Chicago last my friend and I went to Kinzie for a friend's birthday party. I ordered the salmon; it was the best salmon I have ever, ever had. It was so good I seriously considered relocating to Chi-town. When I went they had a winter deal- so I got an appetizer, my meal and dessert for $20. Very, very reasonable. Also, the ambiance was great. It was upscale but easy going as well. That's the best way I can describe it. Next time I'm in Chicago, you can for sure find me at Kinzie Chop House! happy eating.
