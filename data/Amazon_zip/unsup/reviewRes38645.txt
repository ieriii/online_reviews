I went here about three times and got food once. The food was pretty good and the servers were pretty nice. They don't take reservations, but you just sit at a table and drink a beer while you're waiting which makes having to wait not so bad. The beer selection is pretty good and comparable to other beer bars, I thought. I guess the food prices were a little on the expensive side. I'd probably come back mostly to share a beer with friends. I think what I liked the most was that you could just chat with a friend without having to compete with music or TVs or other things like that...
