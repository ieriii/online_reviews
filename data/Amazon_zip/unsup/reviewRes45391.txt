The place is really nice and the food is very good. The couple we went with drank a lot of martinis and we have three or four appetizers before our entrees. The ambiance is historical with Oscar Wilde quotes on the menu and famous people in frames around the restaurant. I'm pretty sure there were book shelves toward the middle of the restaurant on my way to the restroom with antique decor. The place is quite classic and polished.  It rained that night and it was chilly so being inside Wilde on Broadway St. was cozy with a log cabin feeling for those who use their imagination while they wine and dine.
