I used to be a big fan of Sabatino's restaurant. One time the owner had once made cherries jubilee for my children for free, but today I am a little shocked at what came out of their kitchen this past Thursday afternoon. The minestrone soup was not fresh today. It was pretty mushy & grainy. I feel insulted that they even tried to pass that off to customers. The chicken special was a small, dry, overcooked (kinda burned) split chicken breast with ugly, colorless, overcooked julienne vegetables on top. It also came with a side plate of runny mashed potatoes with a piece of broccoli stuck to it. Took one bite of the chicken and pushed it aside and waited for service. And waited, and waited and waited. The waitress was very kind and polite and asked if she could bring me something else, but only after passing by my table twice. The third time was too late. My companion already finished his dinner. True are the comments about it being mostly an annoying old crowd and annoying businessmen type of crowd. It has only gotten worse. I can't stand middle aged businessmen talking to no one on their blackberry ear pieces. The decor is dumpy and outdated, and the food just isn't the same anymore.
