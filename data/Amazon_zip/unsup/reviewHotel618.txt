Stayed here for a small/mid-sized professional conference. Our room rate was secured at $99 with discounted parking and free wifi. For the price and location, you couldn't beat it. I ended up driving to the city and the hotel was easy to find, parking was convenient. Bed was comfy, pillows were good, concierge was very helpful. The room temp was easy to control (but the a/c was loud). Walkable for many attractions and train.
