I have had several things on the menu, from the filet mignon to the Alaskan King crab. But having been raised near the gulf coast where seafood is a compulsory diet staple, I get these cravings for some really good fried shimp. They are so good at Shaw's they make me want to cry! Seriously, though everything on the menu is unbelievably good, the staff is ever attentive and sees to your every desire. Service is always seamless. I generally always make reservations and have never had to wait more than five minutes to be seated although I must admit my partner and I usually go on a Sunday or Thursday night. We are regular Lettuce Entertain You patrons and are recognized by most when we walk in so maybe they treat us a little special. If that is the case then so be it. I like it! Shaw's is no doubt one of the best restaurants in Chicago. If you are visiting and don't mind spending a little north of 50 bucks per person for a drink, a salad, and an entree, then treat yourself to Shaw's. You will NOT disappointed.
