Oh my, Rick Bayless. What DON'T you do well? I've been here a couple of times with family and it's been awesome both times. The chicken pozole is awesome and the brother loved the short rib soup as well. I have yet to get the tortas, but that's next on the hit list. So. Good. The brother also really liked the beer selection. He settled on Fleur, the beer that Goose Island only brews for Bayless (how badass is that). Fair warning, it's infused with hibiscus flowers. It's delicious, but it has tea-like undertones, which may not be everyone's cup of tea (no pun intended). Let me tell you what, though. It's all about the churros. They are hot, cinnamon sugarry tubes of amazingness. Get them with the chocolate shot. You don't need it, but it's just so good as a dip - kind of bitter mixed with the cinnamon sugar...omg heaven. You cannot NOT get the churros when you go to Xoco. Oh last thing, it seems to get super busy after about 12:30 on the weekends. If you can get there around noon or before, you'll probably only have to wait about 30 minutes.
