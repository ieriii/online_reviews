I am writing this months after i ate here, but this was the most perfect meal I have ever had. I went with two of my friends and we all got the tour menu. Service was spot on and more importantly, the flavors were spot on. Of the 26 items that I ate, i liked all of them except for one, and that's because it had white asparagus in it. I just personally don't like white asparagus, but i know enough about food to know that the flavors in the dish work well together and taste good together. I did drop a bundle on the meal, but it was well worth it. Don't worry about the price, go to Alinea for the experience.
