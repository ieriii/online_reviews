Alinea was everything we expected from one of the world's greatest restaurants. The amazing and unbelievably creative food was sublime (and giggle-inducing at times in its novel presentation!) and the service could not have been more attentive and unpretentious.  The is a very fun place to eat, albeit very costly. Still, given the amount of effort each dish requires and the quality of the ingredients, it is worth every penny. This is a special place for a special occasion, unless you happen to be wealthy. There are just two suggestions we have which could make this restaurant even better.One, given that diners are encouraged to touch many parts of their dishes and food with their hands, it seems incredible that hot, moist towels are not offered to clean one's hands before the dining experience even begins. We WERE offered hot towels after one messy dish but this is after we had already handled our food for four or five courses. Hot towels being offered at the start of the meal seems like a given to us.Also, we were seated in the main floor front room facing Halsted Street and my partner's view all evening long was of the bright lights streaming out of the kitchen just down the hall. This is inexcusable for such a fine establishment. There needs (NEEDS) to be a screen or curtain to block this offensive and distracting view and annoying light from the kitchen. We were fairly shocked that this has not been addressed sooner. We loved our experience (and it IS a total experience) of Alinea but we do hope that these concerns might be addressed for future diners or for when we might return in the future.  Alinea is deservedly acclaimed but they should strive to be as good as they can be in every aspect. Michael Snyder and Steven Bair
