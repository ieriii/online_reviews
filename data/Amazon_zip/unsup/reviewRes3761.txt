Not a chicken eater and man was that a shame here. That chicken looked KILLER!!! I got the Bad Buddah Bowl and it was a delight. So many veggies!! Great sauces on the table. Offered organic brown rice - very nice touch. I added tofu but with everything else happening, it was not necessary. Fairly priced.
