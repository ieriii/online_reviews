It literally pains me to give it one star! I have been looking forward to trying this place FOREVER. I understand that my timing was a bit off considering that there was a groupon that is expiring this week and it seemed like every single table around us had their groupons out so I am completely understanding of the fact that service has to suffer, but it was outrageous. Our server forgot our coffee an ice teas, but did try to make up for it by bringing a small glass of oj . Unfortunately, we actually didn't see her again until the check debacle. At one point we had five empty glasses on the table. My pork chop that I have been dreaming about was so overcooked that the table shook when I tried to cut it. My toast and plantains never came, but no one approached our table until they were clearing plates so at that point I didn't really want them anymore; however I was still charged for them even after I told the hostess that they never came. P.S. - plantains were the aspect of the meal I was most excited for. I basically just needed to vent because I know that it had to be an off day and I would try it again sometime, but without sounding overly dramatic this experience makes me want to cry!
