Been coming here for over a year. My favorite injera of any of the ethiopian places I've tried (Ras Dashen, Ethiopian Diamond, Mama Desta). And the best Sambussas, too. I'm also a big fan of the whole fried tilapia, it's my favorite way to eat fish.The service the last two times I've been here has been SOOOOOOO much better than it used to be. Somebody is doing something right. Keep up the good work. I'll definitely be back.
