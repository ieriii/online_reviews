The farm burger here keeps me up at night thinking about getting it again. The beer is solid, the service is adequate, and the overall ambience is perfect for what it is. But man, a burger with beets and a fried egg? I love it. I'm sure the rest of menu is good (sounds good). Just can't go here without getting my burger.
