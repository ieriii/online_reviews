Was this place worth traveling to Chicago for? Yes. Was the experience memorable and the food amazing? ABSO-FREAKIN-LUTELY! Oh Black Truffle Explosion... I hope we meet again... The food was not only spectacular, but also fun to eat. The place is classy but not stuffy, and the servers were great. http://www.yelp.com/biz_ This is the menu from that day, but you should just let yourself be surprised... The only thing I knew I would be eating was foam...
