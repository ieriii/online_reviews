Prior to eating here, I read tons of reviews on this place--both on Yelp and Metromix. I was expecting one hell of a burger experience. The beer selection was very grand! They will most likely have a beer to suit your taste preferences. Their burgers--well, that's a different story. On paper, my burger sounded like it was packed with flavor. I ordered my fries "creole" style and expected them to burst with flavor as well. When my food came, it looked impressive, but the taste fell short. The fries were too salty, and the burger just didn't live up to its name. For a place that had so much hype around it, I find myself picking other locations in Chicago for a tastier burger.
