I don't know man, nobody has ever been snobby or snooty or hoity-toity with me at the Bongo Room. Service has always been friendly and quick...I mean, not a lot of lengthy chit-chat but I come to eat. Yes, the pancakes are sweet. Yes, the servings are large. Yes, the food is delicious. It is what it is. That's why I go there.
