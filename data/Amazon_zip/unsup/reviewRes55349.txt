The Chenjeh and Koubideh is very juicy and well seasoned. I always get the dill rice as it pairs well with everything. The lamb shank in the cinnamon tomato sauce is great and the meat falls off the bone. The hummus isn't my favorite but the rest of their menu makes up for it. I think I've tried pretty much everything on the menu from the Lake Superior whitefish to the Gheymeh Bademjaan and I'm a fan! Try the hot tea also.
