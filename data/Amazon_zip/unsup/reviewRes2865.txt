I wish everyone could go to this place just once... I would rate this restaurant the best in Chicago - Trotters has great food also, but Tru has better ambiance and service.  Don't miss the caviar staircase, and especially the cheese plate. Just don't eat out for a month to save up cash, and set aside five hours for the full degustation menu...it is SO worth it.
