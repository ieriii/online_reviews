As the millionth review for this Chicago institution, I'll simply comment on the takeout! Typically with takeout you get a diluted version of the food. Likely crammed into a container, soggy, and cold. But not at RJ Grunts! They do a fantastic takeout and while you don't have access to the salad bar (sadness!) you can order anything else on the menu.  It's always more fun to dine in, but I would suggest takeout from RJ's when you aren't in the mood for a loud environment!
