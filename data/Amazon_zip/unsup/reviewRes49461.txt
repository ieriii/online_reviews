I was intimidated at first by the variety and kinds of meat, so I just ordered the churrasquilla (I think that's how you spell it) plate - it's a respectably-sized skirt steak cooked how you want - I had medium - with plantains and potato. The steak was delicious, and so were the sides. I had to say, the accident-prone part of me was nervous about the steaming, hot metal plate placed in front of me, but I'm glad to say I didn't burn myself! The waiter was super attentive and courteous - I felt like I was in a swanky restaurant; that's how welcome they make you feel. I'd definitely go again and try something else now that I know what to expect.
