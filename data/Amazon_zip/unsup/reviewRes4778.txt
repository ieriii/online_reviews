*Could easily get 5 if I go more than once Went here for an anniversary dinner and left without paying anniversary prices. Sat outside and yes, it's crowded and busy but I honestly thought it fit the whole atmosphere. Who wants to eat in a stuffy quiet place anyhow? I can't remember all we got, but it was a variety that was all wonderfully tasty and the things we didn't order sounded just as scrumptious. The dessert, however, I do remember. It was a neutella and banana panini dusted with powdered sugar and I was happy the BF was too full to eat his share. Also, I am not the most graceful of creatures and knocked my wine glass over, thus cutting my finger and literally bleeding all over the table. Our waiter (oh yes, I bled on him too) was super nice, got me a towel and variety of band-aides and when I got back had brought me another glass of wine. Risky, but a good move.
