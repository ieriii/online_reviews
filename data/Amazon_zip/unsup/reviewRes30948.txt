A cute breakfast place. Which neighborhood doesn't need one? Quite frankly, I think it's a must. It's the type of restaurant for city girls to rendezvous and catch up on each other's career, social, and love lives. This place opened and the potential was SO there. I've been here twice and each time was more memorable than the last - not in a good way either.  Last summer I decided to give Nana another chance. My sister haven't tried it, and it was the perfect day and perfect place to meet for lunch. I get to wear my yellow sun dress to visit this cute and very modern/country like breakfast spot. I've dined at Chinese restaurants so I know a thing or two about bad service, but this place got it beaten. Service was non-existent. I kept explaining to my sister "Yea, this was pretty much how it was when I first came here." We even giggled about how it was going to take another 30 minutes for us to get our check. Food: Yes, it's a bit on the pricey end here. It's ok food, but I've been to better breakfast spots like Meli Cafe, Artopolis, and my favorite - Sweep Maple. The service was just so blah that it made everything unappetizing.  The concept is there.  Given the distance from my home, I would have made this a frequent breakfast spot if the service wasn't so .... oh wait - what service?!
