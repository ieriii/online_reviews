Had been waiting for guests to come to town so I had an excuse to check it out, so came with a guest and the BF. We had a pretty late dinner (9pm) which worked out well because the space is relatively small, mostly communal seating which makes it loud and energetic. Opposed to previous concerns about how difficult it was to find, they now have a huge sign right off michigan so it's hard to miss. It's all small plates to share so perfect to come with a smallish group (3-4) or not one plate will be too small. Everything came out randomly but paced well. Best of all, everything was delicious! Esp great for those willing to try new things and esp for pork lovers! He does use every part of the porker!! Must tries: - Beets with goat cheese. Fresh and creamy cheese yum. - Octopus with isreali couscous and spinach: very small order but the octopus was perfectly tender! the couscous/spinach was uninspired - Pork tail: I thought it was going to be fried pieces of curly tail but in fact it was similar to oxtail meat -- braised to perfection! so delicious - Pork blade: one of the best cuts of pork ever! nice crisp but the meat was tender, coated with a subtle sweet honey. SO DELICIOUS! Pretty okay - fried brussel sprouts: oversalted but good - bone marrow: no jam to go with and the bread was too oily so putting oil (marrow) on oil bread put me off a bit; serving is generous with 3 bones Overall a great meal at a great price point. The wines are all international and seems like they are willing to open them and sell as quartinos if desired. Will return again!
