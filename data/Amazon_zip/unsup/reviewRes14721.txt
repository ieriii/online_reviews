Their Bottom Up Belgian Wit is good but nothing extraordinary... I love belgians but this is a little watery. However the Gomorrah is delicious and unique. I applaud their effort to provide excellent vegetarian options, which are clearly marked on their menu. They go above and beyond what I expect at a gastropub type establishment in providing vegetarian alternatives, which was quite refreshing. Veggie reubens? Vegetarian cheddar ale soup? Yes please! I will say, however, that their salads leave something to be desired. I recommend skipping salads and getting a sandwich or entree instead.
