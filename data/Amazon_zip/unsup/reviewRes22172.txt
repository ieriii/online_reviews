Sichuan cuisine is a bit harder to find so I jump at the chance to try restaurants who specialize in it. Found Lao Sze Chaun through some research and reading bout Tony Hu. Apparently this guy is the real deal and all the articles and awards on the windows of the restaurant were proud to let everyone know. Went to dinner on a Sunday at around 8pm and the place was pretty hoppin'. Wait was only around 20 minutes and we ended up splitting a table with another couple (hey..whatever makes me eat faster). Of course ordered the infamous chili chicken, watercress, dan dan noodles, and tea smoked duck. Every single thing was absolutely delicious. The spicy, pickled cabbage given before your meal to munch on is a great preview of what's to come: spicy, addictive goodness. We got the chicken Medium and I think anything else would have been dicey. The spiciness was perfect without being too painful. The chicken pieces were crunchy and delicious seasoned. Bites of white rice (that is $1 a person..lame) and watercress helped cool things down...also the tea helps lots. The duck came with plum sauce and was a solid offering. A good counterpart to the spicier poultry. The dan dan noodles were alright, they came in a good sauce but lacked anything special. The restaurant itself is a funny balance of Hu's global accomplishments and typical Chinese restaurant. The decor is sleek and modern with blown up wallpapers of pandas. Yes, the chairs are clear and kitschy. But the service and food is authentic.
