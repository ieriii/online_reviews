What is not to like about Anteprima? A friendly neighborhood restaurant with decent food and service? One word from our recent visit on a Saturday night: LOUD. Unbearably LOUD. So loud we could not hear each other talk. So loud we could not hear our waitperson and she could not hear us order even when we were almost shouting at her. So LOUD we almost left, and we should have. The food, as usual, was good, but for the prices they charge, a little more concern about the dining atmosphere--the acoustics of the room and the amount of people they cram into what is a small restaurant--should be shown. It was an unpleasant experience for ourselves and visiting friends, and we will think twice before going back.  Food: three and a half stars. Atmosphere: no stars. Be warned. It was like trying to have a nice italian dinner at a frathouse party.
