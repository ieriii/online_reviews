Everyone knows Frontera Grill. If you are one of the "it's overrated" folks than we won't see eye to eye. We waited in line and have no regrets. Apps: The Trio of Ceviche is ridiculous. The Huarache de Carnitas is a show stopper. The Tamales de Elote balanced the spiciness of the Carnitas. Entree: Carne Asada a la Oaxaquena is INSANE! Comes with 2 sauces that I was almost afraid to use on the steak as it's kind of blasphemy, it's so good on it's own, but the sauces are amazing as well. The black beans and sweet plantains make my mouth water now and I'm still full from the meal. Dessert: A Duo of Flan was a true surprise in that they were so unique from each other. One traditional, one more experimental. Both beyond any flan's I've ever had. Even the coffee selection is tough as they have unique types made just for the restaurant. BUT most importantly our service was OUTSTANDING. Our server's name was Maria and she walked us through the menu and her favorites and never lead us astray. When we go back I hope to be seated in her section as she made the experience so much fuller.
