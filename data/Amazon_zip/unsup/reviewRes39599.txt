Yes, the atmosphere feels like a Denny's out of your most terrifying 80's post-prom nightmare. True, the word "gruff" feels inadequate in truly capturing the briskness of the serving staff. And fine, if this is your first attempt at the autonomous exercise that is the full Korean BBQ dining experience, you will have NO IDEA what's about to unfold before you. Explanations are rarely included, at least in my experience. Just let that go, sit back, and enjoy the banchan. I'm not Korean, and all of my Korean food experiences have been stateside, so I can't speak to authenticity, but it's plentiful and delicious, especially anything with red specks (spicier). My favorites included the seaweed salad, brown sauce, and fresh garlic and broccoli (added to the grill). I went with a friend and we ordered the kalbi (pork spareribs) and dakkalbi (marinated chicken)---SOOOOOOO fantastic. We also ordered the dumplings, good, but not spectacular. In the past, I've usually gone to Cho Sun OK, but this is my new favorite.
