I stayed at the Sheraton back in March for a conference. I should preface this by saying I'm rather cheap and really the only thing I want out of a hotel is a clean room and a nice bed. So my bar was pretty average to begin with. What I got was an amazing room (small, yes, but I was just 1 person who'd be at a conference most of the day) with the most amazing bed I've ever slept on, and a freaking awesome coffee maker. The staff was just extremely friendly and accommodating. I spent a good portion of my time in the internet cafe, which was one of the few places to get wireless internet. The staff there would grab me a sandwich or a drink even if they were in the process of closing, which was awesome. Considering the amount of geeks that had converged upon this hotel for a few days, I think the staff went above and beyond to make sure everyone was taken care of. Also, I kinda blame the Sheraton's bacon for my downfall from vegetarianism. One drawback - no wireless in the room. If you want a room connection, it's another 13 a night and they provide a cable, but hey, not that much of an inconvenience.
