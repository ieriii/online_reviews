You must try this restaurant at least once. More often if you like to eat a lot at one sitting. What you'll find here is meat, meat, meat, gaucho dudes in cute britches who bring it to your table on green and who stay away on red, a world-class salad bar, and did I mention meat? Don't eat for a day or so before you go here, because if you're not ravenous, you won't do it justice. And everyone in your party can be happy, because you can do just the salad bar if you'd like. Not cheap, but good food, and lots of it. Save a little room for the papaya ice cream dessert, because the enzymes in papaya will help you digest all that meat!
