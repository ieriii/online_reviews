I give it 5 stars because its our favorite place in Chicago. The food is fantastic, the service is excellent, and the general ambiance is fun. Downside: There is a wait. Solution: Last time we had an awesome time at wine bar around the corner, a place called Telegraph. We stop in had some reasonably priced wine and some appetizers, then carried our dinner back to L&E Great fun. Love the place.
