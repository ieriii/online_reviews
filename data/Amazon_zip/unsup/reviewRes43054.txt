Unquestionably the best deep dish I've ever had. I live in Detroit, but travel to Chicago a few times a year. Every time I go I try to have deep dish from a place I haven't had before. Of all the places I've tried, Art of Pizza easily takes the cake. Tangy, slightly sweet sauce. Not too cheesy, just the right amount. Good meats. Forget the big name places (giordano's, Malnati's, Uno), hunt down thisl gem hidden just outside DePaul's campus.
