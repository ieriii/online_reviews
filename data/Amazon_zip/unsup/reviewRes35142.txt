Best seafood in the city in my opinion! Had a lovely double father/daughter date night here and nothing was left off the menu. If you've never had oysters, try one here! We had a lot to eat: oysters, crab cakes, steaks, shrimp and almost every dessert. I thank my dad's partner for picking up the tab as the prices are not easily digested. However, you can't beat the dining room and attentive staff to fill up your cucumber vodka and soda :)
