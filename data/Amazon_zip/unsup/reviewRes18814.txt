The Gage is a reliably good spot on an otherwise culinarily barren stretch of Michigan Ave. I've stopped in here several times and always felt welcomed and well fed. Perhaps it's the great glass of Guinness on draft or maybe the homey poutine appetizer. Add the pleasant waitstaff, the hassle-free walk-in ability, the dark wood decor and the scented soap and lotions in the bathroom and you have a lovely quick escape from downtown dreariness.
