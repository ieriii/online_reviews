A great addition to lower Michigan Avenue which so needed a better restaurant. I am surprised at the negative reviews. First this is a restaurant that is a first mover in this up and coming area. The set is comfortable-- big large booths and pays homage to what feels 20s and 30s in subtle ways; the service was very friendly and engaging and there always when needed. Helped to hone in on a diners indecision and come up with a selection. My table started with the Vindaloo mussels; the Vindaloo sauce did not overpower the mussels instead perfectly matched the brine in the mussel with the sweet and savory of the sauce. This was a very generous portion--could almost be a meal; ask for more bread to enjoy the sauce.   Enjoy with a large table to not interfere with your meal. For lunch I enjoyed the Prime Burger; expensive $16 but absolutely worth it--a reasonable price for such wondrous quality. The burger was well done with Moroccan olive, lettuce, tomato, red onion and pickles. The olive was such a perfect touch, unexpected but worked beautifully. The fries kept emanating a dash of truffle oil; gorgeous fries; I had to restrain myself from eating every fry. The Amish chicken is a beautiful presentation. Let the wait staff undo what is in the pot; and out comes a beautiful chicken with green beans and goat cheese; the flavors work quite well and continuously play off each other. A small but nice little wine offering; I really liked the wine presentation by the glass; I had the La Planta Tempranillo served in a very nice decanter; I really like this touch and wish more restaurants would do this. The dessert was a chocolate mouse; deep rich and light chocolate mouse with various chocolate strips and powders mixed with ground coffee; a wonderful meal and this was just lunch. I will return for dinner.  Buen Provecho!
