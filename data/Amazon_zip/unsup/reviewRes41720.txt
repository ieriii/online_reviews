Hubby, friend and I went to Pho Xe Tang because we couldn't find Hai Something, which had been highly recommended. I think we'd had too many pre-dinner cocktails and got confused. Anywho, the three of us were seated at a round table for six, which made conversation awkward as the place is already loud with chit-chat and piped in rap (?!?) music. We ordered the Lemongrass Chicken; a noodle dish with beef, chicken and egg roll; the spring rolls ("those raw rolls", as hubby calls them); a veggie chicken dish and some fried egg rolls with pork. I also had the salty lime drink (which I can't spell but generally love love love). It looks awful with fermented brown lime guts swimming in the bottom of the glass, but can taste like the Nectar of the Buddha when properly prepared.  The place is of average size and is prominently located at the entrance to Little Vietnam. Wait staff efficient and friendly enough. "Those Raw Rolls" were okay. Lemongrass Chicken was not really spicy. Couldn't taste the lemongrass even. The fried egg rolls were okay. The chicken/veggie dish was okay. The salty lime drink was okay - rather watered down and this is a beverage that is meant to be fairly sour and salty. It was fairly watery. I bet they need to have three full-time staff to refill the large bottles of sirahcha, jalapenos, fish sauce, soy sauce and chili sauce that sit in a lazy susan on your table. Ours was pretty empty and we had to ask twice for full. We had two sad little pickled jalapenos all alone for quite a while. What can I say? I've been there once and it was OK, so I gave it an OK. I'm probably being generous. I'll try again though.
