I came here with a friend for her work thing - Janet Davies of 190 North was hosting some Women in Finance thing? I felt totally under-dressed as I'm not quite a lady and definitely not in finance. Nevertheless, every single thing I tried was absolutely delicious. Their margarita might have been the best margarita I've had in the city. All of the hors d'oeuvres were amazing and flavorful. Lots of different tastes and spices. The decor is sassy and loud. I'd love to go back for a sit-down dinner. So delicious.
