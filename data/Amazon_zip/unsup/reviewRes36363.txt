Meli is an f---in peach! Not only am i in love with the breakfast food here, i am also in love with the beautiful servers. They all look like night club models. They are amazing and sweet. I mean this in a respectful way, so don't give me the eye! I always order the denver omelet without ham. This omelet is huge and made with organic eggs. It is absolute heaven in your mouth. YUM! I have tried other dishes on the menu and have never been disappointed. If you are ever in this neighborhood and are in the mood for some super fine breakfast food, step over to Meli's and have a fat omelet for me, please.
