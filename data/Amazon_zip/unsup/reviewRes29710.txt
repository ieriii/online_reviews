The food here was awesome. We got really luck and made a reservation earlier in the week. It's not a place I could go to every week but it was a wonderful change of pace. Obviosuly not the same food that you'd find at a local hole in the wall Mexican Restaurant and no chips and salsa when you sit at the table but the food was out of this world. The strawberry sorbet was a wonderful way to end our meal. The signature marg was wonderful and comes served in a martini glass. Much smaller insidethan I anticipated. The bar was very cute and so was all of the decor.
