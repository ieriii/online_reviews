Ambiance is on spot. Fishing nets hanging from the ceiling give a the sensation of near the beach on the Island. Warm inside thanks to the fireplace, out of place for warm environments but not in Chicago. Street parking is tight, best if all arrive in a single car. Our party of six had requested a reservation on line thity minutes befor and it was waiting for us(near the fireplace) on a slow Tuesday. We ordered a sampling of empanadas that arrived fairly soon, piping hot.We orered a couple of sandiwiches for the unadventurous(hamburger for my 8 year-old niece), bistec and lechn. I had to try their Rabo(encendido for clarity's sake, on the waitress later). The food came rather quickly after our expectations where raised by the waitress claim that Rabo would take about 25' as they prepare it on the spot. Who is she trying to kid? Rabo Encendido cooks slowly over hours. Making false claims is always an ominous sign of pretentiousness or ignorance. Bistec looked most impressive and the lechn plentiful. Their Rabo disappointing. I got about 4 fair sized bones that were unevenly cooked. Two I was able to remove the meat easely, the other two I had to gnaw on and work on like a dog. The sauce was salty and I didnt see any veggies. The arroz was fine as were the black beans, not too much cumin. I would have ordered Moros y Cristianos had I seen them on the menu. My companions were not disappointed(I treated them) with their food and would come back(they live near by), I on the other hand would not come from California to taste such low fare.
