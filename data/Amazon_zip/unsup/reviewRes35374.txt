The oyster are really fresh, but a bit over priced. Take them forever just to open an oyster. The waiter was slow and inattentive and we came at a slow business time so there really is no excuse. On top of that, the waiter he doesn't even know his oyster menu, can't even tell which is in season and which is not. Terrible service.
