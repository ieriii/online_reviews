pure foodie heaven. They have all my favorite specialty food brands like honest tea and dirty chips(try the honey mustard...yum). But what takes the cake literally at this store is their bakery/pastry dept. The BEST chocolate cupcake I have ever had. They don't skimp on frosting which, as a person who eats just the frosting and very little cake, I appreciate. I have asked for the recipe but even the person who worked there didn't know it. They also have some other very good pastry treats. My only suggestion is to offer more vegetarian-friendly options in their deli section and cafe.
