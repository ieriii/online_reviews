Okay so, I just got home from eating at the chicago diner and it was super duper good! I had a college visit at UIC and had to check it out. I read a ton of reviews before going so my expectations were high. Upon entering, I was shocked my the small size. Its super tiny! I (4 year vegetarian) came with my mom (meat eater) and there was like three 2 person tables available and we were seated almost right away. It was full of hipsters with their skinny jeans and tattoos. haha, it was cute. The waiters/waitresses were super hip and sweet. My water was never empty. We ordered the spinach artichoke dip for our appetizer and it was good but not great. It coulda used more spinach but we still ate it all. I got the avocado tostados since i was nervous about the whole fake meat thing. My mom got the chili. My tostados were crazy good! sooo yummmy. I'm still full. My mom loved her chili and ate every bit of it. However, the people sitting next to us, (literally like right next to us. its small.) got the ruben and now i am regretting my meal choice. It looked amazing to say the least. Still, Our meals were delish. I wanted the cookie dough shake but they were out :( pooh. so i got the chocolate peanut butter. it was good and tasted like a resse cup. All together my bill was $34. not too bad. We plan on going there again when i take my placement tests and other school stuff. This place is a must for vegetarians/vegans! even my mom, a proud meat eater, added this place to her top 5. try it out
