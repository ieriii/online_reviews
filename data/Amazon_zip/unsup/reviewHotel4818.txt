Very nice roof top deck over looking the city.Take people from out of town to see Chicago from one top of the building. Food is OK try the pizza the other food is just bar food.Did not like the attitude of the staff. They are trying to create the feeling of an exclusive club. Its hard to get in on Friday and Saturday nights. Good for out of town people to visit.
