The Grand Lux Cafe has a large menu, good food, big drinks, and well designed dining rooms. That being said, I think this place suffers from trying to be all things to all people and the result is that nothing stands out to me as being truly exceptional. Because it does offer such a wide array, it is a good place for a large party (I have been there several times for company holiday parties and the like). I have had great food there, and so-so food there. I have had to wait for over an hour without a reservation, and close to an hour even when I had a reservation. I have had great service and rushed, less competent service. Being all things to all people can make it inconsistent, too, though I have generally left The Grand Lux satisfied, and sometimes very pleased. If I could rate this a 3.5, I would.
