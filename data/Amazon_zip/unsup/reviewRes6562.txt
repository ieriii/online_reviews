The food was some of the most flavorful and creative I've had in a while and nothing I'd expect from an italian restaurant. I came expecting the usual flavors of pastas and veals and chicken dishes but was presently surprised with the creative menu. Most of the menu dishes are small and probably a little over priced for the portions. The ambiance was rich and felt cozy and chic at the same time. We sat in the back where all the bottles are stacked so it feels like you're in the cellar. The service was excellent with attentive and personable waiters and busboy, which you need since the dishes come out at a good pace and the tables are only barely big enough to accomodate your wine bottle, glassware, dishes and a shared entree. However, you never feel cramped. And after asking the waiter to turn down the base on the speakers, this was a comfortable date place. As for the food, I recommend everything we ordered except for the better than average, but nothing special, pizza with procuito di parma. The beet salad had great flavors which popped in your mouth. The Large riggatoni with sausage was cooked perfectly. The octopus was delicous and tender however had a bit too much mayonaise sauce on top which detracted from the seafood (I'd still recommend the dish). The pork belly with apple chutney was cooked well and had the right amount of salt and sweet for me but might be a little too rich for others since it's essentially thick bacon. We had the pear bread pudding with gelato for dessert which was also great. The wine we chose was great and reasonably priced too. Overall, the restaurant is really good and would have gotten 5 stars if the prices were lower...or the portions were bigger!
