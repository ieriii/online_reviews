This steak house was outstanding. We were visiting Chicago for the weekend & had to go to a steak house. We chose Kinzie thanks to other reviews here on Yelp. I can't say enough good things about the restaurant. Funny story....My wife is pregnant. We were being seating at a small 2-top that was in a bit of a tight spot. My wife took off her coat, revealing her "pregant-ness". Within a millasecond, the manager, Courtney, swooped in from somewhere and put us at a 4 top with plenty of extra room. I'm not sure where she came from, but it was extremely nice of her. I highly recommend Kinzie Chop house
