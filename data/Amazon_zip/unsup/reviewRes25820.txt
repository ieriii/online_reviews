Every last bite was sublime. Beef and chicken salads were fresh, with perfectly cooked meat and piquant dressings. Egg rolls were delicious and served so hot that I could barely eat them. Entrees (mango coconut beef, pineapple calamari, fresh crab noodles and roast duck) were all spectacular. The BYOB element is a nice perk - one of the waiters even helped us finish our leftover beer! Also, 8 of us ate for $93, and we ordered some of the most expensive items on the menu. I had to knock off a star because they gave away our table and we wound up waiting an hour. Still, the staff was very apologetic, stuffed us to the gill with egg rolls while we waited, and comped us salad and dessert. If I could overlook this and give the place 5 stars, I would. I expect it will not be an issue on subsequent visits, and I'll be able to reward this place for its excellent food with a 5 star rating!
