I Thought this place was great! The food was fantastic, the server was very helpful and it has a great atmosphere. I especially enjoyed the rooftop seating area, it is romantic and takes you away from feeling like you are in the city. The only complaint I have is our table was extremely small and on top of that the wood was warped so you could only use half of the already crowded small table.
