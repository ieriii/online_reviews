I am spoiled. I live in Toronto, I frequent Montreal. We have the gastro-pub thing down I suppose. The Gage was recommended to us by staff from our hotel when we were too hungry to think and were unable to get wifi access. While beautiful, formal yet just relaxed enough, I was really not blown away by any means. Service was decent, wine overpriced. At $13 a glass or so for a mediocre malbac. Toronto averages about $10-13 a glass as well, but our liquor tax is astronomical. I purchase bottles in the US, you guys have it good. The price per glass vs per bottle cost is skewed. The ambiance was alright. Friday night had alot of semi-comfortable looking dates, some after work buddies, some tourists like us in their best "Out On the Town" dress. First Course, Poutine to share. Awful poutine. Yes, I know, i am Canadian, why in God's name would we order poutine? Regardless, little frozen peas and carrots in the gravy? Blasphemous! Second. Two of the DCs got Fish and Chips which were the star of the show. I got a half chicken with poached pears and some Chard. It was alright, but not special in my opinion. The last of us ordered the homemade sausages which came with killer potatoes and brie. The sausages were good, but hard to distinguish a real difference of flavour between the three types. The bread and butter was nice. The server, forgettable. Too pricey for the overall experience.
