Here is how I can sum up our dining experience at Piccolo Sogno: a slow and steady decline. I'll break it down chronologically 1. Bread - the foccacia and other bread was great. I almost ate the whole basket by myself. You can accent the bread with olive oil or balsamic vinegar. 2. fried calamari - superb. Some of the best I've ever had. A light breading which allows the calamari taste to remain present. Not over-fried. Just a delightful way to start the meal. 2.5. the marinara sauce. Did not come out with the calamari. Maybe about 3 minutes after the squid hit the table. WHY? Anyways, I did not enjoy the marinara sauce, because it tasted like tomato bisque. But the other three diners at our table loved it because it tasted like fresh pureed tomatoes. To each their own... 3. Entres: gnocchi, pork tenderloins wrapped in prosciutto, pasta with asparagus and truffle oil, short ribs, and rizzoto. I sampled everyone's entres, and the best was the pasta w/ asparagus. But that may have just been the truffle oil entertaining my taste buds. the gnocchi was a little too salty. The pork tenderloins were too thick, which made chewing a chore. the short ribs were average, and the rizzoto was no more memorable than the other dishes. 4. Pepsi. the waiter asked one of our diners if she wanted another pepsi. She said yes. The pepsi never came. After we had settled the bill, a different server approached our table asking if anyone had ordered another pepsi. 5. Spilled water. As one of the waiters was clearing the table, he knocked over a glass of water. Fortunately no one was splashed with too much water. And I am not faulting the guy for something that was unavoidable, but merely giving a factual recount of our dinner. So as you can see, the food was underwhelming. The service was average at best (one unforgivable gaffe, and one understandable accident)
