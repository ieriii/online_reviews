Colleagues of mine raved about this place so we decided to get a group together and go, and for many of us it was our first time there. And....it was incredible. Everything good I heard about it was true and then some. We had about 10 people and got two ducks, orders of bok choy, broccoli, fried rice, noodles and tofu/black mushroom. Everything was incredibly delicious. The duck, by far, was my favorite. It was perfectly cooked, tender and the seasons was insanely delicious. I'm so glad I got to take leftovers home! The restaurant is huge and apparently, if you want to dine there on Friday/Saturday night, you should make a reservation. I can only imagine what that place looks like packed. Service wasn't the best, rude and not very attentive but the food was so good I that I can look past that. Seriously, delicious, I would 100 percent go again.
