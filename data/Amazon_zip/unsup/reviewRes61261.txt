If you want to impress a date, or even a spouse, try this place. great quality, well prepared, and served superbly. Not to mention a kick ass salad bar. One problem with some brazilian places, is that the different meats seem to taste the same after a while. Not here. each cut had its own marvelous and distinct, (and truly tasty) flavor. All in all, this is a great place to experience some beautifully prepared and served meals. Definitely a place to come back to.
