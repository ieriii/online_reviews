My friend and I were very impressed with this Greektown breakfast and luncherie! The menu, at first look, may seem like any other for breakfast. Pancakes, skillets, and scrambles... check, check, check. But, then, look further and then you find a good size list of healthy options...crepes,  fresh juices and smoothies, and it's homemade fig jam! OMG, soooo yummy. I had to take some home! The jalapeno skillet was made with the freshest organic, fluffy scrambled eggs, veggies, including the fresh jalapeno, not the jar kind! The potatoes were not overdone and the chicken chorizo in my skillet was utterly tasty! We were surprised with the healthy portions and the homemade multigrain and wheat bread they serve. I definitely need to become a regular here so I can try all the rest! There were customers with babies and tiny tots there who were so well taken care of here at Meli's! So nice to see! The owner and waiters were attentive and friendly despite how busy they were when we went. Good vibe here most def!
