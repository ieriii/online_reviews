If heaven is bittersweet chocolate French toast stuffed with maple mascarpone with crme brulee sauce, bananas, and shaved chocolate, then I was in heaven at Bongo Room on Saturday! Our experience starts with the inevitable -- waiting for a table. We had mentally accepted the possibility of a long wait, as is Bongo's reputation. So as the birthday boy and I settled in to enjoy the views on Milwaukee, we were excited and surprised to only have to wait a couple of minutes. As we entered the dining room the host joked, "Sorry for the long wait!" Sarcasm, I liked him already. Located in the center of eclectic Wicker Park, Bongo Room offers an aesthetically pleasing environment for all senses! The long narrow dining room boasts a combination of old world charm, with exposed brick and colonial columns, mixed with modern stainless steel ceiling fans and wall treatments. The small, open kitchen reminded me of an old school diner minus the excessive grease and flies. Our server was nice, accommodating, but not over-the-top. My mimosa was delicious, with fresh raspberry and pear juice. The food, though, the food is what WOW'd me! And isn't that the goal? The above mention French toast can be ordered by the slice and that is exactly what we did. It acted as a dessert to our delectable egg breakfasts and created the perfect balance of sweet and savory! They had me at "dill" which was cooked into the potatoes and was an unexpected and delightful surprise!! I don't know how they did it, but a simple omelet with onions, spinach and Muenster cheese what out of this world! I can't stop talking about Bongo Room! I even had to communicate my joy to my peeps back home in Denver! While we were there to celebrate the birthday boy, I felt pretty special in my own right to have been introduced to pure decadence!!
