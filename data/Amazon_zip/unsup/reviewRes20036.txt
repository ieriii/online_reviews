1st time- Walked in, bland lobby area with BYOB bottles already opened up all over the place, whatever, and a waitlist early on a Thursday evening- fine.  I stood by the sushi bar before seating to scope the product and was overwhelmingly surprised then overly excited to just sit and eat it all. The dining rooms are nice, cozy but airy/open, active with a pleasant buzz. The server was cute, quick to greet but rattled off the specials while staring out the window.  Guest and I got into our wine: grenache/shiraz, the mushroom appetizer came out in good time, but we waited a good length for Round 2... I could have cared less until my guest seemed bothered by it. Over 25 minutes. After which, we were presented with three rolls of a decent size -meaning at least I could fit a piece in my mouth without awkward ugliness.  Lastly, hit our big plate of sashimi. DELICIOUS. Bright, young flavors. Delicate, moist. Until I bit down, found a hard spot in my Unagi, eel, ??? swallowed and ended up with something (a fish bone) lodged in my throat.  True story, and I never thought it would happen to me.  Oh, the dangers of sushi-consumption! Oh well.  Three trips to the bathroom with my hand in my mouth, trying to find a plastic-y needle-like thing poking me from inside the neck. The manager was attentive of course- bringing hot water to soothe, rice balls to shift the sharp thing, more ice water to rinse down, and finally -fourth try in the ladies room, gagging all the while - gross - I got it, the prize, like the Golden Ticket, a baby Bone!  All that drama, and I really just wanted to eat more and more and more! I've been dreaming about The White Dragon roll and toro, himachi, hirame. BYOB: Bring plenty to drink or just walk 3 minutes to the Armitage/Damen corner store for an alright-okay Bev. selection.
