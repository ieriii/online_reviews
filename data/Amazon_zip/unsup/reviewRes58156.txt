Mercat is a cool place with interesting food. The tapas are unique, well done and expensive. The restaurant itself is a large circular room with a high ceiling. It is located off the lobby in a classic old hotel on south Michigan Ave. The place has a distinctly chic urban vibe. Overall a very good experience.
