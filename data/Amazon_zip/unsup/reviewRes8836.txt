I feel I have to leave a review for this one because so many people have raved about it but I was seriously underwhelmed. I want to second someone else's review that the crust was SOGGY. I mean - disgusting soggy. Italian pizza is crisp, no? And terrible atmosphere. It was like being in a cafeteria.
