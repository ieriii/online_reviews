Great hotel in an excellent location. Rooms are small - older building - but the rooms have been updated and are decorated well. People at the hotel are super friendly. Cafe in the lobby has amazing coffee. Huge farmers market in the park across the street on Saturdays - plan on making that breakfast if you will be there on a Saturday morning.  Work out room is as basic as it could be but has a couple of treadmills and an elliptical trainer, plus free weights, so good enough.
