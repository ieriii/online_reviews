I apologize, in advance, for the graphic nature of this review. I don't know how to say this except that the food was delicious on the way in, but I did not enjoy my post-digestion experience with it. The meats were all seasoned and cooked to perfection (except for one bleeding item that I was told was cooked "medium"). But I was rushing to the bathroom immediately after the meal was over, and I didn't over-eat. And I didn't have to vomit. That's all I have to say. I'll end this on a positive note and say that I love love love love love the cheese rolls and the mashed potatoes. I don't enjoy deep fried bananas; Fogo de Chao's pan-fried plantains. If I ever go back, it'll be because I forgot about this experience and just remembered the deliciousness of the fine meats.
