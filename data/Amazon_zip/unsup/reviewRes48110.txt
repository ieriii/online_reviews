It's really hard to say one restaurant in Chicago is your absolute favorite but I would be hard pressed to find somewhere I love more than the Publican at this moment. We went last night and had quite the feast... - Trio of ham: Good start, very thinly sliced, serrano was the favorite - Pork rinds: super crispy and crackly - Oysters: I forget which kind they were, I think Island Creek, but our server described them as magical and they kind of were - Potted Rillettes: pork cooked in it's own fat until it's spreadable, according to the waitress. we asked for a bathtub of it and she suggested a wheelbarrow, it would still cover the important parts. Seriously the most awesome server in all of the land. So that was all just appetizers...then we got "real" food to share. - Veal Brains: Never would have ordered this myself but so good. Crispy on the outside, creamy on the inside, kind of like crab rangoon but a million times better. - Rabbit Tortellini: Um, yes. A hundred times yes. - Cassoulet: So rich and flavorful and now I only want that when I am home sick during the winter. - Suckling pig: Really tender and just good. - Sweetbreads: By far my favorite dish of the night, caramely on the ouside, soft on the inside. Just get over your pickiness and order, everyone at our table loved them. Vegetables: - Radishes: skip these, nothing special - Sweet Potatoes: awesome - Cauliflower Gratin: Can we have this as the side at every meal from now on? SO FREAKING GOOD. Dessert: - Lemon Meringue Pie... with CHOCOLATE! Why does no one else do this? - Waffle: I don't know what they put in this waffle but probably it's crack. - Limoncello: It's creamy! Surprise! And so good. And with that we rolled our fat asses out of there and down the block to the Blackhawks game. Best dinner and best waitress. Oh and the beer and wine were still amazing. You really just need to go here.
