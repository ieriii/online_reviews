Sun Wah. (google translation: I love you) Roasted duck hanging in the store front windows....ahhhh just like any Chinatown. This place is pretty large upon entering, and gets packed fairly quickly. Our party pre-ordered a roasted duck and underestimated its deliciousness. The skin was perfectly crispy and glistening with delight, while the meat was juicy and tasty. Combine that with the fluffy bao, sauce and pickled radish and you will do the same as we did, and order a second duck halfway through the first one. Oh yes we did! There are so many other yummy options on their menu that we caved in and had a small order of salt chicken and roasted pork. I love lechon, therefore I loved the pork. If that wasn't enough, we also had 2 rounds of fried rice and soup, since it automatically comes with the roasted duck. What a feast! A cheap corkage fee for the byob was icing on the cake. I'm so glad I was introduced this place. It's like Chinatown just got soooooo much closer to me!
