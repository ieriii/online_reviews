I have been to Coast 3 times. All three were great UNTIL I got food poisoning this past Saturday evening. I have a pretty resiliant stomach when it comes to food but have never been so sick. I got the "sushi entree" dinner with sashimi and a california roll and obviously, something was not properly handled. I will never be back and will warn others as well. Food poisoning is not to be taken lightly!
