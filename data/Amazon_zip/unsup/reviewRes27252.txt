Food coma. I just got home from dinner here and I am so so happily full.  For the food alone, this experience would rate 5 stars. Everything was outstanding. From the chips and salsas (and chicken noodle soup!) you get just for sitting down, to the quesos we ordered as appetizers (huge and full of melty cheesy delicousness) to the meal (I had the combination because I couldn't choose but everyone's food looked amazing) everything was delicious. It was hard to stop myself halfway through the meal and get a take home box (because, you know, I was stuffed from the queso) because it just tasted so good!! Service, on the other hand, leaves something to be desired. They get kudos for trying.  However, it should not have taken us 30 minutes just to get our check. They were clearly understaffed. Luckily, we had plenty of wine to make the time pass and the food was so good that the service didn't matter as much. Oh, and did I mention that it was also super-cheap?? My combination meal (1 taco, 1 tostada, 1 enchilada, 1 tamale) was only $6!!! I will definitely be back!!
