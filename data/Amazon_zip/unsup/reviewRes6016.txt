I'm usually not big on Italian food, but Davanti, you won my heart. Right away, I was drawn to the rustic interior with its wood ceilings (floors, too), touches of exposed brick and soft neutral hues. Fantastic use of space against the back wall - loved how the bottles of wine (for sale to drink on the premises!) are so cleanly stacked! It's a known fact that the more organized a shelf/rack is, the more inclined one will be to make a purchase. Especially when one is drinking vino :) Speaking of wine, you can purchase it by the glass, quartino and bottle. And, the prices are quite reasonable! Davanti also offers a fine selection of beer and martinis. The food is also reasonably priced... I was surprised at how much food our party of six consumed for the price! Seriously, I think we attacked the entire menu. Since Davanti primarily does small plates, order a bunch and you'll get to try a few bites of just about everything. We tried the following: + Several cheeses + Prosciutto + Capicolla (loved) + Roasted cauliflower steak + Stewed calamari with pine nuts and raisins (magnificent) + Truffle egg toast with fontina and asparagus (a must!) + Giant raviolo with ricotta, egg and spinach (straight sinful) + Pizza della Terra (mushrooms, leeks, taleggio, truffle oil) = WOW + Bistecca alla Griglia (a gorgeous, flavorful hunk of beef) This is as good as it gets, Chicago. REALLY. The service was flawless, the food to-die-for and the wine selection is dizzying. I've got a real romance on my hands. Now who's taking me back for an encore performance?
