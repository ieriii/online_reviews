If you go here get a torta (sandwich)! I ordered the cubana torta which was delicious. When I go back, it will be hard to order anything else when I know how much I loved this sandwich. The bowl things are kinda weird. My husband and one of the friends we were with ordered a bowl and we were very surprised when it came out as a soup. My husband got the pork belly bowl which was had 3 or 4 pieces of pork belly slices and other things in a large base of broth. It was extremely difficult to eat - though it did taste good (I am just not really a soup person). He definitely had food envy... He also ordered the hot chocolate which was very unique and good (though I am not sure we would get it again). Last thing to comment on is the ordering process. You stand in line, order, and wait for someone to tell you when a table is available. We pretty much sat on top of the people next to us (literally). This was alright because we were hungry, but it definitely was not comfortable. You also serve your own water. It is definitely a casual place so if you dine in - go for the food and not the dining experience. Prices are a bit high ($12-$15) for just a sandwich, however they are delicious so I would pay it again for sure.
