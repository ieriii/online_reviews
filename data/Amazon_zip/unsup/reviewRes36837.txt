AMAZING!!!!!!!! If you are looking for food that you know is fresh and has actually been made and not reheated... this is the place... my favorite 2 things about this place.. 1) any type of juice you order is made fresh, e.g: the apple juice is dark, warm, and has foam.. 2) with your order you get an order of greek toast with fresh strawberry and raspberry preserves which is sooo delicious! plus the staff is so friendly and always makes sure you're taken care of.. it does get crowded, but thats a sign of how popular the place is! you HAVE to try it!!!
