This is another of those reviews I've been meaning to write but got lazy. Sorry. Doing it now because this place is worth going to at least once. We went for a girlfriend's birthday. Honestly, we were a rather large party, and you know what a pain those can be for restaurants to deal with. But this is a big place and we had reservations so it wasn't a problem. Oh, and a word on reservations...make them! This place is crowded, whew! I never realized how many people are into porky goodness just like me. Well, we hung out at the bar for a while until all our party arrive and our table was ready. Nice bar with lots of high-tops. But the fun starts with dinner. First, the oysters. This place has beaucoup oyster varieties! We wanted to try them all, so we each ordered our own tray with one of each. When I say beaucoup varieties, I mean it. I swear I must have had about 10 different types of oysters! Now, The Publican is not a traditional restaurant. Everything is basically small plates of stuff. But, oh, what stuff! Heavenly stuff! I had the Serrano ham, the pork rinds (not the cheap yuck kind, but beautiful tasty rinds), the charcuterie plate and the pickles. Oh, and these aren't just pickles as in the cucumber things. They are all sorts of pickled veggies that they pickle themselves so the selection varies. If you ever get the chance and have some extra money to spend, go spend it here.
