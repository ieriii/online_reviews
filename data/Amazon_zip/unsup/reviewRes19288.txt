So few burgers hit the 5-star stratosphere, but you can definitely find a few here. On a recent trip, I was drawn by the lure of the renown Pat La Frieda meat, and I had the wagyu on a pretzel bun. It was absolutely perfect - juicy, flavorful - requiring minimum condiments. Easily as good as the Black Label burger at Minetta in NYC. The main reason for the 5 star rating is because we tried another burger - the Slow Burn - and agreed that the meat itself was every bit as good as the wagyu. Very worth the trip up the brown line!
