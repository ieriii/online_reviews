We stayed here for 3 nights, June 30th-July 2nd. It was perfect from beginning, (upgraded us to the top floor) to the end. The Front Desk, Concierge, and the Doorman were all friendly and helpful. The room was stylish, hip, and comfortable. The bathroom is especially nice with dimmers on the lights and the sliding door and the beds are heavenly! I ate at the restaurant for breakfast and I could have split it with two other people, it was huge, but delicious. The Hotel is perfectly located for all Chicago shopping and dining. The Front Desk and the concierge both gave us awesome restaurant recommendations. Check out time is 3:00!! unheard of.........so great, no rushing around to check out. I would stay here again for sure. Oh yeah, we saw Adam Levine coming in after a night out .........so Rock Stars stay here:)
