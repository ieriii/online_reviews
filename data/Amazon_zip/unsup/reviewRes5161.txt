I went here last week with a few friends, hearing that it was on Bon Appetite's Best New Restaurants list. The sign, "Cheese, swine and wine", three of my favorite things, got me quite excited. Initially shocked by the peculiar seating arrangement, I adapted and actually had a few great conversations with new people. A "girl and the goat" type, where a group orders several dishes, many of which are not your "mainstream meats", I was anxious to eat. We ordered six dishes between the three of us. The highlight, surprisingly, must have to be fried pig ear. With fried meats like pig ear, I was worried about maybe being overcooked, or possibly too chewy. I couldn't be more wrong, And the combination of pig ear with the peppers and kale was delightful. The second best dish had to be the JLT, with jowl (pork cheek) replacing bacon. The sandwich, although small when divided amongst three people, was delicious (then again, I am a sucker for fried egg). Why not five stars? First, the cheese plate was good, not great. And the other dishes, the corn and tomatoes and prosciutto bread balls were good, but left me thinking that they could have done a little more with those dishes. A great spot for a unique dining experience on the mag mile, especially fun for groups!
