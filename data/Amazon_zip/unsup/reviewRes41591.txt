Giant and comprehensive menu, authentic ambiance (crowded and noisy, you will be seated at the same table as strangers, and you can actually have a beef penis-flavored pho if you know what to order), fast service, awesome food. Its a little bit on the expensive side for such a dive-y place, but they seem to have invested in new menus, so maybe they are trying to go more upscale than hole-in-the-wall.
