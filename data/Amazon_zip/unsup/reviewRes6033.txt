I could never understand why there was a constant flow of people pouring into Wildfire. From the outside it looks a little well, how can i say this tactfully. Welll it just looks a little dated and seedy. So when my apartment sent us an email about a happy hour there I dithered about going. At the last minute I decided to go. I tromped down the block wondering how awful it was going to be. I opened the first door and *ish* I opened the second door and was instantly bathed in the honey glow lights of an old style steak house - so elegant , so refined, so old school I swear I sighed with pleasure just standing in the bar. The happy hour was so pleasant that I brought friends back a few days later and we indulged in a full on heavy calorie laden food fest. We had the calamari and drinks ( I had the Martini flight which is a darling idea, but they don't stay cold enough to really enjoy all FOUR mini delights. I had the smallest fillet crusted with horseradish and OMG - I don't eat steak often, but this was spectacular. I know true steak lovers disapprove of sauces and crusts and such, but this was delicious. I had asparagus on the side, again perfectly cooked. Yummmmmmm Our waiter was excellent, charming, unobtrusive and extremely handsome. which of course added to an over all experience of luxury and enjoyment. What makes me extra happy is that I have been looking for a neighborhood place where I can go by myself to have a drink and a little something now and then. I think I found my spot. You may find me singing "wildfire" again and again!
