was able to come by for lunch. was told the ahodaga torta is the way to go, and girl you did me right! a clean pork torta, crispy fresh, sitting in a spicy soup. mmmm, for real, how can a simple torta be this good? the soup is a bit spicy for most peeps i would think, but i love spicy. it acts as a hot sauce i guess, as u usually use hot sauce/salsa on mexican food. was also told the hot chocolate is something they do special, and i'll try it next time. had a churro after the meal, and it had a unique hearty flavor to it, different cus normally their just sweet. it was really good. i know frontera will be worth it too when i have the chance.
