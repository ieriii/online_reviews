loved the experience but left questioning was the food that good. Positive + expedited service, order food and your table is waiting + lemon drink + local food sources + chips and guac Inbetween +/- Churros.... had better Negative - nasty pickeled peppers on my torta - 1 hour from when you arrive until food is delived
