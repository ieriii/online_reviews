By recommendation of a local bartender, my family and I had trekked out to Pequod's for some deep dish pizza. It was relatively dead on a Sunday around 3 pm. I don't want to say that the service was bad, but the waitress seemed like she vould care less. Rarely came to check up on us. The bus boy and another gentleman (manager?) came to check on how we were doing and they were both much nicer and more pleasant. I'm not quite sure about the caramalzied crust that everyone was talking about. There wasn't that much of a crust, and it wasn't that good. The pizza is mostly dough, like another person had mentioned. The crust at Lou Manalti's was much better, but Pequod's toppings were phenominal. They were fresh, big pieces, and all over the pizza. If only we could combine the two!
