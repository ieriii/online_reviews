This used to be my favorite restaurant until today, the day of the downtown Irish parade when one manager (who called himself Chad) just couldn't handle the crowd or something & ended up treating me like crap. One misunderstanding involving an appetizer my table accepted by accident led to him talking to me like I was a complaining customer and not someone trying to rectify a situation that MY party actually caused. Even if I had been complaining, I have never had a manager talk to me in such a condescending tone, even telling me that my table overreacted to the situation. It wasn't even a situation until he got involved. Maybe if this Irish restaurant hadn't been blasting Little Wayne & if Chad had been listening a little closer, I would've left happy and satisfied instead of pissed and disgruntled. Kudos to our waitress Bianca, who apologized profusely and to the nice Irish woman (another manager?) who spoke to me before I left, but the actions of that one rude man have completely ruined Wilde for me. I don't normally drop $100 to be talked to like a piece of crap, but apparently today, I did. Won't be returning.
