The staff is great. They are very genuine and helpful. The food is very good. Their dishes feature lots of meat substitutes like textured veggie protein and seitan. They also have lots of pure vegetable dishes. So there is something for everyone, even if you are not a vegan. I have been there with hardcore meat eaters who enjoyed their meal and the experience. The decor is not very interesting but the music is always fun and often eclectic.
