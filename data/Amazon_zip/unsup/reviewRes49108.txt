Publican has a) a great beer selection b) cool aesthetic touches (bathroom was a little treat I have to admit) and c) tasty meats, for the more adventurous types who never think about the process of a house made sausage, head cheese or calf brain. But...there was something a little pretentious about it. Did we see Jim Belushi there? Yeah. So I guess maybe it's warranted. A special occasion place for sure.
