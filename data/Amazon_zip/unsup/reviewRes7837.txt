I'm a recently converted paleo diet guy, and this place is the center of the paleo universe. 3 tips on strategy: 1. To begin, don't go to the salad bar. If you do, then only put tiny items on your massive plate. The final plate shouldn't look like comfort food at a buffet; rather, it should look like ultra haute molecular gastronomy. 2. Don't eat any of the (unsolicited) carbs that they put on the table: polenta is boring, bananas are cheap, and mashed potatoes are ... okay, they are good, but that's not why you went to Fogo de Chao. 3. If anybody asks if you need anything, tell them that you want the filet mignon to come around. Nothing would be more tragic than spending $50 and getting full before the filet rolls around. Don't leave this to chance; speak up. All of the meats are good, but the filet is just a little better. 4. Always direct the meat cutter to give you the smallest amount possible. This will make you more likely to try all of the meats. Bonus free stuff tip: If you are there for a special occasion (birthday, graduation, engagement, anniversary, etc.), let the waiter know when he or she inquires. At the end they'll bring out a huge piece of chocolate cake. Its not good cake, but you know the old line about sex and pizza: even when its bad its good. While nobody should lie about these matters, of course, shyness is not a virtue in this context. Granting that I am not keen on my Brazilian stereotypes, but they don't strike me as a delicate or fusty people.
