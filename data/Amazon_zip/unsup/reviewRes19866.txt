Oh my . . talk about a food buzz!! Bayless is a genius and thank goodness he calls Chicago home. Went with a friend Saturday afternoon and the line was almost out the door but we were dying to check it out and decided to wait (about 35 min). It was totally worth it and Bayless himself was in-house behind the counter putting finishing touches on the dishes and walking around greeting folks- we thought that was pretty awesome. Getting down to brass tacks . . the food- Woodland Mushroom Torta The combo of roasted garlic-mushrooms and goat cheese was delicious and the black beans and arugula topped it off. Oh and the 3-chile salsa was so tasty, not too spicy and didn't over power the other flavors. Great choice. Side Salad Not your ordinary side salad. This side included slices of jicama, arugula, and cucumber dressed in avocado-lime dressing. Refreshing and good.  Churros Yum. What's not to like about fried dough topped with cinnamon and sugar? We also had chocolate and caramel as our dipping sauces. Amazing. We both ordered an agua fresca and they were pretty good. The entire menu sounds amazing and I'm definitely looking forward to trying more dishes. Oh and they also have a chocolate espresso, can't wait to try that! As a side note they offer take-out daily after 3pm, a guy in my building shared that with me in the elevator the other day when I asked what he had in his bag that smelled so good, his reply ". . well I don't want to torture you . ."
