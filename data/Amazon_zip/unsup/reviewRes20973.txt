The Gage is indeed a 'gastropub'. These things have been popular in Britain for years, (yes, they have good food in Britain now, it's just a well-kept secret). Having been to a fair amount of these types of places in the UK, I think that The Gage really does hit the mark. The menu features tastier, slightly more innovative versions of regular pub fare, in keeping with the whole gastropub thing. The draught and bottled beer list is serviceable. The waitstaff is very good. The cocktails are well-made. The atmosphere is nice and decidedly unannoying and not full of assholes or too many tourists, considering the location. The proprietor is a pleasant Irishman who actually seems to care if his customers are enjoying their experience. I look forward to visiting this place again, (in direct contrast to my next destination that fateful night: The Violet Hour) As someone who more or less that the Loop is Chicago's equivalent of San Francisco's Fisherman's Wharf (full of fat pasty slow-moving tourists and to be avoided at all costs), this is a place that would actually bring me to the Loop. Finally, a reason besides changing from the blue line to the red line....
