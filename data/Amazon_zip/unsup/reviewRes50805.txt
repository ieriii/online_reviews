We went for Sunday brunch on 8/22. Running this meal in Andersonville is tough but we were sorely disappointed by our experience. We waited 20 minutes after our reservation and finally got a table. When we asked the hostess she said we were waiting for the table with two ladies by the window who had their check for an hour. I was surprised that we were told which table we were waiting on and that there was nothing to do to encourage them to leave in the busy time. I mean come on, it's Sunday brunch and you're going to chat for an hour after your meal. boo! The food was good as usual as was the coffee but the water glass my wife got tasted like dirty sponge. It was quickly replaced but come on... Sunday brunch requires a well oiled machine and this week, Big Jones needed to work out a few more kinks in its system. 2 stars for you Terri
