At first I was dissapointed that there wasn't a Kyochon in Chicago because I want what I want and at that moment, I wanted garlic soy chicken!  I ordered just the wings and when I recieved them, I was apprehensive because they weren't as tiny as Kyochon's so I expected it wasn't going to be as crispy. I was wrong not only were they crispy but they were wonderfully filling (As a comparison, 1 Crisp wing = ~4 Kyochon wings). 4 stars for the food .5 for exceeding my expectations and .5 for turnng my frown upside down. Now, when I'm in LA, I'm dissapointed because they don't have Crisp and I want what I want.
