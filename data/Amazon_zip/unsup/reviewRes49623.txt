Do you like steak? Can you say you've had the most blood-quenching, saliva inducing, unfathomably delicious steak yet? Please do you and yours a favor: experience the incredible cuisine of Las Tablas. The house skirt steak is to die for. It is marinated in heavenly juices. Really, I can't describe this anymore before I start drooling in reminiscence. El matrimonio is a quality choice: fine/sizable cut of the house's skirt steak and the house chicken. Buenisimo! Not to mention the sides of plaintains, yucca, potatoes that accompany the meal. The mojitos are the best I've had in the city -- sipping rocks of cane sugar, delicioso! Highly recommended!
