I know that visitors to Chicago always want to go to Gino's East, but Giordano's has the best pizza in the city!This particular location is great because it's near CTA, South Shore and Metra. It's also near Millennium Park and has a view of the beautiful courtyard at Prudential Plaza. On a nice day - or if the restaurant is extremely busy - you can get your meal to go, complete with utensils and plates, and have a picnic in the courtyard or the park.
