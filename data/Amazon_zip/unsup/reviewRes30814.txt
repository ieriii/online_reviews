Nana's certainly does a great job of incorporating a Latin twist menu filled with fresh organic ingredients. I've been there a few times and I have had different dishes each visit. Recently, I had the tofu scramble, which was very good. The decor is light and very clean. The staff is welcoming and accommodating. Prices can be a bit high, but for fresh food, a clean restaurant and welcoming staff I would say that it is acceptable.
