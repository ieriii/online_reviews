My sweet BF knows how much I love sushi and found this place for a date night. What can I say about this place? Well, the experience was eccentric to say the least. This place looks like it used to be a bar converted into a restaurant. The layout was a bit weird (the building is in a triangular shape). What I found most entertaining was the anime music video playing on a huge screen on the wall. You don't see that often... This place is tiny so the bf and I had to wait. But no worries, I love BYOB places and we started our dinner with some red wine. This is not your authentic sushi joint with fresh fish, but I am perfectly fine with eating fusion sushi (just as much as i love americanized chinese). Not sure if we would go back again if I were to return to Chicago...it is located at a weird intersection so unless you have a car, it's a little annoying to get to by CTA especially when it's storming outside.
