This is the place for authentic Chinese. The menu is overwhelming with over 500 dishes. And unfortunately the wait staff may not be of much help due to language barriers, and a review intheir own window suggested asking for a manager or Tony the owner. There is usually a line at the place and No reservations are taken. Regarding the menu, you have never had a pot sticker until you had had them here. The other dish I reccommend is the Sesame Chicken. I know this dish is fairly common, but it was amazing at this place, the flavors blew me away. I've seen many different things being eaten at other table, some in large bowls and under burners installed at the table or brought out with the dish. So, knowing what to order might be a matter of who you know, so ask for a manager, or talk to people while you wait if it's not too jam packed. It is also fun to get to Chinatown, walk around, see the people, shops, etc.
