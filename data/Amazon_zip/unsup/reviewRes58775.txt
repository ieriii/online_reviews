This place is great! Since my previous favorite *weekly* Thai place is dying, I decided to check this one out. I was not disappointed! Food was fresh and freshly prepared. Chicken and fish were prepared to order, not prepped ahead of time and warmed up. Yes, it took slightly longer to be served the entres but it isn't fast food after all, and it was worth the wait. Four stars only because they need to turn on the AC. We were there on July 13 and it was cooler outside than in! But, don't let that discourage you. The service was great and the price is right! I will be back!
