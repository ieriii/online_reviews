I love pork and therefore I love The Publican. Their menu reads like a foodie's wet dream, which makes it tough to narrow down your selections. The three most memorable things about the night were the crispy pig ears, the head cheese and our friend not realizing the hot waitress was hitting on him. We didn't drink nearly as much beer as I thought we were going to, but I blame all the pig we ate. The choices were certainly there were we willing. The community tables is an interesting idea, but I'm not sure it's for me. Thankfully we had one of the penned in booths; an improvement that still had me feeling a bit claustrophobic. I could see how people wouldn't like the atmosphere, with the hustle and bustle, but the food makes it all worthwhile.
