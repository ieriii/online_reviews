I absolutely love going to Carnivale. Driving on the highway the first impression you get of Carnivale is their massive sign which is colorful and full on the side of their building. Once we were inside Carnivale, we saw that the massive sign fit right into the atmosphere and ambiance. Everything is colorful and right from the start puts you in a GREAT mood. We went to the bar and got drinks while we waited for the table and the sangria was delicious, you can never go wrong with a good glass of sangria at a place like this. After we were seated and had looked over the menu we decided on ordering the guacamole as an appetizer and boy were we right! The guacamole and chips are to die for. It was probably the freshest guac I have ever tasted. After having such a good appetizer we were afraid we were going to be let down by the meal but thankfully we were wrong. The Arrachera (grilled skirt steak with rice, beans, sweet red onion and a chimichurri) was unbelievable. I had been told to order this dish ahead of time since I am such a fan of skirt steak and in no way was I disappointed. If anything I am saddened that no other skirt steak may live up to Carnivale's preparation of it. When cooked correctly, skirt steak is an amazing piece of meat. Unfortunately we were way to full to have dessert which from the looks of other table was really good. That just means next time I go I will have to save room. The service was great, in no way did we feel rush or forgotten about, it was perfect. The only criticism that I have about the wait staff is their ties. They were like mini ties only about 1/4 of a normal tie. While I understand why they wear them (so the ties don't move around as much and get in the way of the food) it is rather unattractive looking. Oh well, if the worst thing about the restaurant is the ties, I will go back any day! Can't wait to get back there again and try something new!
