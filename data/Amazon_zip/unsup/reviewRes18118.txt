I'll keep it short since everyone has already said it - Xoco is amazing. The line/seating situation is well managed in my opinion (it could be a disaster!). The wait really wasn't bad with all the activity going on. We had the pepita (short rib) and ahogada (carnitas with tomato broth) tortas - both delicious. Warning - ahogada has spice levels and medium was VERY hot. Chips and salsa were good, chips reminded me of Fritos...in a good way :) Churros amazing as advertised. Next time I'll try the chocolate or ice cream for dipping. It was all YUM YUM YUM! Can't wait to go back.
