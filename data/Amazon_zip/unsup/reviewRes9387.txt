We celebrated valentines day with brunch at Sprout and overall it was enjoyable but there were little things that kept it from reaching the level of 4 or 5 stars. I really enjoyed my apple crepes, a perfect mix of sweet and savory. Hubby got the duck hash. The duck was unevenly cooked as were the veggies. Taste and flavors were there, although the carrots were an odd component. We also had the Lithuanian bacon buns. They were interesting and pretty tasty...once our server remembered that we had ordered them as a starter after we already had our main dishes. Otherwise the service was fine but nothing special.  Hubby also had a virgin bloody that he said was really tasty. I stuck with coffee. Total bill was $54, which I felt was a lot considering we weren't ordering cocktails. As far as atmosphere, we really liked the bright sunny front room. But the rap music during brunch was odd.
