So there are about 4 or 5 Iranian joints in the whole city, this being one of them and if I had to rank them I would say this one is some where in the middle. I liked my kabob but for $15+ I need more then 1/4 of a grilled tomato and slice of green pepper, I think I also got the onion heart. That sort of sucked. Portions are decent but the veg part on both our dishes was lacking. Shiraz salad was good, best in the city so far. Service was also average and I feel like we might have had a better experience if we ate at the ToGo location a few doors up, they don't have wine though. They didn't do anything to make us not want to come back but since going several months ago we also haven't been back or even discussed going back. Take that as you will. Noon, I just don't know.
