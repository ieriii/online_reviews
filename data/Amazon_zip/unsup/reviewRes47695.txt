Yuck. My sister made a reservation here for Christmas Eve (by accident, she asserts). This is just Fogo de chao in sheep's clothing. The big complaint I have is that it wasn't clear from glancing at the website that this is a Brazilian steakhouse. So: this is a BRAZILIAN STEAKHOUSE. The "harvest bar" (read: salad bar) is basically just what you could get at Whole Foods' pre-made food bar - but somewhat less creative. The waiter was really corny. The plus is that design of the restaurant is kind of cool. I guess if you like the Brazilian steakhouse thing, this place is a fine entry in that category. I, for one, prefer the wax kind of Brazilians.
