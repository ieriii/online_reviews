I've been here a few times, and always had a pretty good experience; I have to believe that Amanda B.'s nightmare of a time was an exception and not the norm. I first came to this place because I heard they had a good beer selection, and on that count they definitely do not disappoint. They have an extensive selection of beers on draft and in bottles, with an emphasis on Belgian and Belgian-style beers. I've consumed my fair share of beers from around the world, but I don't think I've even heard of half of the beers on their list. The food is also spectacular. They don't have much seating in the dining areas, so waits are usually pretty brutal. Get there early to minimize your wait. As many others have mentioned, the CB&J sandwich is practically life-changing. It's my favorite item that they have on a regular basis, but many of their other items are also fantastic. The Stilton mac & cheese is quite good if you like blue cheese. I also have once had a lamb stew that was cooked in Brother Thelonious beer - this was unbelievably delicious, and it really hit the spot in the middle of winter. Hopefully, they keep this recipe around. The only food item I didn't enjoy was the steak (why did I get a steak and frites at a Belgian bistro-style place? I have no idea) which was overdone.
