Have only gone once, to pick up food for a picnic (take-out), but will definitely be back. Got falafel sandwiches, extra pita and hummus, some soup - all super yum! It felt a little like the soup-nazi episode on seinfeld though (I was a little nervous to get up at the counter and mess it up somehow). I'd definitely recommend it for good prices and excellent middle eastern quick-food.
