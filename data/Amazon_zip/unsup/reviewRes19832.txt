I don't understand the hype surrounding Coast. I understand it's BYO and there' s a lot of variety, but honestly, do you really think those rolls are top-notch, inventive, and tasty? This was my 2nd time back, and among a party of 4, we had a good 7-8 rolls, from signature to simple makis: volcano, sunrise, spicy scallop, negi hamachi, spicy tuna, spicy ebi. NOne of them had distinct flavor, and I couldn't taste the fish in any of them. Even worse, the spicy sauces weren't even spicy.  Maybe it was an off night (it was a Sat night), but everything was just barely at standard for me. There are too many BYO sushi places in the city for me to return to Coast.
