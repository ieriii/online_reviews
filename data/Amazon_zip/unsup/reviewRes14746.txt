I've only been here for drinks and it's a great place to mingle and have a great beer. This is a great spot to try different types of beers you normally wouldn't. It gives off the nostalgic feel but it's dark and cozy and friendly and a good place to get away from the cold. Looking forward to going there again when I'm in town!
