OMG...i've tried almost all the thai places lining Western ave up here in the square and now that I've found opart it will take a really good review to sway me. I've ordered from here twice now once for take out and once for delivery. Delivery time = frickin amazing I was quoted 45 it was here in 20. Unheard of! Both times the food is phenomenal. First time Tom Kha soup great flavor nice blend of cocunut and spices. Second time Wonton (they put the dumplings and veggies in a seperate box so nothing gets soggy!) Really really flavorful broth soup. Shumai app tender, moist great dipping sauce. First time ordered ginger chicken based on other reviews great. Second time was with bf got shrimp tempura crunchy not soggy which is great for delivered fried food...and the pad see eiw is just as good as everyone else says. Also really enojyed the fried rice. Flavorful not too much egg or soy sauce was really surprised cuz i don't really care bout fried rice but bf does. Can't go wrong here so far!!
