It took us 3 tries just to get a taste of their treats. The first two times we visited, we entered and found no clerk was present. We had several minutes alone to drool over the selection before the clerk returned. When we spoke up to place our orders, the clerks informed us they were closed. CLOSED - Yet the lights were on, the doors were ajar. This happened TWICE. Both times we entered before closing time. Once, a clerk informed us they had already counted the till. We then offered to pay w/o receiving change and he still refused to serve us.  The third time we did get a cookie and cupcake. However, the treats weren't delicious enough to erase the sour taste left behind by the poor customer service we had encountered previously.  Now, we just go down to Letitzia's for delicious treats and great customer service (plus they are open late!).
