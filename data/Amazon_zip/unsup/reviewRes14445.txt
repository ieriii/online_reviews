Been here twice now, and looking forward to more great times ahead. The real reason to come to Revolution is the brewery. It is really cool to see all the brewing equipment and then notice all the custom-made beer taps - you can really feel the dedication and energy that goes into the place. The beers that I've tried so far were excellent! Workingman Mild - refreshing! Cross of Gold - crisp and only kinda hoppy! (I'm not into hops, BTW) Coup de Grace - delicious! I really like the thematic element to the beer choices, and I'm amused and interested to see what beers come next. So far we've had burgers, wings, and the pizza. All are recommended. The wings were fantastic stand outs. I would come back just for the wings. And they were served with a little side of blue cheese potato salad that I stole and gobbled up. It gets very busy here, and there is often a wait for tables. I really recommend coming in for lunch time or in the early evening. When we visited in the mid-week evening, I saw a lot of families bringing their kids here. I was puzzled, but it's really not that bad for kids - it's not Wrigleyville, it's not frat-boy-infested, it's not a sports bar.
