the best! i've lived in chicago for 16 years, and eaten a lot of pizza. and although i'll always prefer thin-crust (i eat pizza for the toppings, not the crust), i gotta confess that pequod's is hands-down the best deep-dish i've ever had. nothing even comes close to their carmelized cheese crust (which somehow isn't overly dense) and zippy, not-too-sweet sauce. it's pretty far from my house, so no delivery - boo! - but sometimes the cravings are so strong i'll fight traffic and make the trip. it can get crowded on the weekends, so go early, or try a weeknight.
