A thin veneer of elegance fails to conceal a lot of sloppy upgrades over the years. Many fixtures in the room were loose (power outlets falling out of the walls, bathtub faucet flopped around), and the furniture was worn. Understaffed, had to wait unacceptably long to check in due to a guest in front of me having a complicated issue and no other front desk being available to assist other customers while it was resolved. That said, the room was clean, the location excellent, and we got a great mid-week deal. Good for the budget-conscious traveler who's not looking for any frills.
