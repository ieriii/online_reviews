Came in here last night to celebrate the wonderful Emily L.'s birthday! We were a larger party and had to wait for some people to arrive, which meant that they wouldn't seat us. I understand that this is the policy, and they kept our table so that was much appreciated. I ordered the triple karmeleit (sp?) which was DELICIOUS. It also hit me very hard. I was tipsy for the remainder of the evening, and didn't have more than one beer! I loved how smooth it was and would definitely order that again. We ordered mussels for two for the table to share. WOW. We chose the Belgian-style broth, which proved to be an excellent decision (yay!). We were all so happy. The little pieces of celery mixed in with the mussels added something great too. And the fries that came with the mussels were really superior. I LOVED the aoili that came with the fries. It was all just perfect. I chose the CB&J as my main course. Yum, as usual. This is truly a perfect sandwich, and who doesn't love the Stilton mac and cheese on the side? One of the busboys brought out the birthday girl's main course with the mussels, but our waiter caught that and took it away. All of our courses arrived at the same time. I'd highly recommend this place, for a normal or extra special meal. We all left full, happy, and not too much poorer!
