In my heart, the udon from Sunshine and the pho from Tank wage a pitched battle for soup supremacy. I have infinite love for the udon, but lately my love for the pho is infinity plus one. Is it the fixins? Is it the addictive and abundant noodles? Is it the inevitable slurping and splashing action? I don't know, but Tank pho currently = my favorite meal in the city. Like many mention, the place is always packed and hopping, but I think that's part of the charm. Between the crowd and the 300+ item menu, though, be prepared for sensory overload upon first visit. *** EDIT *** I'm upping the rating to 5 stars. On my last visit, I had an egregiously heavy hand with the hot chili sauce in my pho, resulting in lip numbness and a nose runny enough to require 10+ napkins. Having hastily demolished this infernal potion of deliciousness, I got up too quickly and was seized by a lusty eructation. For a moment, by heart felt like it was being squeezed, hard, by a fist made out of fire. It was one of the more thrilling experiences of my life and I commend it to all. Happily, I'd had the presence of mind to order a strawberry bubble tea when my eyes started tearing up midmeal, and thus was quickly able to restore the balance of hot and cold humors in my body.
