I and a group of friends were at Gilt Bar this past week end. My experience was really great, fresh well prepared food, lovely service, and a beautiful environment. I just read some reviews here, also I guess about this past week end, that sounded like they were at a different restaurant.  Besides that, they didn't even make sense. One hated it so much they had to stay two hours. Another stayed three. It must have been just awful for them, as well as confusing, as they said they were planning on coming back. They sounded really angry. It makes you wonder. We ordered a variety of plates so we could share and they were large enough for all 4 of us. My favorites were the pate, scallops and steak but others went for the pasta dishes and salads. I'm not a big drinker but I liked the cocktails.I think Gilt Bar is great!
