Cute place, but the pizza just wasn't good. When you order it, your waiter will tell you it takes a long time to make a pizza, and you say that's fine. For the next 45 min-hour, your hunger grows while thinking of the awesome pizza you're about to stuff your face with. When they bring it out to you, the place it on the special pizza stands that all of the tables have, and serve you your first slice. My friend and I got the stuffed crust pizza with sausage.. while the sausage was really flavorful and REAL, there was just wayyy too much cheese and not enough sauce. I mean really, there was barely any sauce. It was like.... some bread, layers upon layers of cheese, and a spoonful of sauce on each slice. If you go here, avoid the stuffed crust!
