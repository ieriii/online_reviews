Finally made it here after all the hype and talk only to be blah! I didnt think it was nothing special. typical lettuce and tomato type of sandwich on french bread. Nice cool decor. ok place but there are better Cafe's in Logan Square. I try them again some other time, maybe it was just an off sandwich.
