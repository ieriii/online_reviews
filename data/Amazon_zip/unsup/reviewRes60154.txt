Still not very fond of this place. Came back a 2nd time and tried some other options off the menu and it all just came back very bland. Ive eaten at other vietnamese resturants and the food has so much flavor! but tank noodles always skimps out on flavor, and fills up the dish with too much raw vegetables (a nice gimmick to keep the prices high and the actual food portion low).
