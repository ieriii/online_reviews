Hotel staff was very friendly and accomodating. The rooms are very nice size and clean. The rooms all have oversize Jacuzzi tubs, without the jets, but still nice since they are large enough for those of us who may like the extra room. The neighborhood seemed a little bit dumpy but I never felt threatened or afraid. The parking lot is fenced in but not locked up or closed in and well lit. It is away from the main stream of downtown Chicago, but close enough that you can easily get there in a taxi. For those that are unfamiliar with taxi's, chicago is one of the cheapest places to use a taxi. I took the taxi from the Hotel to a restaurant on the north end for under $12. You just don't find that anywhere. Did I mention that the parking at the hotel is free as well. If you have a large vehicle they do have some street parking behind the hotel. With the hotel on State street you can easily catch a metro bus as well to downtown, quite frequently.
