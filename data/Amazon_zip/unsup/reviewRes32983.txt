I have to give Little Bucharest 5 stars because the owner, Branko, is an absolute class act. My wife and I were planning to dine here for our 3-year anniversary, but naturally we chose Tuesday for our date -- the one night each week when Little Bucharest is closed. The restaurant was locked up when we stopped by. I peeked through the window and was ready to head back to the car when Branko opened the door and walked out onto the sidewalk. Before I could say anything, he shook my hand warmly and apologized for being closed. No big deal, I said. It was my mistake for not calling ahead or checking the website. I mentioned that it was our anniversary, and Branko broke into a big smile. He insisted that we follow him inside and enjoy a glass of wine on the house. We were both taken aback by his generous offer of hospitality. I looked through the doors and saw a laptop and a sheaf of papers at the bar -- he was clearly doing paperwork during the one non-busy day in his week. But again, he insisted. We followed him inside and he sat us down right by the window -- nevermind the headaches that might be caused by having the two of us drinking and laughing where passersby might see us and wonder if the place was open. Branko turned on the lights and fired up the music system and brought us out two glasses of white wine. Then he quietly returned to his paperwork, leaving us to enjoy our glass of wine. He was the consummate host the entire time, and he firmly refused my attempt to pay for our wine on our way out (had to try, right?). His exact quote was: "Two free glasses of wine aren't going to make me poor." Of course, we resolved to come back on a non-Tuesday to actually dine at the restaurant. But as far as first impressions go, Little Bucharest was extraordinary.
