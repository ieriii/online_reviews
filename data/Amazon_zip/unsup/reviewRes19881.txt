Went here with a group of 20 people to celebrate my birthday and I'm so glad we chose Coast. Pretty much every single one of my friends had been except for me. I'm a huge Sushi fan but don't live in the neighborhood so I had yet to venture out. Big props to our waitress for handling our demands as we ordered 4 of pretty much everything on the menu. I think we had more bottles of champagne and wine on the table than food, so everyone was enjoying themselves. I also want to give a big shout out to whoever was taking reservations. As my party grew, I kept them updated throughout the week. It went from 12 people to 20 people which pretty much maxed them out in that back room. They were always very friendly and willing to make sure we were comfortable. This was on a Monday night, so it was easier for them to deal with such a large group, but still...mad props! The sushi was really tasty and everyone was enjoying themselves. I loved the atmosphere. I think the waitress said at one point that we had the highest tab she's ever seen in there. Either way, it was a BLAST. I'll come back with a couple of my friends next time!
