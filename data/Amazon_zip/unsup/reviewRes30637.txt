I consider myself a bit of a fake-meat expert, and for my $$ I'd much rather get my seitan fix at blind faith in evanston. Or, if we're dreaming, at red-bamboo in NYC's village. Any veg-head that finds yourself in New York MUST visit this place. And bring me back some veggie buffalo wings. Please. I must admit -- I did not try the vegan milkshake on my visit, but I would go back to do so. I do not have a heart of stone.
