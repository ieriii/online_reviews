Quick tips: -Get the sausage giardiniera -Put your name down, figure out what you want to order, and place the order before they seat you so your food comes out faster! -5 stars for the deliciousness -5 stars for the price (6 people, two medium pizzas, beers = ~$10 a person) We came here on a Sunday evening with a group of 6 and were seated in about 20 mins. The sausage giardiniera was fantastic. As a San Franciscan, I will qualify that this is my first true exposure to Chicago deep dish pizza from Chicago, and it was pretty amazing. Pequod's was highly recommended by friends who live in the area and while I acknowledge everyone has their 2cents about their favorite Chicago deep dish, this one definitely lived up to expectations. If you're new to town like us, take the Red line up to check this place out!
