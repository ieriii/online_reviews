I have since gone back to Xoco many times and it has quickly become one of my go-to spots in the city. My biggest issue the first time I went there was that the bread on which the sandwiches were served was way overtoasted and actually hurt my mouth when biting into it. Since the, they seem to have perfected the cooking time for each sandwich in the brick-oven because they are not as hard and much easier to eat. I assume they were still working out the kinks when I first went to the restaurant. The sandwiches are delicious. They have great flavor combinations and are quite hearty. Simple but complex. The service is great as well. Finally, though the prices are a bit higher for your typical sandwich, they are well worth the money. High quality ingredients with quality execution. Great experience. Love it.
