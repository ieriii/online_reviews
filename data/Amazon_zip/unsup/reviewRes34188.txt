I read so many reviews in hope that this might be like my favorite falafel place in DC but it came close. The falafel is not my favorite here but I like the lentil soup and the meat combo. It is really cheap for the amount of food you get and they have a huge salad buffet with alot of selection. Parking is difficult here and it is cash only.
