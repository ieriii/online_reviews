We LOVE Simply it. My husband and I moved to Lincoln Park and were lucky enough to be .5 mi from this gem! The service is wonderful. The staff is SO friendly. The staff remembers us every time we come in and 9 out of 10 times brings us a free appetizer or hot tea. The food is FRESH and delicious! And, it is BYOB! This is our cozy go to place! We love it! Must try! We recommend the Lemongrass Chicken and the Pho Ga!!! love love love.
