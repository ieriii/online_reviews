Cool vibe to this place, once you walk in, if you have never been there prior you might be shocked. The place is huge and is always happening! Apps, meals, drinks are all great here. Been here twice skirt steak and the pernil. Both meals I was impressed with. The apps I think I went w/ the asparagus one. I do believe it was wrapped in proscuitto or some form of meat. Cant think of it but it was really yummy! You cant go wrong here. Its cool, trendy, fun, lively ambience, just an all around good place.  Trust me you wont be dissapointed!
