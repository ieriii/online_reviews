The grilled baby octopus is my favorite thing on the menu! I could eat this EVERY day!! It is fresh and flavorful. I also love the greek salad with chicken when I'm trying to be healthy but still want to enjoy dining out. The chicken kabobs are also good and so is the saganaki. Definitely give it a try if you are in Greektown.
