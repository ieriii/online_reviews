I finally made it to Carnivale after the last couple years of hearing about it. I will admit, I wasn't that impressed. We went here for my friend bachelorette party so there were quite a few of us. We called about a month in advance to make a reservation. When we got there, it took them a while to seat us. The waiting area was large but we were packed like sardines. When we got to the table, they brought us over some guacamole and chips to start. However, then we were charged for it. They took it off the bill but it was one of those things where I was thinking, what if we wouldn't have noticed? I got one of the chicken dishes. The chicken was very dry in my opinion. They definitely over-cooked it and it was not appetizing. I did like my pomegranate margarita but that was about it. Not sure if I would head back to this spot for dinner again.
