I've been to a few churrascarria restaurants in the past, but nothing tops the Texas de Brazil on Ohio St. in Chicago. The castle-inspired interior of the restaurant was absolutely breathtaking and the salad bar (should really be called appetizer bar) offers something for every single craving you may have. Gourmet cheeses, meats, salads and even sushi are among the 75 + items that are offered. Make sure to pace yourself, because once your card is flipped to 'green' on your table, the gauchos will come in hoards, offering an array of Brazilian-style cooked meats. I tried every one of them and could honestly not tell you my favorite!The most entertaining part of my evening was the 'aerial wine artist' which, leotard-clad, soar through the two-story see through wine cellar to retrieve wine for guests. Watching them to flips and turns in mid-air made it feel like dinner and a movie! I totally recommend trying this place - you'll leave with a smile on your face!
