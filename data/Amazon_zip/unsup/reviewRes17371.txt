Another Kleiner creation. Carnivale is a new Latino restaurant that brings in flavors from Mexico, Brazil, Colombia, and Puerto Rico to name a few. I went to the pre-opening party and had a blast. This establishment used to be The Drink, a club that has been closed for quite some time. I didnt know what to expect but the decor is fantastic. Very latino: bright colors and spacious seating. Beautiful pictures of beautiful Latinos decorate the walls, along with nice artwork. The food samplings I had were great. I will be going back for a full service meal but from what I saw on Tuesday this restaurant will definitely be a hit.
