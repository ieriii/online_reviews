I'm sure this would have been a 4 star review if we had actually had food brought to the table. But we had a very surreal experience with the service that borders on traumatic. I was so excited to go here. We were seated at the same time with another young couple at a large table and the waitress promptly took their order and spread before them a sumptuous array of kim chee. My date made the apparenly tragic misstep of asking for a few more minutes and the waitress seemed to banish us from her consciousness. She'd come to the table to check in with or neighbors, but refused to make eye contact with us or acknowlege us at all. We flagged down another waitress who wrote our order on her hand and disappeared. We were there for about 30 minutes with no kim chee, no offer of drinks or water, and no eye contact / recognition from any of the many waitstaff. Considering that my date is diabetic and his blood sugar was dropping, this was an extra bad feeling. Beyond that, everyone in the restaurant seemed to be feasting around us, and the smoke from their grilling was perfuming our very existence. I started wondering if I was wearing colors that in Korean culture are considered a bad omen. I was wondering if there were apparitions of ghosts above our heads, creating a black cloud of doom that warned the waitresses, Stay Away. After 30 minutes of this, we walked out unfed and heavily scented with Korean B-B-Q smoke, and proceeded to argue in the parking lot about whose fault it was that we didn't get service. I thought it was his because he was a little gruff when he asked for a few more minutes. He thought it was mine because I was 'sitting the wrong way' at our low table. We left and went to L. Woods Pine Lodge to heal our culture shock with what turned out to be a 1/2 price bottle of Malbec, a very tasty meal and amazing service. I still want to go back to San Goob Gab Sann and am wondering if I should do so in a wig and sunglasses like a NY Times food critic.
