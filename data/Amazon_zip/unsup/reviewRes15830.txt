This used to be my favorite place in the city but went there for dinner the other night...what happened? Food was ridiculously salty, I couldn't eat it. The guacamole was good. We got an empanada which now has Indian flavors like curry etc. Their old version was much better. The pork shoulder was the worst of all, thank goodness I only split that with someone. They used to have this delicious braised pork dish with spanish olives but took it off the menu, it made me sad, I ordered it every time without a doubt. I had a coconut mojito which was so-so, a little weird after taste...and then a wine flight which was mediocre too. And get this--I learned something. Apparently you are not allowed to have more than one drink per person at your table according to Illinois law! I asked her to bring my wine flight so it could open up while I was finishing some apps...didn't really want to chug my mojito or let them take it away half full...and was told no. I was like...um...why...and was told that. Anyone else given the same reason? Oh and then pineapple coconut cakes was very tasty, prob the highlight of the meal.
