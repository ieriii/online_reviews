What can I say? I love going to Nana! Not just for the food, but because of the location (it is about 5 min. away from my house), the service, and the overall experience. I have been to this restaurant many times, and each time I love it more and more. We've been there so often that the son of Nana knows us. It's so great that there is a place like this in the beautiful south side of Chicago. Just go and try everything. I've enjoyed all breakfast, lunch, and dinner meals! It's hard for me to pin-point which foods to try.
