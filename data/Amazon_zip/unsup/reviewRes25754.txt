I wanted so much to write a better review for Pequod's because the concept of caramelized crust is genius and speaks right to my heart. I don't know why it's not the default for every pizza place. Unfortunately however, the service was absolutely terrible. I went before a movie across the street, on a slow night, and we ended up needing to go to the next showing because it took so long for the food to arrive. And our waitress forgot to put in our appetizer orders so they weren't ready until well after the pizza (and after we were already full of course). In the end, pretty great pizza, bad experience.
