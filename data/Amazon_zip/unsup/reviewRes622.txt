This place is an experience everyone should have at least once. The service was exceptional, the food unique and delicious. My favorites were the pea soup, green tea dessert, and the bacon with caramel. I was joking around with the waiter about getting an empty vessel instead of the bacon and they brought the whole table out another round! The wine pairings were perfect. My only complaint would be that the final dessert--the art on the mat--had too much overpowering mint in it. Overall, an amazing experience.
