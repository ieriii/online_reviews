A friend of mine from out of town loves the Romanian culture and he found this place. I couldn't be happier that we came here. The owner was interactive and friendly. I sat at their new bar and the owner gave me a shot of Palinka (Romanian Brandy) for free which is delicious by the way. My friend and I wanted to try several of the meals so we split them. We got 4 appetizers and 4 full meals. All the food was delicious. From the smoked salmon, duck, beef stew, steak, stuffed cabbage and more. This was some of the best tasting food I've ever had. Good sized portions as well. We tried some Romanian beer, liquor and wine. All was wonderful and they also carry an ecletic range of domestic and import spirits. There are new servers, a new bar, and they are going to start bring in artists and performers on a weekly basis. I'll definitely be going again. Depending on the time of day you want to go here it caters to many crowds. I also read that this place doesn't have a TV. Maybe it didn't used to but it does now. It's a nice HDTV in the bar area.
