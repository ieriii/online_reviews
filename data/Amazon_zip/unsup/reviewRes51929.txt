In town for a business trip and had to get some Chicago deep dish pizza. Saw this place on Man v. Food and figured I would give it a try. Ordered the meat lovers deep dish, honestly the picture you see on TV doesn't do justice to the gooey-ness of of cheese and the goodness that it is. Although I favor NY style pizza better, this is the best deep dish pizza I have yet to try. The wait was a little long since this place is always crowded, however the atmosphere and the environment with all the writing on the walls and the celebrity pictures is worth the wait IMO. I would def come back and have a deep dish pizza here next time I'm in Chicago. A word of advice, ask the waiter the sizes because your eyes will definitely be bigger than your stomachs when you wait, and then walk into the smell. Control yourself!
