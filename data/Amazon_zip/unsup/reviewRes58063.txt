Watch out for the salt. Having lived in china for four years, I was very excited to try this restaurant. I ordered take-out: ma po tofu and szechuan green beans.The ingredients and presentation were perfect, but the chef was way too heavy handed with the salt.  I literally could not eat my meal.  I rinsed everything and started over.  And i'm a salt person. I hope the chef sees this and reconsiders his liberal application of seasoning.
