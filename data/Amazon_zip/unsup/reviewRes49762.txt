Me want ENTRANA, Give me ENTRANA........ Opphs, sorry I was still in my Las Tablas Entrana Zombie Mode. I would think after going to this restaurant, I wouldn't want steak for awhile. But my oh my, the sauce and the ENTRANA was skirt steak heaven. After reading all the reviews on Yelp, I already knew what I wanted. So I skipped merrily to the restaurant with coupons in one hand and boyfriend on the other. The place look relatively nice, with dim lighting and a medieval feel to it. I felt like I was in an episode of Xena warrior princess. And who doesn't love Xena? Am I right here! But anyways, I got the Entrana of course and the boyfriend copied me. When it came out, it was a long piece of skirt steak about 12 inches. It came with yuca potatoes, potatoes and plantains. Mmmmh, delicious. But the sauce was the icing on top. The chimicurri sauce is where's the money's at. At first, I was a fool, I only wanted to use a little so it doesn't overwhelm my meat. But sadly, I was put in my place when i realized this was the barbecue sauce to my barbecue chicken. Except this was chimicurri sauce on steak. Man, I loaded this baby up. Every bite was perfect. So dear Yelp reader, please use the sauce or I will haunt your dreams. Now I just wished I bought more coupons... Whomp Whomp!
