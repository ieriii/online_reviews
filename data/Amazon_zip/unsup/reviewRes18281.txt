They need to improve the ambiance, especially with the music selection. We went there during the week. The music was awful, I don't know what to call it (country rock?) and way too loud. It was not at all romantic or relaxing and took away from the potential intimacy of the restaurant. The food was above average and the price was reasonable, especially considering the BYOB with no corkage fee. I did not think the bread was even fresh however.  I'm not sure we would return.
