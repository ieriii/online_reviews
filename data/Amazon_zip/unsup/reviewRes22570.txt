This place is nothing short of stellar if you ask this humble reviewer. Costa Rican cuisine has never come to life so vibrantly in Chicago as it has here I think. Their food is always well seasoned and balances CR flavors nicely. The oatmeal shakes are incredible, and the empanada's are mandatory for our party. I've been to the central part of this Costa Rica on Vacation, and I think Irazu rival's any local restaurant we've come across. I just discovered Irazu about a month ago and I've already dined with you 7 times! Do I have a problem that I need to consult someone about?  BYOB, $10 to $15 entrees, but only $5 sandwiches(which are filling and amazing). Excellent atmosphere and service, and the food is the best!
