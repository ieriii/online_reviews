Right across from ENO which is a favorite of mine - this was a fun stop as well. We were looking for a little snack and a glass of wine and this fit the bill. We enjoyed the beets with goat cheese and a lovely wine from Greece that our waiter recommended (nice call!!). We had the pleasure of sitting out side, but the indoor decor was nice. I was a little disappointed that a few items I was interested were not available, although the comment was made that they did not turn out as the chef hopped, so perhaps I was saved from a bad experience. Give this place a try!
