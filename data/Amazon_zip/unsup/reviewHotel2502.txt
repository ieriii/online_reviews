Before I moved to Chicago, I stayed at the Hilton & Towers twice. Each experience was very enjoyable -- and comfortable beyond belief! Normally, I'm the type of person who is hauling her pillow around place to place, and for the first time ever I didn't need to use my own because the hotel pillows were perfect! Our room was super sized, including two full sized, separate bathrooms. It was very cozy, and I'd definitely recommend it.
