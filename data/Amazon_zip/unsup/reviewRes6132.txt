Really like this addition to the neighborhood, it is Italian but pulls away from the expected and ubiquitous fare one can easily find at any Italian resto.  Theyre cocktail specials are nice too, they would get me to come back.  The food was overall really nice. Nothing too mind blowing, just simple, rustic food. Although they did use aerosol whipped cream on the desserts, kinda scary. Is it that hard to whip cream??  Totally will go back though, the menu is large and diverse...much more to explore!!!
