This place is very unusual. It's a converted warehouse (former fish market) that is quite gaudy (walls painted in bright colored stripes; humongous lampshades in brightly colored stripes and polka dots). The service is professional, friendly and very attentive. The food was pretty good. I had the guacamole, which I thought would be amazing from yelpers, but it was OK, needed more kick (lime, garlic?); the best part were the chips, which were thick but light. I had the 3-item ceviche which was beautifully presented and delicious, generous serving. The macaroni and cheese was somewhat misleading; it was more like alfredo (rigatoni with rich cream sauce and breadcrumbs; no gooey cheese). And it's very loud (high volume recorded latin music in dining area, and adjacent you could here the competing music from the saxophone/trumpet/trombone/congo drums amplified music). Acoustics are really bad. It's all just very busy (think Circus Circus with a Steve Wynn touch, sorta Cirque du Soleil without the Quebecois touch). My meal was $40, so it was reasonable, I thought. Oh yeah, it sorta bothered me that the waitresses wore all-black button-down dress shirts, ties, slacks and shoes, but when you walk in the men's room the walls are plastered with women baring breasts (yes, the nipples are shown). It sorta creeped me out. I know, they're trying for the Carnivale thing, but the heavy-effort theming didn't all quite work. Honestly, it is too loud (acoustically and visually) to really enjoy the food and fine service. And it doesn't feel particularly Latin. I just wish the surrounding were toned down a bit so the food could take center stage. P.S. Regarding yelpers' comments about dress code, which didn't ever occur to me - - there were diners in jeans and flip-flops, adding to the whole anything-goes tacky Vegas feel. PPS Friendly manager. Extremely limited vegetarian options.
