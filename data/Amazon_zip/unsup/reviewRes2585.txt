first time here; waiting in line it WAS worth the wait even though we hadn't eaten all day. the atmosphere waiting in line was fun, some loud crazy people & the atmosphere in the place was nice & relaxed. the menu seems gourmet, but it wasn't over-done. i loved my dog!! i had a chili, cheese & caramelized(i specified) onions. it was super yummy & i really loved the chili. the TOTS were good a bit salty but i dont mind that.
