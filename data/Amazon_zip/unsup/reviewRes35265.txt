You only need to say three words to have the great dinner experience: Peking duck dinner! You get a three course meal that can feed 3 to 4 people. It comes with juicy slices of duck breast meat with buns, duck fried rice, and wintermelon with duck broth. I really enjoyed the sweet soup because the flavors were not overwhelming and it was very refreshing.  I also ordered a shrimp dumpling wonton noodle soup with five spiced marinaded beef tripe. The noodles and dumpling were very tasty however I wasn't really into the flavor of the tripe.  They need to expand to Chinatown!
