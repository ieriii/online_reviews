BBQ in the Gold Coast? I was a little skeptical when we came for a birthday but became a quick convert because; - complimentary BBQ chips and sweet pickles. They must put crack in these! We couldn't stop eating them! The best part is that they keep coming. Our table must have eaten 4 bowls easy. Any places that keeps the food coming is tops in my book. - delicious shrimp and grits. Took a friend from the South here and she raved about the home-made grits - decent portions for the price. Don't be fooled by the decor or location - they're real generous with the portions!
