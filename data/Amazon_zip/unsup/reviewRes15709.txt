The food is good. I love the steak but the side dish of mushroom and carrots was way too salty. The valet parking is the worst! The sign says $5 but the valet parker is charging $10. They dont drive your car with care. Look for parking outside restaurant on the street! The parking lot charges $7 for 2 hours.
