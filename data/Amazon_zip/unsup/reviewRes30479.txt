I won't say I didn't know what to expect when I walked through the doors of the Chicago Diner, because I did, but I really didn't. Put another way, I didn't know exactly how much of a scene it would be. I normally don't like scenes, but I liked this place, its neighborhood, and even the 25-minute wait that gave Esther and me a chance to walk around (even though it was relatively cold) and catch up on stories of Chicago adventures old and new. The food is pretty amazing. I don't say that lightly, and I especially don't say that lightly regarding vegetarian restaurants. I'm generally pretty easy to please at a place where I can eat anything on the menu, but I know that other people's taste buds aren't as forgiving as mine, so I usually warn them about all things over-hyped, overrated, and generally overplayed. The Chicago Diner's food is none of these things. Yes, it is diner fare. There are interesting things on the menu that you may have never tried before, but if you're vegetarian or vegan, it's a lot of the usual substitute suspects. But they're done really well, and the menu is pretty extensive. The service is excellent. It was crowded, but our server was always checking on us, and she was genuinely friendly and interested in actually having a conversation with us, all of this while excusing herself when she had to go run some food out. I always like knowing that my comfort isn't coming at another customer's expense. It seems a little bit expensive, at least by what I remember of Chicago standards (living in San Francisco skews one's perception of what is affordable, reasonable, and exorbitant); but I'm only in the Windy City once a year, so I don't mind spending money to support such a wonderful place. I'd give it five stars, but it's completely wheelchair inaccessible. As soon as they fix that oversight, I'm bumping it up.
