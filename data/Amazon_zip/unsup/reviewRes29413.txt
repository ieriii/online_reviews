Of all the dining options in Lincoln Park, I would say that Pasta Bowl is the one that I most frequent. Never fails to provide a really good (and very inexpensive) meal. The farfalle pollo is so good that it's really hard for me not to order it when I come here. I have managed to branch out a few time, and everything I've had has been amazing--and, most of the time, the portions are large enough for 2 meals (ok, so maybe 1.5). I went there last night and had the gorgonzola pasta dish--AWESOME. The dining room is relatively small, but the service is fast and I've never had much of a problem with a wait. Coming from a guy who doesn't necessarily prefer italian food, the Pasta Bowl has made me a fan!
