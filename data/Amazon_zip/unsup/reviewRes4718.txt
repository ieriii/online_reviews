How could I have not written a review for my beloved Purple Pig? One of my favorite spots in the city, and a must-go when any friends or family are in town visiting. They had me at hello with their appreciation for everything pig. I'm having a hard time getting this review going - just trust me when I say EVERYTHING here is good. Everything. The decor, the outdoor seating, the wait staff, the bartenders, the beer and wine selection, and the FOOD. Everything is perfection. The menu is always changing, but I'll review some of their staples. pork fried almonds - seems so simple, but was life changing. anything from the fried section - pick your pleasure. Fried cheese. Fried pig ear. Fried Sardines. Fried olives (no thanks, but olive lovers loved 'em). purple pig platter of cured meats - a must for a group table. The fuet and jamon serrano are my favorites. CHEESE - always an amazing selection of cheese. Just tell them what you like and they'll pick out a selection to suit your taste. bone marrow - don't think, just do it. Dessert - the Sicilian Iris. "ricotta and chocolate chip filled fried brioche." Incredible. A ridiculous dessert. Perfect with a cup of espresso.
