Fogo de Chao and Sal y Carvao are MUCH better. I've been to Brazzaz twice--each time the meat is fatty and tough, and the service is horrible. I was with a group of 30 one time, and they came around TWICE with meat the ENTIRE NIGHT. We sat there for about 45 minutes with nothing and when we asked them why they weren't coming around anymore, they had no response. Fogo and Sal are the way to go. I'm partial to Fogo, but both are fantastic.
