my cousin somehow managed to keep her wedding on the small side. when you are dealing with hosting relatives from overseas in india, it can be tough with the expectations set in our culutre. i digress. modern without being tacky like IKEA was what we noticed. their banquet room for the wedding reception was on par with the chic lobby, very modern and well decorated. i think if you have a wedding there they do a discounted parking rate and it must be lumped in but i heard its otherwise fairly expensive to park your car. we didn't have to worry about it though. the service was great but i am not sure if it is consistent with four star service, still good though. the rooms were cramped and our view was pointing towards an office tower. what matters for us when we stay a night at a hotel is the cleanliness and quality of service. for weddings i am rating them five stars and for the room itself size-wise i am giving them three stars.
