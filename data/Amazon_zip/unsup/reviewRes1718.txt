After a recent trip to Hot Doug's (after our first one failed due to 3hr long lines....not even exaggerating), we felt we owed this place an extensively long review lavishly extolling the virtues of their hot dogs. In fact, after we had finished devouring our meal, we could not bring ourselves to call what this establishment served as hot dogs....they were really the very physical embodiment of culinary talent that happened to be in the form of encased meat. However, a simple glimpse on yelp revealed that such an effort would simply be as redundant. The other 1200 reviews are enough to demand that anyone who has not been here do so. Yes, the lines can be long, but if done correctly (we came on a Thursday at 1pm and we only waited 20 minutes), it can be tolerable. So what are you waiting for?  Btw, for the sake of completeness, this is what we had, all of which were amazingly delicious: 1. The Dog (chicago style hotdog with everything) 2. The Elvis (polish sausage) 3. The Paul Kelly (Bratwurst) 4. The Eliot Fishman (Brandy-Infused Portuguese Chorizo with Saffron Rouille and Iberico Cheese) 5. Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage with Truffle Aioli, Foie Gras Mousse and Fleur de Sel 6. Pear-infused elk sausage with Foie Gras Dijonnaise and Mustard-seed Gouda Cheese All topped with a large serving of fries. Heaven.
