I can't say enough good things about this place. There's real bang for your buck - the food is excellent, and the decor is sophisticated, but there are some really reasonably priced menu items. The level of service is much higher than what you would expect for the price. The free chips they give everyone are the perfect blend of tangy and sweet. Everything my bf and I have tried here is delicious! Its a gem!
