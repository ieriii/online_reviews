I am very fortunate to live so close to this restaurant. The portions are small, but you leave pretty satisfied.  I got the pork belly + apple mostarda, as well as the Riccio di Mare e Granchio.  I would highly recommend this pasta if you're a fan of uni and/or if you're wanting something that is not too saucy. It was delicious.
