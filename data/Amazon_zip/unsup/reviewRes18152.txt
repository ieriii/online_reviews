SEVEN IPAs on draft! That is a lot of strong, hoppy beer for me to try to get through in one sitting. I only made it through six (with a burger in the middle), so my night went like this: - Bear Republic Racer 5    (7%) - Founders All Day IPA     (4.7%) - Tyranena Scurvy IPA      (6.5%) --------------------------------------------------- Red Dragon burger topped with brisket hash, over easy egg, pepper jack, and roasted red pepper sauce. Side of truffle fries. DELICIOUS! --------------------------------------------------- - Founders Centennial IPA   (7.2%) - Founders Double Trouble  (7.6%) - Half Acre Daisy Cutter    (5.2%) After a run like this, there is only one thing you can do: GO HOME AND GO TO BED. You've peaked - you're night will not get any better then the previous four hours of hoppy, burgery, truffely bliss.
