The pho is good (but not as good as Pho 777), and they are open on Tuesday.  Three problems: the service, the cleanliness, and the price. Even grading on the Argyle curve, the service here is particularly bad. The place is dingy. You have to hunt through the stack of spoons to find one that doesn't have crud caked on it. I'm glad they switched to disposable, wooden chopsticks -- at least they are clean. This place costs about a dollar a bowl more than all the other pho places.
