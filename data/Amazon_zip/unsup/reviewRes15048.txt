I had high expectations based on the reviews, but it just did not measure up. Atmosphere is very tasteful and chill - loved that! The drinks, however, were OK at best. In fact, only one person at my table liked his drink. Several other Yelpers noted to "rude" or "aloof" staff - and I would agree. Service wasn't terrible, but the crew at my local McDonalds is much more pleasant to be around. I did not appreciate the mandatory gratuity added to our check. Nowhere on the menu did it say that gratuity would be added, nor did our waiter inform us of it. Seems a little deceptive. Definitely would not return.
