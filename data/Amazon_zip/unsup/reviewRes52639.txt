This place is good. It's probably the second best Brazilian steakhouse. It's good and the service is really great as well. It's just the meat isn't as good as it is at Fogo. It is a bit different than other Brazilian steakhouses since it has shrimp and pineapple. Which are really great as well. Also whenever I've been there they always give me a little survey to fill out then they give me a 25 dollar gift certificate which is really nice of them.
