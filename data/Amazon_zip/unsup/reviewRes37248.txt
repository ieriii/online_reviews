For awhile this was my Friday night hangout. Reasons to love: 1. Great mix of people. No pretention. No specific age range. You can dress up or down and it's all good. 2. Beer selection is fantastic. 3. The food is amazing. I usually get the mussels and pommes frites every time I go. The frites come with an amazing mayo sauce on the side. CAN'T GET ENOUGH!! 4. If the downstairs gets too crowded there is an upstairs bar. And if you're just in the mood to eat, there is a restaurant area. Simply love the atmosphere, the staff and the food! If you want a low-key, easy going, not a dive, not inundated with F-me boots and no sign of hipster mustaches place, this is it. (Caveat - there may be one or two hipster mustaches. Even hipsters gotta eat.)
