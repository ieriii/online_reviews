I went here for the first time this past weekend. We got there on a Saturday at 6pm and had no problem getting a table...by 7pm the place was packed! We had the taste of Cuba for an appetizer and I had the Almond Crusted Halibut. The appetizer was good, but I didn't expect everything on it to be fried. The fish was AMAZING! My friend got the honey jalapeno pork chops....which were big enough to feed a family of four! The were good and the sweet potatoes that came with the pork chops were 'to die for.' Would love to go back for the brunch that everyone raves about. The service was also wonderful.
