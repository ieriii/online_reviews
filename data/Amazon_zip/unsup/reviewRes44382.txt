This place is so cute! Came here last night with the BF and everything was delightful. The place, the service, and the food! We ordered the wakakmono roll, the mango, the emerald, and the sweet potato. All were delicious. We ordered a bottle of Riesling that was actually French White Wine. It was still very good. We skipped out on the dessert because we were stuffed, but definitely plan to go back. I can't wait to try the other special rolls and appetizers. It's BYOB-friendly!
