I've been oinking about The Pig to anyone who would care to listen. It has become my go-to recommended place to anyone I know. I don't even care if they have any history of heart ailments. I just say go to Purple Pig. At least you die happy. Why wouldn't you be? Anything with this much pork fat just spells T-A-S-T-Y. Their pig's ears with crispy kale is tantamount to gastronomic orgasm. Add the bone marrow pate and I'm in arterial clogging heaven. And screw all the "That's so unhealthy!" remarks said in aghast. That's what red wine is for. If a glass is good for the heart, imagine what a decanter would do! I would have given The Pig five OINKS if it were not for the wait time. I count it by the wine glass and I would average four glasses before getting seated. More so during weekend dinners.
