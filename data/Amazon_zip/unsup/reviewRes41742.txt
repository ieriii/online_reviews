Tank is my go-to Pho spot on a cold winter day. The food is good, the price is cheap and it's BYOB. Plus it is walking distance to my abode. I usually get a huge bowl of Pho with thinly sliced raw beef served on the side. The Pho is served with all the trimmings: bean sprouts, basil leaves, cilantro, jalapeno peppers, wedge of fresh lime. All tables are stocked with: soy, garlic paste, sriracha, oyster sauce, etc... For appetizers, the spring rolls are good but I really like the crispy pancake with shrimp and sprouts. I usually go with my girlfriend and we get outta there for under $20 every time. If you are looking for cheap eats I would recommend Tank.
