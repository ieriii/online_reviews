I finally made it to Piece! Every time I intended to go there it was too busy and would have to wait like an hour for a table to eat their delicious pizza!  So my bf suggested we go on a Sunday afternoon--lucky for us there were only a few tables taken and it was a delightfully sunny day. We ordered the tomato-spinach dip to start. They give you a generous portion of that, but I could have used some more chips to scoop out the rest. We then decided on a "red" pizza and added sauteed mushrooms.    We ordered a medium and it was more than enough for two people--we took a couple slices home. The thing that I liked best about the pizza is that unlike many other thin crust pizzas, the pizza at Piece had a nice crunchy crust. So many others have a soggy crust and the pizza just falls apart. The service was good, but then again how could it not be if we were one of like six tables? Our server was attentive with the drinks and our food was nice and hot when it came out. I am sooo happy I finally was able to try Piece!
