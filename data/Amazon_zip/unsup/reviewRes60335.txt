I LOVE this place. It is by far one of my favorite sushi restaurants in the city. The staff isn't the friendliest but it's okay because I don't go there for the service, I go there for the sushi!Their Godzilla roll is a guilty pleasure of mine. It's technically not really sushi, it doesn't have anything raw in it! It's just shrimp tempura, crab, some eel sauce and some other sauces...and avocado I think? Anyways, it's delicious and you should try it.I also love their tuna sampler platter that they have where you get Fatty Tuna, Maguro, and White Tuna. It's nice to taste them side by side and good for people who don't know the difference. I personally find the white tuna the best. It's creamy and the fish always seems to be fresh here.I also tried their Mexican roll which I thought I would love but found that I didn't like it so much. It honestly just had way too much clinatro in it.
