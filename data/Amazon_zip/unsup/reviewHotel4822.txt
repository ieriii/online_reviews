This was the second time we have stayed at this hotel. This time with our 22 month old child. We got a great deal on the hotel using Priceline's name your own price. In addition we used the Facebook Word of the Week to get free internet for one day (which we didn't use anyway) and a significantly reduced rate on parking. The hotel is really in a great location for the type of activities we like to do. Due to a need to have milk for our child I called ahead to see what we could do regarding a fridge for the room. They informed me that when we check in just to mention that we had a child so we needed the crib and fridge and we were not charged for either. In addition, they had no problem giving us our choice of two beds or one king. Several hotels in the past when using priceline make no special requests like this. I definitely recommend this hotel.
