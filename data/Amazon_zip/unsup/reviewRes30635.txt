I heard good things about this place, and when you have higher expectations of a place, it's alot harder to reach them, and this place exceeded those expectations.  This place doubles as dinner and a nice start-up place for the evening. As with most nice places we had to wait, even with a reservations for about 5-10 minutes. The service was pretty solid, even though the place was packed. The drinks were decent, but on the small side and the food was really good. We had some appetizers, rolls, and some dessert. The food was freshly made and the proper attention was given. My only problem was that it was so crowded AND they were playing music pretty loudly that it was a couple of octaves higher than I like to have it when I eat. All-in-all a good place for an intimate night or a group of folks
