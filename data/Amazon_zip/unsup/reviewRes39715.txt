On a whim last night I decided to check out this new Logan Square bar/restaurant with two of my friends. From the second we sat down, our service was absolutely exemplary. For starters we were offered our choice of either still or sparkling water (we chose sparkling). I spent close to 14 years in the service industry and I have to say our busboy was one of the best I've ever seen. Not only did my water glass NEVER get below half full, but he was also exceptionally enthusiastic about the establishment, and had such nice things to say about all the menu items. It made choosing my entree all the more difficult because he'd already made everything sound soooo good! Our waiter, Willy Duncan was awesome! He gave us a thorough run down of the drink choices, and suggested some dangerously great beers and whiskey. The selection of $3 whiskey shots is both amazing AND a recipe for trouble of the best variety. As an appetizer, we started out with a scallop soup that had some sort of creme fresh and was infused with sunflower oil....everything on the menu was so ornate and the attention to the detail in the food really shined through with every bite. For entrees I chose the veal cutlet atop brussel sprouts with beef cheeck mannicotti. Just writing this right now sends shivers of happiness through my whole body. I'm not even kidding here, but for the first time in my life, i find myself savoring a meal the next morning. I cannot wait to go back! Aside from the amazing food, you should also stop by their 7" jukebox to see what may be the best 7" jukebox in the entire world. I mean seriously....Brainiac's Internationale 7"? King Khan? Kurt Vile? Nirvana's Sliver/Iodine? Bob & Gene? It's like someone raided my dream 7" collection and put it into a jukebox. Outstanding. This place makes me happy to be alive.
