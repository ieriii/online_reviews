I've now been to Publican for Dinner and for Brunch. I was impressed both times!!! For dinner there are lots of options, some favorites were the fries with a fried egg and the pork belly. Everything we had was delicious! We just went to brunch today and it was fabulous. We started off with the maple bacon, it was the most delicious bacon I've ever had...it's a must! We also had the pretzel with cheese which was very good. We started off with those as appetizers with bloody marys. I have to say they get extra points for giving you a side car beer with your bloody!! I had the pork belly (loved it so much at dinner I had to try the breakfast version), it was great, spicy and had Korean spicy cabbage. Everyone ordered a different brunch item and I'm convinced that you couldn't make a bad decision as all 4 of ours were amazing.  Must Order: Bacon! Tip: Make sure you make a reservation, also tables outside are first come first serve with reservation
