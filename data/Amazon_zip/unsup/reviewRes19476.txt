Great sushi joint I have to say. An ex of mine introduced me to this place and since then, it's been one of my top places to get some quality sushi. ....And not to mention a great place to take a date, well actually more than a couple dates. =/ My favorites: Volcano, Sunrise, Coast Crab and Maine Maki signature dishes. And also the fact that its BYOB. Off the chain folks. Off. The. Chain.
