If they delivered or had another restaurant in Rogers Park it would get more stars, but with small space to eat and having to drive to the area, it gets 3. The Burrito's are awesome, even warmed up if your friend can't finish them, the fries are also awesome. The buffallo wings are your usual fan fare. If I'm ever in the area and looking for chicken wings this would be the place to be, otherwise you can probably find something closer to you.
