I came here and ordered from one of the waiters. I waited like 15 minutes and it never came. I never got any water on a scorching hot day. I got some from another waiter and asked about my food. She said it was coming. It never came. Apparently the first waiter was still training and didn't get the order in.  I decided to give this place another try the next week. I walked in, and the waiter who didn't put my order in on my last visit recognized me and apologized profusely. It was very and i asked if they had air conditioning. The said there is in the back section. I was led to the back patio, and all they had were floor fans! I ordered food and then went to pick up some rum since this place is byob. I asked the waitress where the nearest liquor store is, and she said I would be able to see CVS from the patio. I walked down the street a couple of blocks and didn't see it. Apparently one can only see the CVS through an alley, but this tidbit was omitted from the directions. When I returned, my food had been sitting out for a while. I ordered a strip steak with plantains. The plantains were fried and greasy but tasty. The strip steak lacked seasoning. What was worth noting was that a pitcher of mojito mix was ten bucks! I'd rather go to a place with air conditioning and pay for 7 bucks or whatever to have my mojitos made for me.
