I still stand by my original 5-star rating. I would like to mention an addition to the phenomenal reviews I gave their service last time. This time, when we were here, we were casually discussing how amazing the chocolate cake shakes from Portillos were. Our server must have overheard our conversation, because he went back to the kitchen, told the chef about our conversation who then proceeded to whip up complimentary chocolate cake shakes (that are not even on the menu) for our table. You can only imagine our surprise and appreciation when we realized what happened.  This is the kind of service that makes Mastro's stand out in comparison to other steak houses and fine dining establishments in the city. This is why I will always go back and tell all my friends about it.
