I ate here in October and had the 5 course pre-fixe menu: deconstructed caesar, butternut squash soup, scallops, wagyu beef and smores. Out of all those tastes, the dish that stuck out in my mind was the amuse bouche: foie-lipops: foie gras with watermelon pop rocks After a taste like that (a surprisingly decent combination), I felt that the rest of the meal was lacking originality. Service was attentive and not overly aggressive. Setting was laid back and dress was casual.
