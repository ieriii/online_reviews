Came here during a trip to Chicago with a friend. Didn't have reservations on a Saturday evening, so we just showed up at 5pm when the restaurant opened and got a table. We had a great server - Whitney - who happily guided us through the menu options. Originally we were going to go for the 5-course tasting menu as the others had dishes that would not have worked with me due to allergies, but the restaurant still had substitutes for me, so we went for the 10-course Collection menu. Before the actual dining experience we had read about the foie gras lollipops which were not on the menu, so we ordered it. Oh yeah, it really came in a lollipop form, with watermelon-flavored pop rocks around it. That was definitely something new (and tasty)! Now for the actual Collection menu. Some favorites: - Pumpkin soup: it would have been tastier if I followed Whitney's instructions to slowly mix everything so the flavor would come through, but nevertheless it was YUM. - Caesar salad: whoa. That was definitely an interpretation. Normally anchovies are not my thing, but hey, it was a good mix. - Foie gras: mixed with huckleberries and buckwheat bread. miam miam. - Scallops: with popovers - who knew that would work great? - Chicken (hen): came with a pre-dish thing with matsutake shavings, and then the main course - with more matsutake! - Wagyu: it's wagyu. How can't you not like it? So after this we took a long, long walk back to the hotel. I don't think we worked it off... So with top-notch service and great food, I'll be back.
