Have been here 4-5 times once for brunch. Our most recent visit was last Friday night. Laura was our waitress the past two visits and she is just a joy. The food is overall good and very good for brunch. Top picks are the gumbo, fried okra and cornbread (which is complementary but has come out at very end of our meal-??). Fried green tomatoes are good but the sauce a little rich and heavy. Will probably have it on the side next time. Service can be slow and they seem short handed especially on busy weekend nights, but the staff tries their best and that seems to make it okay with us. Will be back.
