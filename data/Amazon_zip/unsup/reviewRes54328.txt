Went here for the first time after reading numerous reviews. I consider myself a pizza afficianado, so the visit was long overdue.Overall I would give the pizza a B-The service was unusual and not your typical friendly encounter, but it wasn't rude either....hard to explain.As for the pizza, I felt the taste of the dough was very good, but the main problem was that the pizza is 75% bread/dough. If you like this, then this place is for you. The sauce is okay and tastes like canned pizza sauce.Also, I feel like you have to get the pizza with meat otherwise the pizza itself is bland because of lack of salt.Positives: not too greasy, not too much cheese like other placesNegatives: too bready
