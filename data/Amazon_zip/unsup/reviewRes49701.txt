HUGE PORTIONS! definately splitable! BYOB so a great place for groups....5 dollar cork fee for wine, but if you bring screwtop (which many nice wines are now...don't laugh) it's free....weird, but I'll take it.  I had the shrimp and pork tenderloin combo and split it and still had leftover....great salad comes with it. Service was not the best but they were as friendly as could be.....that is more important to me than getting all hung up on a salad coming out at the same time as your dinner....this isn't 5 star fancy dining people. Take it for what it is. Great food and a great place for groups....I reccomend highly.....
