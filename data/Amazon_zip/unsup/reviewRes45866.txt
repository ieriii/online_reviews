Big portions...good food... a little of everything for everybody, reminiscent of a Cheesecake Factory sort of way (yet different). Brought a colleague here for a late lunch. We were starving and Grand Lux was the first place that came to mind, as we were downtown. I had a scrumptious Bento Box lunch meal, that I've never had before. Our fabulous server Francisco had recommended it to me. It had: *Plate of asparagus *Caesar salad *Choice of soup - I went for Chicken tortilla, yum! *Chicken Saltimbocca Great portion - - all for only $14.95! And I believe my colleague had some Chicken Alfredo that he said was delicious. Naturally, we were too full this time to partake in desserts. But Grand Lux is the kinda place for some good slightly upscale comfort food.
