The food at Indie is very good. I've had the Basil Chicken several times, and it was nice and spicy. You can substitute brown rice, which is a great option. The Asparagus Gold appetizer, with the shrimp and bit of bacon, is tasty if a little naughty. My vegetarian friends love this place, too. My only complaint is with the service. While everyone is extremely nice, something has been missed or confused every time I've been to Indie. The mistakes are always corrected and I've never been over-charged, but be aware that you may have language issues with the servers. Just double-check your order, and everything should be fine.
