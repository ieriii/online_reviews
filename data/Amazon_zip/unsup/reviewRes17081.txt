Wow - great Latin food. A large group went on business, and we were all impressed by the various dishes. I especially enjoyed the "Latin sushi". I had a seared tuna entree that was fantastic - the tuna just melted in my mouth. Four stars because it's quite pricey - not quite up to my budget, because my family doens't appreciate fine dining like I do.
