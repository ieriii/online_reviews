By 6:30pm, the place was densely populated as a top tiered restaurant in River North. Men in suits and women in high heels. This was the Sunda that I was expecting. The maki roll selection wasn't anything out of the ordinary. The combinations were creative but nothing spectacular. As a top tiered sushi restaurant, the quality of the fish, rice, and presentation was top notch - including the prices. With the prices, you get a loud atmosphere surrounded by good looking people. Everyone was dressed to impress. It makes sense though. When was the last time you saw someone wearing raggedy clothes while eating sushi? For the casual dining experience, come between 5-7:00pm for the half off sushi. Take note, it does not apply for the dining area but is only available at the bar and lounge. If you are here for the environment and cocktails, come after 6:00pm and wear your Sunda(y) best.
