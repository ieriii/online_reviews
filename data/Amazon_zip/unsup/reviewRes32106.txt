This place is sambus-tastic! Like many others below, I went on a recent Groupon. I had thought the restaurant would be grateful to have us there, and so was surprised to find that they almost couldn't seat our non-reservation-heinies. But they found a great table for us and our service could not -- could not -- have been better. I highly recommend the sampler plates (the messobs). This way, you can get tastes of various things without committing. This is especially helpful if you are new to Ethiopian food. Quick note - desserts here blow, so don't bother. We tried two of them and both were prepare without thought, using prepared, store-bought ingredients.
