I am in town once a year, and I always manage to go to the Violet Hour. When I am away, I miss it. Los Angeles may never discover what it is missing. The food is a bit heavy, so I stick to the drinks. When I am with friends, I'm obligated to sit at tables, but I prefer the bar service. The waitresses are well-meaning, but a hassle to deal with at times. My last visit, I had a wicked egg white and chartreuse concoction created for me by Patrick, who is also a lovely conversationalist. No phones, high back chairs, candlelight and bartenders fluent in the art of conversation. We should be so lucky to have something like this in every city.
