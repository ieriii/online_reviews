I haven't stayed at the James Hotel but I've been there for a few events and it is a wonderful hotel. It's extremely stylish and has a very modern feel to it. The staff is very helpful and they are very accomodating- especially for private parties/events. I have heard that the guest rooms are very nice too and if you have the chance to stay here you definitely should!
