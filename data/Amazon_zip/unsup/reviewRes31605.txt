I've been back to Nana twice since my last review, and I've really wanted to like it. However, today confirmed that it's just...not that good. The food remains fresh but is overpriced, even for organic quality.  The service is a disaster.  While I understand the "cool" factor of our waiter not writing down orders, I'd prefer that if you can't remember it that you go ahead and write it down. Both my friend and I received incorrect food and were treated as inconveniences for asking that they fix their mistakes.  Getting a second cup of coffee? Forget about it, unless you can catch the one busser who was trying to be productive. I hope that Nana can get it together, because in theory they are a wonderful addition to Bridgeport. Until then, you'll find me elsewhere.
