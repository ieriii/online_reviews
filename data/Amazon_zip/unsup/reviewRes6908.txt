I can't believe all the rave reviews for a place that was just OK. If I had friends tell me they were going to dinner at Chicago Q, I wouldn't try to stop them, but if someone asked me where they should go for BBQ, Chicago Q wouldn't even enter my mind. The ribs weren't bad, they just weren't good enough to be memorable or spark a desire to return. If I lived across the street I might be tempted to try other items on the menu to see where they really excelled, but since I don't live across the street, I will probably never think about Chicago Q again after I post this review. Ribs - OK Mac & Cheese - OK Cornbread - Very Dry Coleslaw - Good Braised Greens - The ran out?!?!? Ginger Fizz - Tasty!!! Cheesecake - Fantastic. Oddly enough it is one of the best I have had in the city. I would have to say it is second only to Il Mulino which is right next door. Pecan Pie - Eh Key Lime - Good. My dining partners thought it was runny, but I thought it was good. Price - I don't think they were overpriced, I just don't think it was worth my time or the calories. Service - Very Good. It was Mother's Day and even though the server was slammed she didn't miss a beat.
