Have loved it for the five years I have attended. Friendly wait staff and a Lincoln Park favorite that wont break the bank. I always get the Penne Puttanesca with Chicken and it is always delicious. The pesto pasta and the gnocchi half marinara and alfredo are solid. For appetizers, smoked mozzarella with Marinara is awesome too. They have a full bar with lots of imports for beer lovers. I will come here until they won't allow me to be wheeled in from Sunrise Retirement on Clark.
