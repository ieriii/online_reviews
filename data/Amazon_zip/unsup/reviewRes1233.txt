I've been feeling kinda homesick for Chicago and was thinking of putting together a list of my favorites, but while perusing my reviews realized that I never did review a number of my very favorite Chicago places. Probably the most glaring omission is Hot Doug's. People in Reno always ask me if I miss Chicago, and the answer is yes and no. I don't miss the congestion, traffic, expense and the flat, flat landscape. I do miss the shopping, my friends, the live music venues, but mostly I miss the restaurants. Certainly I miss the high end, foodie places like Lula Cafe, but even more I miss the awesome cheap eats that Chicago REALLY excels at. Hot Doug's, to me, marries the best of high end and low end. It's a hot dog joint for certain, but it's elevated to the point of art. Encased meats as art? Hell F***ing YES! Duck Fat Fries. YES, awesome. But the regular fries are spectacular as well. Fancy gourmet confections like lamb and mint dogs with gooey melted cheese. Yes, please. But, I always, always have to have a regular dog with the works Chicago style in addition to everything else. Have to. I have never had a single thing at Hot Doug's that wasn't best of class. And Doug himself is a true gem and grand citizen of Chicago, right up there with Da Mayor himself. I love how when you order a large pop he'll suggest you order a small instead and just get refills if you're eating on the premises. The lines are legendary, but the wait is totally worth it. Go hungry, but not ravenous, because you will probably be waiting an hour or more. By the time you order you will be ravenous, and a fancy selection, a regular dog, large fries and a pop will be the best thing you might ever eat. And now I'm just a little bit more homesick. *tear*
