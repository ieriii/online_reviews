Piece has a great vibe and social scene for a pizza pub...decent place in Hipsterville to chill out and eat some slices...the beer selection is awesome! It is hard to find many good micro-brews in Chi, especially ones that serve good food...Piece may have grabbed this idea from Goose Island's awful attempts at a HQ bar...After the meal, I took a growler and left-over pizza home for the next day! they also allow you to fine tailor your pie to satisfaction with unique topping choices. Waitstaff were cool and helpful and pricing was reasonable for home-brew and pizza. Highly recommend Piece to everybody!
