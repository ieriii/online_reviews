This is my go to place when I'm craving Vietnamese and don't want to make the trek up to Argyle. I've tried a number of items on their menu and everything has been really good, I would especially recommend the beef pho and the chicken dumplings they my favs! The service is always great here and owner is super nice and sweet.Highly recommend this place!
