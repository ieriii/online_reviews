Oh, Revolution. How do I love thee? Let me count the ways. I really dig this place. Their beers are consistently delicious and I only ever order their brews when I gorge myself there. As many have already pointed out, their bacon fat popcorn is truly a thing of great and terrible beauty. This is merely child's play compared to the burgers. When I really feel like treating my body badly, I order the Smokehouse burger-- a yummy patty topped with a generous scoop of pulled pork. So much delicious. I can't wait to try their brunch!
