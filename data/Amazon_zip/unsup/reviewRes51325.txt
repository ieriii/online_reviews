Have had good experiences every time that I have been here. It might not be the best that I have ever had, but it is classic Mexican fare. Like everyone else out there my food always tastes better when I have had more to drink. I think their margaritas are good. I keep ordering the chicken fajitas and will continue to come back when I need my Mexican fix. It isn't your quiet intimate restaurant as it can get quite loud in there. I always have a good time though. It does help that I can stumble home from this place!!
