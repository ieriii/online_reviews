Been here a couple of times and it's really a classic old 1920's style bar. I'm not a smoker, but this place lost some atmosphere when the smoking ban went into effect a couple years back. Some classic jazz names here every so often as well. It wa sad to read K.L.'s review - unfortunately some employees get so focused on dealing with their small world that they lose sight of the big picture. Awhile back, I was there with a few friends and two got up to dance and the staff immediately shut them down. Now, the place probably doesn't have a "dance hall license" so it might be something they have to do, but there rae just better ways to handle some things. Especially at an old time place, where you hope to find "old time hospitality". Another unusual thing at Green Mill is when you step out of the restroom, it almost feels like your onstage. But that's just the way it is - and kinda funny too. I love the character in this place and the groups that play there. My 4 star rating is probably more generous than it should be - I just try to look past the issues and enjoy my time there.
