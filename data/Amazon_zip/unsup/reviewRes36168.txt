We've enjoyed several standard Chinese dishes here, such as the Wonton Noodle Soup, Shrimp & Vegetable Pan Fried Noodles, and the Fish Fillet with Stir Fried Ginger & Green Onion. They all come out hot, fresh, and tasty, but the real reason to check out Sun Wah is the Peking Duck Dinner. When your bird first comes out the choicest cuts are carved and plated table-side. The duck itself is tender, moist, and flavorful, and the skin is perfectly crisp. You're then given six steamed bao, julienned carrots & scallions, pickled daikon, and hoisin sauce to make some of the tastiest duck sammiches you'll ever consume. After carving, the duck carcass goes back to the kitchen to make Duck Soup and Duck Fried Rice. This duckstravaganza of a meal is a must have for any duck fans. Service is pretty standard as far as Chinese restaurants go, but the spacious loft-like interior is a big upgrade from their days on Argyle.
