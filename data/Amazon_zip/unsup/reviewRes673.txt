I came here with the hubs for my bday in January... yeah, I know my review is late, sorry! Anyway, the food was unbelievable. When you dine here, it's for the experience and to appreciate technique and flavor. You don't come here to chow down - almost all of the plates are one or two bites. My favorites included the kobe beef w/ the deconstructed a-1 sauce and the pork belly confit - so delicious I still dream about it. We had the tour (took about 4.5 hours) and the split wine pairings - however, it's not really split, more like small pours (which was more than enough), which they were kind enough to explain. The service is quite remarkable - we expected it to be a bit snotty, but everyone was really nice and friendly. My advice for anyone going here: do the wine pairings. It is so worth it. You are already spending a lot to eat here, do it right and get the wine!
