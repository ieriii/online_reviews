My favorite Indian restaurant south of Devon, I think the food here is divine! First off, a huge menu with lots of variety guarantees that there is something for everyone. Love me some mango lassi and those teeny tiny samosas. I've been here for dinner and come here a lot for the lunch buffet (great for groups! my office can't seem to leave this place) and the food is always spectacular. I love any saag or aloo dishes and I'm a sucker for spicy lamb and goat curries. The heat is perfect and can be dialed up or down upon request. Service has always been great for me during lunch and exceptional during dinner. The waiters were really helpful in explaining several dishes to my parents and answering any questions we had. Pricey for dinner but great value for lunch, at least come and try the buffet! And you must must must end with mango kulfi and the gulab juman (think super dense deep fried donut holes in rose scented syrup).
