Honestly, I have never been treated this poor in a restaurant. I felt like they were racist against the mixed group of people at our table. I don't think I had a single smile returned or any gracious actions toward my table of 4. We paid a lot of money for subpar food. For $20 bucks you can get a grade D steak to grill. This place is such a joke. I don't know how they have returning customers. Here's the topper though. After being neglected and shunned for the hour or so we were there, they had the nerve to aks us for a larger tip...I normally tip at least 20%. We begrudgingly gave a 15% tip to begin with. which was undeserved and as a group had considered not giving them shit... I gave them a tip. Don't ask for more because your not getting it... Here's the summary. If you want OK food and to be treated like shit. Go to Wiener Circle on Clark. At least there you'll be entertained.
