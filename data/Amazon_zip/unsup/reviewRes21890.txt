The quality of this place has dropped severely within the past two decades. While I have never really been a big fan of the food here or the exorbitant prices (its a freakin' hot dog, not filet mignon) I at least liked the ambiance and the service. Today the woman that served me brought me my food while wearing an expression of complete disdain for my wanting some eats, and once she walked back inside the establishment she sat at the fixin's station and fell asleep on it... right in full view of all the customers in the rear drive-in area. If that is what the service here has become I will not return ever again. Ever.
