This one is LONG overdue. My now-wife and I went here for our New Years' mostly because she has a fondness for New Orleanian food. And because they reported to have great drinks. When we first walked in it was packed. The foyer was separated from the main room by a velvet curtain 16' tall. When we walked in, it was beautiful and my wife says it's pretty typical of high end restaurants in the Quarter. We sat next to the wall nearly at the back by the back room. Which meant it was quieter. And they did have excellent drinks the kind that are en vogue right now: handcrafted and made-to-order. Delicious. And they'll take a little longer, but that's to be expected. As for the food, my wife reports that it's well done but not your typical fare. It's some high class food. Everything we had was great. We did the prix fixe for the evening mostly because we couldn't decide from the many inventive choices on the menu. With drinks (two each) it came to $200, which wasn't unreasonable but certainly not cheap. Definitely a good first date place or a date-night to reconnect with someone special.
