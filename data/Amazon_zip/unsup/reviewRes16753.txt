Ohhh emmm geee. All other Indian restaurants: kneel down and surrender now. You can't touch this place! ...Ponders how to possibly describe the excellence... Alright yelpers, this place is why you have taste buds. The flavors! The spices! The meats! The SERVICE! I went here with a visiting friend who is a bit of a novice when it comes to trying any sort of "ethnic" food. ("What's a tan-DO-ri?") So, I decided to not to go too adventurous on her ass and just do the "Indian Feast for Two." Sounded safe and she gladly accepted my suggestion. We were greeted by naan...soup...salad....then a sizzling plate of "mixed grill" which was shrimp, fish, chicken, goat, etc. plus chicken nawabi tikka, more garlic naan, and finally, when we couldn't possible fit anything more in us--rice pudding for dessert. Holy FEAST! They weren't joking. Not only did this meal more than satisfy both of us--someone unaccustomed to Indian food and myself who loves the stuff--it was just a great dining experience. Our servers were extremely attentive and helpful. The courses came at different times, not just one on top of the other. (That always bothers me.) And I really felt that they captured the essence of Indian cuisine in this novice-friendly "Feast for Two." At $39.95 total, we felt like it was a steal for the evening's cuisine. Hoorah and BRAVO, India House!
