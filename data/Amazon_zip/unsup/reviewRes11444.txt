Wow, I don't think I've ever been here when this place wasn't completely packed. I just recently moved to Chicago, so I had been basically living on deep dish pizza until a friend introduced me to Piece. The pizzas are huge and they have some bizarre toppings, but they don't have pineapple. Weird. Beer is awesome, pizza is amazing. I love it.
