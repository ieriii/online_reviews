So I transferred jobs and working close to home now!! So I have to hit the local lunch spots. I recently ordered lunch from this restaurant and I must say it was great. I called to have them fax me their lunch menu and I received it immediately. I was STARVING that day so I ordered their chile relleno taco dinner and it truly hit the spot. The dinner came with rice and beans for the sides and two huge chiles rellenos with enough tortillas on the side. The chile rellenos were so big that I had to get creative and place my tortillas in a way so that the chile rellenos would fit. Well I must say you get a lot for the price it was delicious. I will order from there again! Oh... the actual restaurant inside is very clean and nice plus the staff is extremely courteous.
