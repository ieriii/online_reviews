They market themselves as "Cheese, Swine and Wine." That's a pretty legit assessment of what these guys do well. The menu is constantly changing so its hard to recommend certain dishes. The Turkey Leg Confit was killer during my first visit, unfortunately, it was already off the menu by my second. Either way, its good to go here as a group of 4-6 people and plan on ordering 3-4 dishes per person. Adventurous eaters are a must! The dishes are basically tapas style. Just keep ordering waves of different items. Experiment! Get our of your comfort zone and try bone marrow, pig ear, blood sausage etc. Is it weird for the sake of being weird? Absolutely not. Its great food that just happens to be weird. Out of the 20 dishes I've tried thus far, I can't think of any "misses." I will warn that they do NOT take reservations so use your brain and plan ahead. Come a bit early, come a bit late. Hell, starve yourself for lunch and try to jet from work early. Its worth it.
