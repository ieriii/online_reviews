Tea review only: I have been here 5+ times for tea. A couple times for birthdays, just by myself to catch up reading and tea, and a couple other time in between. I have never really had a bad experience (do not order a bloody mary though). The sandwiches are the best by far of any of the places to have tea in Chicago....the pastries are also equally as wonder. The hotel is not actually a Ritz-Carlton which is why it comes up a bit short....service has always been kind and attentive. They do not pour your tea for you or wait on you hand and foot but it is enough. I cannot wait until they re-open in May
