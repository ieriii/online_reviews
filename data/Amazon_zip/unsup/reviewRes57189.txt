My date and I went there on Saturday night at 7ish, We didn't have to wait even though the place was busy (plus). Our waitress , Gabby, knew her spiel to a tee (always freaks me out when they recommend dishes before they say Hello, but whatever). We had a plantain and beef appetizer, that we didn't order, but OOPS, Gabby misheard our entire order. We were scared to say the least. Gabby was so polite and actually had the right order out in a matter of moment (props to the kitchen) It was all amazing. We had the ribeye, ceviche de pescado, fried plantains, and the mystery plantain. Everything was delcious and Gabby was a great server. Ican't wait to sucker him into taking me back! The only negative was the oddly sloped floor...
