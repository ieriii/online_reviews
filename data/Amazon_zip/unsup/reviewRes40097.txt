I am so impressed by this place considering it has just opened... This place knows exactly what it is... from the decor to the menu, etc. Everything is focused and feels self-assured.  I had the yuzu toddy (amazing!! I had two of these), pumpkin risotto with pork belly, oxtail/scallops, and tried the roast chicken dish. The risotto/pork belly was a little on the sweet side for me, but good. Everything else was great too. Probably not the most mindblowingly good food I've ever had, but definitely solid, and the price points (entrees average around 25-30 bux) were reasonable. It's the overall package that I appreciate... I've been to restos with a similar feel in Brooklyn and the Lower East Side in NYC that I've been waiting to open in Chicago. Thanks to L & E we finally have one! Finally, I so appreciate that although the food may be a bit upscale, the drink menus are insanely affordable (as mentioned here in the other reviews), so you can still have high quality drinks in a polished but down-to-earth environment at the bar with upscale, affordable bar snacks.
