The Purple Pig was perfectly paired for our party's purposes: after dinner drinks and snacking. The Pork Pt was really impressive, and I thought the Pork Neck Bone Gravy with Calabro Ricotta was also very good, but just not quite as good as the Pt. The Jamon Serrano and selection of cheeses (we opted for an omakase selection) were both very solid. I thought the MIlk Braised Pork Shoulder was just okay, though I admittedly did not have much of it. Hats off to our bearded server, who was incredibly knowledgeable and more than able to help us with selections of wine. The 2007 Domaine Anne Gros Echezeaux, "Les Loachausses", Grand Cru was a great recommendation (admittedly at a pretty healthy markup, but I suppose you have to pay that Michigan Avenue rent somehow). He also expertly guided us through a stronger red wine and then a lighter white wine to end the evening. I cannot help but compare The Purple Pig to Avec. I think the food options at Avec are superior; but as far as the general atmosphere and restaurant environment, I prefer The Purple Pig. Protip: They turn the lights back on full at 2:00am closing time. Ouch! ^ ^;;
