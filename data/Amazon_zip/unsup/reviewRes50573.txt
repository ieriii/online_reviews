Hmmm...let me let a classic sitcom called Fresh Prince of Bel-Air set the tune for this review... *Ahem* This is a story all about how, my dinner got served with some remoulade 'POW'. And I like to take a minute, just sit right there, and I'll tell you how I became a fan of some mighty fine cajun fare. On School and Lincoln is where I had a taste The Dortmunder Gold Lager left me in a daze. Chillin' out, maxin', relaxin' all cool When the waitress came, told me to eat this corn cake or I'd be a fool. When a couple of gals Who didn't know what good food was Started orderin' house salads with no sauce I got in one little fight and my date got scared She said 'Not everyone loves ratatouille, why should you care?' I whistled for the waitress and when she came near Her nametag said 'Flo' and she offered me another beer If anything I can say hoppin' john and cheese grits as sides are rare But I thought 'Now forget it' - 'I'll try 'em both, you don't have to dare' I finished my meal, with blackened seasonin' still on my face And I yelled to the other patrons 'YO, I LOVE THIS PLACE' I looked at my gut, I was full beyond compare I know that I will return, for some mighty fine cajun fare
