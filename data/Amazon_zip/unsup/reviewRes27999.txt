I must say that, to begin, this was one of the best meals I've had in years! This restaurant lives up to all of the hype. The only reason why I gave it 4 is the inconsistencies with their reservation policy on line. Their website says: FRONTERA GRILL WEBSITE Reservation policy: Though our dining room is mostly seated on a first come first serve basis, we take a limited amount of reservations for all size parties. Please call to check availability. METROMIX WEBSITE Accepted. Both accept for lunch. At dinner, Frontera accepts reservations for parties of 5 to 10 in advance and a limited number of day of reservations for all size parties; Topolobampo takes them for parties up to 6. I was going with my wife only, and when I called, "day of" for a reservation, per the metromix website, they said that they take reservations for all size parties up to 3 months in advance, so of course, there was nothing available. If I would have known that, OF COURSE I would have made a reservation 3 months ago! So, after a 2+ hour wait, I can honestly say that the food was STILL worth it, and this restaurant comes highly recommended, despite their lack of organization with respect to their reservation policy.
