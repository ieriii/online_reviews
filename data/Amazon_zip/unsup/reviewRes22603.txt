My mom went to school with the original owner's son, I think they called him Mush or something weird like that, and I finally went to it (I probably went when I was little but I don't remember). So it's a drive in and it totally brings you back to the 50s. There aren't servers on roller skates but you order from your car, or you can order inside, and they will bring the food out to you on one of those trays that you attach to your car. I really liked the atmosphere and the staff seemed very nice. I've only eaten the Superdawg and that was very tasty...it's pretty much a Chicago style dog with fries but they've got other yummy foods and Ice cream. It's pretty much a Chicago landmark and everyone should go at least once for the experience.
