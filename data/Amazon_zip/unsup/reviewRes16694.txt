OHHh...my mouth waters for the Lamb #203, AlooGobi, and Biryani chicken. The Samosas were also very tasty and I piled the tamarind and chutney sauce.....mmmm. I even enjoyed the juicy and tender tandoori chicken. At some Indian places I felt like this was a eye-catching type of dish not so much a feast for the taste buds. But three orders were made. The naan was also warm and yummy. I ate with my hands, that's how I sometimes roll.  Lamb #203 on the spicier side of what I'm used to, but the meat was tender and yummy. I was pleased to find that the food was to my liking. I do like Indian food, but I didn't feel in the mood for it this particularly -14 degree temperature night. I was in the mood for noodles, but this place actually hit my spot. I went home with a belly full and the clothes a little on the more pungent side. Since eating at this downtown spot, and finding out there are a number of suburban locations makes me want to eat more of this wonderful food. I will have to try out the lunch buffet.
