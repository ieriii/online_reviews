Quality food at decent prices. I had the cubano sandwich and beef empanada, both were really good. The cubano was done almost perfectly - ham, pork, swiss cheese, pickles and mustard on white bread, pressed, warm, and solid. It was a bit dry, could use a couple more pickle slices. The sandwich came with some plantain chips and was very filling. The empanada had great flavor, meaty filling and flaky pastry, and it came with a side of green sauce.  I can't wait to try the other sandwiches
