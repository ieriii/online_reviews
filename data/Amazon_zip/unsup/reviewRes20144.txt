I was all primed to say that this was a run of the mill Loop bar, with the noted exception that they serve Half-Acre beer, when in my drunkness, I realized that they served poutine. At that point, the Gage automatically got an extra star. My food and drink were excellent, and, somehow, my pint glass never seemed empty ... but that could have been that I had five of them in about 2 hours. But besides that, the staff was really nice, and on their game. The downside is that it's a little expensive.
