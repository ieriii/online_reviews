One of the best known veg restaurants known to man yet I can't give it five stars. They have been "Meat Free since 83'" yet don't serve FRENCH FRIES!!! How can a 'diner' of all places not have fricking french fries? A diner is defined by its fried food selections. All of their food is seitan and is the bad for you kind of veg stuff so why not french fries? I know they have sweet potato fries, but they just don't cut the mustard in my book. All of their dishes though are scrumptious and they usually have even raw options so if you are veg or vegan this is your mecca. Also, having beers available is great, especially when they serve mojitos in the summer on their back patio; what bliss! Most dishes are takes from traditional American diner plates: Dagwoods, Philly Cheese Steak, Chicken Parmesan Sandwiches, Wing Dings, Rubens, etc... They also have the variety of mexican, fajitas, flautas, and also used to have a sushi plates but I think it is no more? I love this place dearly, but can't make a diner five stars when they lack the iconic french fries. Chicago Diner, get french fries and I'll give you five stars.
