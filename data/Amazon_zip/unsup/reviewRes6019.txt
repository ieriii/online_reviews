While I haven't been to Italy, I've been told that the food there is very simple, but mind blowing. That pretty much sums up the food at Davanti Enoteca. We started out with a $14 dollar bottle of wine, which the waitress recommended over the more expensive choice (thanks for your honesty!) Then we ordered a mason jar of ricotta and honey, which was served with giant pieces of toast. I could have made a meal out of this alone, but we had other dishes coming....  We had a very refreshing hearts of palm salad and an outstanding beet salad. Both were good, but the beet salad is a must-order again in the future. We also ordered the cacio e pepe, a simple pasta dish that only contains about 5 ingredients (salt, pepper, cheese, pasta) but is seriously life changing.  And for dessert, we had a light as air hazelnut chocolate torte. It was so delicious, I can't stop thinking about it. You'll have to wait to go here-- we arrived at 6 and weren't seated until 7:15. But, you probably won't mind waiting because there's a wine bar across the street and also the food is totally worth it.
