Simply divine. We had dinner here for a special occasion, and one of our group had extensive dietary restrictions. The staff at Tru was gracious and accommodating to all of our needs. We each had the 5-course Grand tasting, and each course was truly exquisite. The presentation of each course balanced art and whimsy. The halibut in curry broth served in a coconut shell was so tasty that I'm now experimenting with my own version! I've been to Trotter's, Nobu, Daniel, Le Bernardin, Jean Georges, just to name a few on the upper end, but Tru was one of the best experiences yet. We will definitely be back for our next special occasion!
