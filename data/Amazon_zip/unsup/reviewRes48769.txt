On our recent visit to Chicago, we were looking for something fresh and fun, just off the beaten path. This restaurant seemed to fit the bill, so we made a reservation for 2 through Open Table, which was convenient. The location is easy to reach by bus and on foot, just west of the loop across the river. The restaurant itself was very nice and trendy. The communal restrooms and quirky lighting were unique and added to the experience. But I must say that we were not overly impressed with the service or our meal. We settled on 4 dishes and only 2 of them were winners. The steak tartare was delicous, although I was surprised it wasn't served with bread or crackers on which to spread the meat. Just eating it off the fork was a little odd to me. The parsnips were also quite tastey - nice flavors of the roasted parsnips, sweet dates, and crunchy cashews went well together. The ribs were our biggest disappointment. At $26ish dollars for this dish, we expected a more substantial serving. We were served TWO ribs, of which had maybe 6 bites of meat once you cut around the bone and trimmed off the excessive amount of fat. I wasn't going to say anything at first, but then my boyfriend looked at me with disappointment, and we agreed that was a bad order. We were also disppointed our server did not ask if we wanted another round of beer before clearing our empty glasses after only just beginning the second dish. We were also not offerred dessert. After spending about $80 on dinner for two, we left in search of a nice frozen yogurt establishment.
