Pequod's pizza is right up there as one of my favorite pizzas. The sauce is sweet, but not overly sweet and there's the right amount of cheese. Not too much... not too little. For some strange reason I am not a fan of pizza w/ a crapload of cheese. I like my pizza slightly well done and the price isn't too bad. Dammit.. now I want pizza. Only 4 stars due to lack of parking... street parking sucks.
