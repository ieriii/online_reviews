All I can say about the restaurant, overall experience, wait staff, and actually food is "SO GOOD". I took my boyfriend here for his birthday as a surprise. I don't live in Chicago so I was a little nervous about trying it for the first time for this special occasion but after reading the ratings I went ahead and made reservations. The portions are huge and the food ABSOLUTELY delicious. I will be back again, and again, and again!
