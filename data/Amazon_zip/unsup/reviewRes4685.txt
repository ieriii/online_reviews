Someone on the street told me about this place when I asked where to eat - totally a great suggestion. I had the Salted Beets with Goat Cheese & Pistacio - WONDERFUL. Now for the charcuterie - I come from a place in the country where it is hard to come by so I decided to make a complete pig out of myself - I ate the $30 sampler platter by myself and regardless of the fact that I have probably consumed a years worth of sodium it was totally worth it and ridiculously satisfying. Awesome atmosphere, friendly staff, great wine and very hard to come by Spanish beers which I love.
