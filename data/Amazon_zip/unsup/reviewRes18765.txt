Do you like beer? Do you like fun people? Do you like friendly bar staff? Do you like BOARD GAMES, PAC MAN, SHUFFLEPUCK, FOOSEBALL, AND GOLDEN TEE? Then, you're going to like Bad Apple. Like most places a little off the beaten path, Bad Apple promises a chill atmosphere and good times. Ronnie behind the bar is a ridiculously knowledgeable bro when it comes to stellar recommendations, with the patience of a saint. Also.. props to him for not broadsiding me with a bottle when I jokingly asked for a Miller Lite.
