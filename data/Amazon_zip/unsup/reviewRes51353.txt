A Godsend! The best Mexican food I've had in a long, long time. I stumbled into Garcia's Restaurant after walking a half a mile in desperate need of some food and some booze. The group I was with saw the lit-up full service bar and dashed in just to grab a few drinks. I decided to order a coconut margarita, which was mediocre and standard, and Enchilada Suiza with rice and beans. My dish was so delectable. The portion sizes were huge! Perfectly cooked and the cheese was melted perfectly, the ranchero sauce was amazing too. The rice was fluffy and the beans were ground up by hand. The salsa was the best too! Great texture! Not too smooth but still had integrity of a chunky salsa. The flavors were excellent and wasn't too overpowering with the cilantro. The chips are always hot and home made! The best part was the entire meal was $8.50. Go here. Eat. Drink. Repeat.
