People will complain about the wait in line or the price but the bottom line is this place makes great breakfast food. If you tend to get impatient waiting in lines, just bring a glamor magazine to read in line or for you intellectuals, bring an economist or a calculus textbook. If you think the place is expensive while in line looking at the menu, then head a few blocks down to a McDonald's and order off the dollar menu something or that new Southern Chicken Sandwich for breakfast which isn't bad. By you leaving the line, I just get to my breakfast quicker. I ate at the Bongo Room for two breakfasts while I was in Chicago and split a bunch of stuff. My favorite sweet dish was the White Chocolate and Carmel Pretzel Pancakes. If you're a chocolate person, my friend Dabner K.'s favorite dish was the chocolate French toast. This place also makes a very good omelet with a generous portion of ingredients, and the potatoes that come with the omelet are also delicious.  If you're a sweet person, you'll enjoy the entire meal consisting of chocolate French toast, Oreo pancakes, or White Chocolate and Carmel Pretzel Pancakes but I would recommend ordering an omelet and splitting a half order of one of the sweet dishes with another person almost serving as a breakfast dessert.
