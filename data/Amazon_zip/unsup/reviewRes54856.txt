This is one of those great neighborhood bars in Andersonville. The beer is great, the music too (not too loud). The first time we went I had the mussels and my friend had the mac & cheese and both were surprisingly fantastic, and not just for bar food! I completely agree that the salads are underrated and really something that you have to try. Overall a great little neighborhood bar that is small but cozy at the same time.
