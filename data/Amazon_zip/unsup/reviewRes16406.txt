I've heard about this infamous bar years ago, and luckily I've just had the pleasure of being in the neighborhood and stopping in after a lengthy dinner at Forno's (review coming later) in the trendy Wicker Park area. I have to admit that I was a little taken aback by the non-descript entrance, as it's just as unnoticeable as most of the grafitti, bill-posted buildings in this area. After giving the door gentlemen my Id, I had no idea that a luxurious underworld of a 60's inspired swag lounge awaited; laden with crystal chandeliers, high-back chairs, intimate votive candles and private gathering areas for all to indulge in. This was extremely decadent. The waitress was good, although a little unfamiliar with a few of the cocktails on their menu, but it was a tad loud and I have a tendency to be soft-spoken, in her defense. She suggested a couple drinks and my boyfriend and I were far from disappointed. The bartenders seem extremely knowledgeable, warm-spirited, and really have captured the essence of making you feel in a time warped vintage cocktail lounge parlor. Although I didn't eat, they had a few "creative" appetizers on the menu that I would be curious to sample. All in all a great time with fancy cocktails (not cheap) and an atmosphere that is unlike another that I have experienced in this city. Will definitely be back! Love!
