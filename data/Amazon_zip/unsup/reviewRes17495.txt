I have been here a few times in different situations and Carnivale is always fantastic. The dining room is beautifully designed and the bar area is also a really cool place to sit. Food wise-I usually stick with the guacamole for an appetizer and the Churrasco for dinner. They are both, respectively, two of the best dishes of their kind in the city. I always leave feeling buzzed, and perfectly full (not the kind of full where you feel the need to be wheeled out). I highly recommend Carnivale whether you are on a date, in a group, business meeting, whatever. The only thing I would warn against is going at the peak times. I have had success with tables going a little on the early side or late side. Follow this and I think you will avoid some of the headaches that others sometimes speak of service and hostess wise.
