New Haven style pizza in Chicago I have to see this. Yep, nailed it. I went here with my Girlfriend's father for lunch. He grew up in the Havens of CT and he was blown away by this Pizza. So thank you Mr. P. for finding the best New Haven style pizza in the midwest. This place is nice and clean, their staff is especially friendly and makes you feel like you're part of the old neighborhood. I was there once and it was extremely busy the whole time. I don't know how we got a seat. Mr. P. talked to the owner and thanked him for bringing CT to IL. The owner is a great guy too. We ended up taking an entire pizza to go, along with some t-shirts to remember that place.
