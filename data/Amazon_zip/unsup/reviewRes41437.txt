Meat in a box smoked in chocolate. Incredible. This place takes all the pretentiousness out of fine dining and brings it down to reality. The service was excellent and friendly. BYOB makes the bill arrive at a number that doesn't make you vomit in your own mouth and try to swallow it without your date noticing. I went here with my baby and brought a nice bottle of Schramsberg Blanc de Noir. We had one of the best meals ever. Keep your mind open and enjoy each and every dish they bring you. You won't be disappointed. Allow an hour and a half at least for dinner so you might want two bottles of wine...I only brought one and I tried to get the waitress to run up to California and Armitage to pick me up a 40 of Olde English, but she had too many tables so I had to switch to water.
