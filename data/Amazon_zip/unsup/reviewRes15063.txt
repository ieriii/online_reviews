Good Place, looks like it was built in about 1950 and not updated.. Super Old School!! Actual Hostess that knows what she's doing.. Packed on the weekends! Grabbed a few drinks at Bar, service fast, lil pricey.. Table, they bring Za Bread right away and it's awesome! Then a full menu of Classic Italian items.. Great Food! Had Chx Parm. And it was awesome, highly recc'd
