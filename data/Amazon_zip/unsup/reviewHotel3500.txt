The swank lobby is a bit of an oversell on a awkward cramped room with some weird design issues. The hallway reeked of cigarette smoke and I had a lot of trouble with getting calls out on the 3GS network. Also, I didn't appreciate the concierge who could barely be bothered to make eye contact with me except to explain to me as though I was a child that the hotel holds card information in their system for incidentals.
