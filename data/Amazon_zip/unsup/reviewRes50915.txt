Talk about unique and fun. This place was slap your mama good! It really was. The breakfast was original and fun. It is totally different than any other place in Chicago. Having grown up in the coastal region of Florida, this was upscale panhandle eating. Who would have thought in Chicago. This place is definitely worth the experience. I also loved that their staff was just so professional and well groomed.
