LOVE this place. I moved back from NYC last year and this place reminds me of some of my favorites there- Pastis, LaConda Verde, Circle Rouge......Huge bar-which is always good if you are by yourself, white tile floors, black tin ceilings, high ceilings. Love the high top/banquets in the front area. Food- fantastic. Highly recommend the risotto, chicken and fish and chips. Owners are lovely!
