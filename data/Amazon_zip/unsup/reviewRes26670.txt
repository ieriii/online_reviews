Wow SUPER crowded for sunday lunch-- must be a peak hour! CASH only! Very authentic! Get a pitcher of horchata :) so delicious and refreshing! Carne asada burrito was pretty authentic and tasty-- sorta on the greasy side and the lackluster rice was whatevers. But pretty good price for $6... my friends also liked the mole. Def want to go back to try other things like tamales on the menu. I always have tons of mexican food cravings since I miss my LA spots. I def think I will be back.
