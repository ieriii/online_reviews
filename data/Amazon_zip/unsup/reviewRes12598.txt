I tried out Cafe 28 at the insistence of rave reviews of friends and the discounted price of Groupon. I took my girlfriend here, and yes we have been dating long enough for me to use a groupon on a date. The restaurant was packed and I was glad I made a reservation. We got an inattentive waitress who seemed to only be serving us and the table next to us. She either had tables in the other area of the restaurant for some senseless reason or was overwhelmed by the prospect of two tables. It took an hour and fifteen minutes from when we sat down until our main courses came out. In addition to this, I ordered a Pacifico, and never was able to get the waitress's attention for another round of beer. Before I review the food, I will say I have been on a quest for Ropa Viejo in chicago. I love that dish and have found many places in other cities that do a great job of it. If the Ropa Viejo was delicious, it would make up for the sub-par service. But... We ordered the Papas Rellenas, which sounded awesome only to have bland flavorless dish show up. After this appetizer, We ordered the ropa vieja and the pistachio crusted the chicken. The ropa vieja was bland and just OK, as were the fried plantains. The Pistachio chicken was actually very good. It was moist, tender and delicious. Do to the poor service, we opted to skip desert. The pistachio chicken was very good, but not good enough to justify the trip and the atrocious service. If for some reason I end up back here and the service improves, I would give it another star.
