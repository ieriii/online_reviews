Absolutely adore this place. If I could give 4 1/2 stars, I would, but I'm rounding up for the surprise factor. Wow this place delivers, despite its location.  Totally recommend the salt roasted beets. My dinner companion dislikes two out of the three ingredients (beets and pistachios) and it was still a hit. That's how good it is. The cheese course comes with this little quince bite that's just divine. And the chicken thighs? So tender and such great flavor. Not to mention the value! They give you two huge pieces to fight over. On the other hand, I really don't get the big following for the milk braised pork shoulder. I've had better, and with meat you go with either the medium rare or totally fall off the bone quality, and this one was just neither. Also, what is up with the bread that comes with the smears? It's almost like they were swimming in oil. I wonder if they would bring me plain bread if I asked? It would make those smears so much more appetizing. Despite all of this, the good truly outweighs the mediocre, and I am so looking forward to the next visit.
