Came here with a local friend of mine, very cool place, and was told by her that it is one of the few tolerable night spots in the area. Had an awesome Sazerac, and the tomato/mozzerella on toast item from the menu was really delicious. Not too crowded on a Friday night, even during Lollapalooza, lively atmosphere, good music going but not too loud. Really good place.
