I've been eating here ever since I was a kid! (way before Garcia's did their renovation, which let me tell you, was complete torture b/c they were closed the entire time!!) I miss their old place b/c even though it was small, it was still very inviting. Now, when I walk in, I feel like I'm walking inside a huge warehouse, the Sam's Club of Garcia's! Regardless, their food is scrumptious! I always order the same thing as I'm worried that if I order anything else, I won't be as satisfied. Their carne asada is to die for!! Their skirt steak is made to perfection and I love eating it w/ rice and beans!! Whenever I go with someone, they always order one of their burritos and I must warn you, they are gigantic! Most people are full from just eating half of it and I'm pretty sure they're still good when you heat them up late at night!
