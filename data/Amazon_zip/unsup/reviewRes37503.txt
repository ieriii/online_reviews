I think you have to be a hipster PRICK to like this place other than the beer selection. I live a block away from the place and been like three times. There is one bartender (black hair, white lady) she sucks!!!! I tried to get my girlfriend a glass of wine and what I got for 7 bucks or something like that was the bottom of the bottle in a hugh wine glass. when I asked is that all she replys "the bottle is done" Well open another one an pour a NORMAL serving you retard. it's like they hate to serve anyone they don't already know. (I'm trying not to play the race card) I do like the beer selection and the old wood in the place, but other than that I'll be going over to THE MAPROOM for my beer fetish from now on.
