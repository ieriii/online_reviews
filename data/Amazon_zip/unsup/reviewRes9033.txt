Ive gotten pick-up from these folks several times and dined in for the first time last week. I went here on a Sunday, while an ex and I were trying to catch up. She suggested Semirami's, which is closed on Sundays; I suggested Noon O Kebab and showed her the way. I promise, that's as close as I'll come to a double entendree. She got an eggplant dish. She loves eggplant and raved about it. I got the chicken and koubideh combo. My biggest complaint is that they could have used more rice. However, I took some leftovers home and was able to whip up some more rice pretty easily. I will continue to get take out, and will take somebody next time I'm near Albany Park and we want tasty Persian food.
