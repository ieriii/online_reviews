this place is beautiful and bacon is in almost everything... i would give it 5 stars..but a few little things were off, foodwise. Service is awesome. the kind of negatives but not major: the pretzel was lacking...pretzel-ness if that makes sense.. the dough, to me, tasted more on the bread side than a pretzel? i had the goat cheese and beet salad, which i always love.. there was bacon in that too... and a little too much, it almost over powered the salad. i had the seared tuna with white beans. the tuna was a HUGE portion..but not too much else i can say about that, the white beans were really tasty (again with bacon) my friend had the pork belly and i had some, and that also was a large portion and really amazing.. next time i will go with that.
