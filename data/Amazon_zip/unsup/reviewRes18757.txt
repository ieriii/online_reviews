I had the torta ahogada, which is a torta drowned in a chile sauce. It's a very common street food in Guadalajara, where my parents are from. I wasn't thrilled with the Bayless version. It's all in the sauce and his sauce leaned a little on the fatty side. I washed it down with a hibiscus green tea or some such concoction that was divine. I'd go back just for the tea. Plus, I have a feeling maybe some of the other offerings will be better so I'm willing to go back but this review is based strictly on the torta ahogada, which was not that tasty. Skip it.
