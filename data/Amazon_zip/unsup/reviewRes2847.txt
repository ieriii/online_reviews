If you are wondering where to dine in Chicago, TRU is a must. Absolutely a memorable experience. Intimate restaurant, elegant and thoughtful in every single detail. You have to appreciate the unconventional taste in their design- with fresh almond branches as floral arrangements and artichoke table top pieces... Unparalleled dining, service and ambiance. Simplistic room with sophistication. Discriminate taste in art pieces displayed; consistent theme in their presentation as each dish served. Fixed menu. Menu changes up every time so I won't waste my time on the details of what we ordered. Small portions/ 9 course meals- but you'll be stuffed!! For a party of three- The Chef's Market Collection = $500
