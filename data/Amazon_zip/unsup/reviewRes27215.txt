The tasting menu is amazing! After bringing out the truffle popcorn (which by the way I can eat ALL DAY), they brought out complimentary glasses of bubbly for my birthday. I loved it already. The first course, the deconstructed caesar salad was delicious. No joke, the romaine, brioche, & a tiny anchovy all together could not have been bigger than a twinkie. However, it was so good. Who knew that it could be so satisfying?  The butternut squash soup with the curry marshmallow was TASTY. The person responsible for thinking to make a curry marshmallow is both weird and a genius.  Third course was scallops with some kind of sauce. To be honest, I wasn't such a big fan of the sweet fruity sauce in combination of the scallops, but it's because I like my scallops simple & savory. Wagyu beef shortrib with root vegetables and a heavenly consomme. Best dish of the night. Words can't describe it. Really. Chocolate s'mores with peanut gelato...soo good. They also brought out some spiced krispie treats for us at the end. I loved the atmosphere of the restaurant. Laid-back and unpretentious with loft-style windows and decorations. The food left me surprisingly full, even though most tasting menus leave me hungry for more grub.  Overall, this was a great dining experience!
