I've been to all three big Brazilian Steakhouses(also Fogo and Texas de Brazil) and all of them have their pluses and minuses but this one edges to the top for the following reasons. I'm not much of a salad person, but I did notice their salad bar had the least variety. However, their hot section of the salad bar was great especially the mushroom risotto. I've been here three times and the service was just iffy once and I would almost venture to say that the gauchos were the most attentive. And although you need to make a reservation, we've had to wait each time but honestly what big restaurants don't have a minimal wait. The martinis are the best out of the three also. I've had the Mojito and Pomegranate Martini. The other thing that sets it apart is that it has all of the meats but also offers the grilled shrimp and pineapple giving you a different taste for the palate along with the meats. Out of the three the environment is probably the least creative.  It is pricey however and one of the other reasons it only gets four stars.
