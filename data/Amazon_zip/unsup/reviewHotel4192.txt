A monster of a hotel; not the place to go for an intimate experience. It's kind of like staying in a hotel room located at the mall just between The Sharper Image and Spencer's Gifts. Nice enough rooms, with all the standard Hyatt amenities; but really nothing worth writing home about. Minus an additional point for the weird dance club island in the lobby on weekend nights.
