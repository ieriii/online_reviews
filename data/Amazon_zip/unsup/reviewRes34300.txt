What an absurd wait! We trusted the food would be superb but it was just alright. The benedict was to be expected, the french toast to standard. The multi gran pancake received honorable mention- I am a pancake snob and it was more than your McD's style fluffy paste and caramel coloring syrup. It doesn't hold a candle to M Henry or Orange (only at Printer's Row) on a good day.
