Tru is definitely my number one when it comes to expensive cuisine. I have been to Avenues and Charlie Trotter's and Tru just stands out to me. Don't get me wrong, the food at Avenues and Charlies Trotter's are divine, however the entire experience and Tru definitely blew me away. My Husband and I got a gift card for our wedding and we were so excited cause we'd wanted to try it. Upon arrival you are treated like royalty. EVERYONE, not just your server is helpful and very polite. The place itself is beautifully decorated, very posh and upscale. We ordered a nice bottle of wine and the bread tray comes and you can pick what you want. We chose the Grand Tasting Menu and it was a ton of food. Everything tasted amazing, it was "orgasmic". And being a cheese lover, i was a sucker for the infamous cheese cart. Yes, I couldn't help myself. Then comes the dessert cart, they have so many small bites and varieties. And, they come back if want so if you didn't get everything you wanted, no worries. To top off the evening, they give you a very nice personalized printout with your name, your menu and the date. I know, it's so simple but adds a very nice touch. Now all this does come with a pricey tag. We have a $250 GC and it covered half. It was definitely worth it and a memorable experience. Not a typical dinner/date place but for a very special occasion, I'd go with Tru above the rest.
