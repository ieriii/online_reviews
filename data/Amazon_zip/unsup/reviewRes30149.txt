Super friendly staff. Nicely decorated place (except for the hanging plastic straws over the sushi bar). Food was good. Portions are very satisfactory. The points off for me would be the acoustics. THIS PLACE IS PLAIN LOUD. I could hardly speak with my lunch companion and the effort and the me repeating things over and the leaning over was too much like P90X, if you know what I mean. I need a discount for all that extra physical work to talk to my friend. It was lunch. I can't imagine dinner.  Hey, I'm a beautiful, young, striking person myself, but unlike the other young beautiful, windswept, effortless fashion plates there, I was not satisfied with my choice of meetup place this day. Too freakin' loud and the stomach crunches I had to do just hear my fellow man was an extra thing. The other extra thing was the urban olympics trek (Parkour) to the latrines. An unintended workout for a quick downtown lunch. Dec, your architect failed you on this one.
