It seems that the restaurant has come a long way in year. While I don't find the food quality to be 5-star, the service definitely isn't as bad as some reviewers have described a year ago. I'm actually even surprised it was as bad as some people say, because our waiter was a driving force behind my 3 stars. Being a Top Chef Masters fan, this was an obvious pick during my trip to Chicago. I went in with reasonably high expectations and GE hit close to the mark, but not quite. The cheddar risotto sounded SO GOOD, but was so average! The cheese-its were out of place and the bacon "pancetta" was all fat and no meat (for flavor, not eating I guess). As mentioned, the caesar salad was strange but tasty (the anchovies were good but the monster crouton wasn't worth the calories). For entrees, we all ordered seafood: Arctic char: Good, the brussel sprouts were great. Scallops: I still don't like scallops and even GE couldn't convince me that they're good. I didn't get to try the cod because my BF scarfed it down before I got the chance. So no review there. Which also leads me to my next point that the PORTIONS ARE TINY. Fill up on the delish popcorn, how can you go wrong with truffle oil and Parmesan? The bill was enormous considering we didn't order drinks, and definitely over priced for what we were served. I wouldn't go back.
