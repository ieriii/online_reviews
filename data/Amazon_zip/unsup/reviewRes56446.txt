AMAZING! I can't say enough good things about this place! I went to this bright, darling restaurant with co-workers one day after one of them couldn't stop displaying everything she got for eight dollars. The girl couldn't have been happier, and now I know why.The lunch special includes refreshing ginger iced (or hot) tea or lemonade, soup, salad, an egg roll, an entree, rice and fruit. Yes - as my friend kept repeating - all for eight dollars! The entire meal was absolutely delectable. I had the calamari and its garlic sauce was the perfect subtle seasoning the dish needed.On top of the delicious food, the service was wonderful. Our waitress was sweet and attentive and the man I took for the owner couldn't have been nicer! I will certainly be back again, especially considering it's BYOB. (I've actually already ordered take out from there twice since then). If you're looking for somewhere filling, fresh and affordable, Simply It is the place.
