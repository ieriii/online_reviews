Alot of place feel the need to have mostly items with a twist on their menu (orange, toast) Yolk has some of those but also does the tradtionals up nice. Also theres SO MUCH FOOD. I got the farmhouse it's biscuits an gravy, I get my eggs scrambled on the side and hash browns. It's so hard to finish and so satisfying. Just go on a weekday if you can, weekends get way too nutty for me.
