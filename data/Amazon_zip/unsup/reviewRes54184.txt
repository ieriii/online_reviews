Went to Xoco and had the Jamon sandwich-great, but the salty aftertaste stuck with me. Brought my wife back for one of the soups-I took one sip of mine (chicken posole), and definitely didn't like it. There was some ingredient or combo of ingredients in it that left me dreading having to finish it since I had already paid for it. My wife, who is from Mexico, had the rib soup-not good either. We ordered chips with guacamole for the kids, and when the salty chips ran out, we asked for more-one of the waiters responded that we would have to go back to the cash register and pay for more! Not even the cheapest Mexican restaurants elsewhere will ask you to do this-c'mon, Rick, your patrons are shelling out big bucks, and shouldn't be hearing this! I believe Mr. Bayless knows what he is doing, and definitely needs to rework these soups! I will go back to try out other offerings.
