This restaurant blew my mind! I knew that Graham Elliot was an out of the box chef, but his food was out of this world! Everything we tried was very good and surprising. The sweet breads I ordered were very light and beautifully handled, so there wasn't a harsh flavor. There is one thing you have to order when there: the caesar salad. I know, I know, it sounds like something you can get anywhere, but the way he makes it is unlike any other place. This one dish alone had me hooked. Its deconstructed so eat bite is different depending on how you construct it. There is a brioche/cheese twinkie that is the best take on a crouton I have ever had. No other caesar salad can hold a candle to this one. Also, the service was GREAT and the music/atmosphere is wonderful. Its fine dining, but the music gives it a very comfortable feel.
