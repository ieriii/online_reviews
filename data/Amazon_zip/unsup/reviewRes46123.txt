I always had a good time at the Grand Lux Cafe. The space they have is deceptively large - the food is good and the desserts are pretty memorable. Great place for birthdays or pre-theater or post-symphony or mid-boring-opera or... well, you get the point. It's not really a Chicago insider-type place, given that it's smack-bang in the middle of Michigan Avenue and overloaded with the tourist crowd, but not bad nevertheless.
