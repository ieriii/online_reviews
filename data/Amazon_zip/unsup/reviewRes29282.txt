I don't think the Chicago Diner has chefs. They have magicians. Magicians capable in making the best Vegan food known to man.  The gluten free vegan grilled cheese dipped in ranch dressing - treat yourself. I never thought I'd taste anything this creamy, decedant, delicious again.  I live in the 'burbs, so it's a trek to get there, but anyone on the edge of making the plunge to vegetarianism or veganism, I take here. I want to show them how great it can be. Treat. Your. Self.
