I slacked a bit for Vday and didn't make reservations anywhere, but decided it would be a good time to try the hidden gem down the street, Caro Mio. Of course it was crowded and there was a wait, but it seemed like they were able to get us in quickly. Again, despite the craziness of the evening, our waiter was pleasant and attentive. My boyfriend and I both ordered the specials which were AMAZING. Mine was a pesto gnocchi .....something fantastic. Every bite of each course was to die for.
