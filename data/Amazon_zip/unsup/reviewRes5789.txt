Went here to continue celebrating my birthday! Everything was great! There were 8 in our party, service was great and everyone enjoyed themselves. We made reservations and our table was ready when we arrived. You must order the chopped salad! Everyone enjoyed their meals: coconut shrimp, ny strip, surf & turf, shrimp & crab bisque and the filet. Service was great. Wildfire is great for date night for two and for large parties. yummy :)
