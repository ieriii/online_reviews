The good: - CHEAP prices all around, at least considering the quantities that you get for the price. - Ample selection at the salad bar ($5.99/pound). - Falafel is a good one here and worth trying. - Chicken shwarma is the best of the meat options. - Hummus is quite good, with a perfect consistency and balanced flavor. - The yellow rice is tasty. - BYOB The not-so-good: - Pitas many times are quite stale. Just a slight toasting or steaming would help out immensely. - Kefta isn't very flavorful. Sadly, this American white boy's kefta is much better. - Salad greens at the salad bar are often wilted, and none of the dressings are labeled, making it a bit of a guessing game. - Homeboy at the register is downright rude many times. While I've found the counter service to be pretty good when ordering food, paying that guy can be annoying. While Sultan's does some things pretty well, and other things not-so-well, I think you can still go there for a cheap meal that is tasty, if you know what to get (stick with the falafel, hummus and chicken shwarma). It still leaves me desiring my last neighborhood's Middle Eastern spot- Cedar's down in Hyde Park.
