I ate their last night and it was delicious. The food was worth the price. My mom and I ordered the lamb and joujeh, but then we changed our minds and ordered the lamb shank and loobia polo, but they gave us the wrong order so we got the lamb shank and loobia polo with a skewer of beef. I also had a mango martini. Still, the food was delicious. Worth the $27. The place is clean and the waitresses and waiter are nice.
