Solid! The good stuff is AMAZING, but that's slightly offset by some so-so other items. The yuca comes pureed in falafel-size balls and is easily the best I've ever had. The carne a la parilla--skirt steak dish with rice, onions, pepper sauce, etc.--comes with tortillas to make tacos and is delicious. Skip the honey jalapeo pork chops that look great on paper, but are just ok. Tres leches for dessert is decent, but the profiteroles aren't. Will go back for sure.
