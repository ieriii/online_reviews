I was visiting Chicago from out of town, and my girlfriend and I decided to try this landmark out. What started out as a new vegetarian restaurant to try out became one of my new favorite restaurants. First impressions: speedy service, fresh coffee, and a giant menu in a hip, but unpretentious joint. Final impressions: a filled belly with a mostly filled wallet. The seitan sausage was definitely the star of the show. Try the biscuits & gravy- even if you're from the south, you will not be disappointed.   Whether you're an omnivore, carnivore, or herbivore, this place is not to be missed.
