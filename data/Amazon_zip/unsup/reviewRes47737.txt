This place is the upscale version of Fogo de Chao and Texas De Brazil. As in, people are dressed up and the quality of food matches the upscale atmosphere of the place! The space is beautifully lit with hundreds of candles with a modern theme - great for groups or a romantic date. The salad bar is the most amazing salad bar ever! They have a spectacular arrangement of cheeses, spreads, fruits, mushrooms, appetizers, etc. I had 3 helpings at the salad bar even though i typically try to save my appetite for the meats. While the meat selections are very good, I still think Fogo De Chao offers the best quality meats and flavors. I loved the lamb chops here though! Service is 5 star quality as well. While I've sometimes felt like I was being herded in like a cow at Fogo de Chao, the serve at Zed451 is personal, professional and attentive. Wine is pricey but good. Definitely try the rooftop for dates if they are not too crowded. It's really beautiful.
