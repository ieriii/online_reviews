I love it here and all the hype has been deserved. It's just a really lovely restaurant. The staff are awesome and super friendly. There are tons of wines to pick from. The olives are great. I could eat the beet plate every day of my life and be happy. The sausage pizza is very filling with perfect crust. Good risotto. I have the burger and the polenta on my list of things to try next. There are just too many good things to pick from here. Fantastic experience. Oh, and the bathroom was a fun surprise. Very nice! Can't go wrong with Clint Eastwood on the wall!
