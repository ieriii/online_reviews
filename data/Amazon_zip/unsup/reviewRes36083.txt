I gave Meli 5 Moons because of a few reasons. The menu is really inventive, crazy good. The decor is really nice and updated and the food and service were both excellent. Not to mention one of the best cups of Greek coffee ever! Love this place. We started out the very next day to eat again but the line was out the door so we passed because it was so hot out. People watching is one of many a yelpers pastime. Mine her was the mid-40 something woman who was in good enough shape to wear he tennis outfit to Meli Cafe and made sure everyone saw her. "Look at Me!!"" Hehehe.
