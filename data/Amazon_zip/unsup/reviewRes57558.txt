This is the kinda place that just makes you wanna become Greek. Food is amazing, Saganaki, Avgalemono soup,Tatamousalata, great appetizers for any party. From the Greek chicken to the beef kabobs everything is amazing. But the best item there has to be the Pastitsio (Greek Lasagna) just makes you cry when you eat it so good
