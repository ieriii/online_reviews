European style gourmet smorgasbord of culinary treats. As much fun to shop here as Michigan Avenue. Love the olive ciabatta bread and spanish salamis. Tempting selection of made-in-Chicago toffees and chocolates, and individual key lime pies. Great truffle fries at the lunch counter, and a great place for eggs benedict and blood orange juice in the morning. A very sweet spot in Streeterville!
