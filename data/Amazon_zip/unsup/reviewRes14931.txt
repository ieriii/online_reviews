Violet Hour is hands down the best cocktail lounge in Chicago. From their Alice in Wonderland ambiance to their crafty cocktails you cannot go wrong at this joint. My girlfriend and I visited last night and not only was their menu full of great drinks but our server was able to recommend some off-menu cocktails based on my girlfriend's fondness of drinks that are both sweet and tart (the National Hotel and the Blinker). I, personally, enjoy whiskey based cocktails and get at least one authentic (with the egg white) whiskey sour each time I visit. I definitely recommend arriving within the first hour it is open or else you risk waiting in line for a long time (and potentially outside). This is a cocktail lounge in every sense of the word and you will not be rushed through your drinks. Which is a great feature if you are inside but if you're waiting for a table you could be waiting for a while.
