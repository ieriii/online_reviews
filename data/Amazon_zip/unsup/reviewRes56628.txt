Absolutely love the food at this place. I'm so tired of being limited to a handful of pasta dishes at Italian restaurants. This place is refreshingly unique with lots of different options. It's a really fun place to go with a large group as the plates are designed to share. Wine selection is also wonderful. Only negative is the fact that they don't take reservations. Really do not like that part.
