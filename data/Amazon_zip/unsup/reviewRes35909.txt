If you're in the mood for a seafood restaurant from the 1970's with no originality or any dish that was invented in this century, you've probably hit the motherload. The restaurant's decor is as if someone asked, what would a generic New England restaurant from yesteryear look like, and manufactured just that. Inside, you'll find all the usual suspects, such as crab shell crackers at the table, various old school silver bowls and table clothes with crabs on them. I don't know when this restaurant was established, but it's safe to say that the menu has never changed. I had the oven roasted halibut with green beans. It was very good quality, but seriously, just that. There was no salt or seasoning. Someone just put a fish fillet in the oven with green beans and then just plated it. Again, the quality of the food is not to be questioned, but it's deliverance is. There are seriously many seafood restaurants in Chicago that keep up with modern trends, and stay sharp against the competion, then there are "classic" seafood restaurant who cater to rich old people who still enjoy Harvey Wallbangers. This is the latter.
