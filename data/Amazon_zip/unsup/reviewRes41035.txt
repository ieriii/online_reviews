My friend first brought me here the day after Gay Pride - we slumped in hungover, and before I knew it, I was wowed. Best Ca Kha To EVER. One week later, I went back and ordered it again. Then I went back on a Wednesday, and it was closed, and I almost shouted from disappointment.  So, ps, I'm broke, and I really shouldn't be going out to eat at ALL. I made a deal with a friend that once we quit our shitty jobs and found new jobs we both liked we would celebrate with a trip to tank and a night of drinking. Unfortunately, once I talked about it, I couldn't get it out of my mind. I went to tank by myself about two hours after our deal. Oops. Once I was in a bad mood, so I comforted myself with a trip to tank. A few days later, it was a beautiful day and I felt on top of the world. So I celebrated with a trip to tank.  My friends are like "shut up already. we're not going to tank. tank sucks."  I think about how wrong they are on my way back to tank.
