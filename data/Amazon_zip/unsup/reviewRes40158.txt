I was celebrating a work success so I took my amazing f'n girlfriend there to celebrate. We ate and drank like royalty. Every course was on par with the recent Michelin star rating... I can't imagine a better celebratory dinner with the spirits, ambiance, and company that make a working class schmuck like me feel like the king of the world... we have since dined at other "Michelin Star restaurants," and have not since had a meal so memorable, besides Schwa. Yes, kids, that's a compliment.  Cheers!
