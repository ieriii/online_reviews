The unfriendly, unwelcoming attitude of the bartending staff is enough to keep me from ever stepping foot in this place again, despite the fact that they have fantastic burgers and a great beer list, It's just not worth it! We spent over $200 in drinks and food & Adam, the bartender, was a complete jerk! I get that they were busy, but I was actually reprimanded for reminding a bartender that I'd like a drink after a 15-20 minute wait AT THE BAR! (This was a different bartender.) I agree with other reviewers that children should not be allowed in this BAR environment in the evening. Save yourself a trip & spend your money somewhere that the staff doesn't act like you're an inconvenience.
