After seeing all the great reviews I was excited to try this place. NASTY is what it was. I ordered bbq pork over rice....it was mostly fat and dry as hell. My boyfriend ordered bbq chicken...it was all bone and no meat! We're both introverts so we just paid for our meals and left.Luckily it was really cheap like only $12 bucks but they have a $14 credit card minimum so we had to buy a drink on top of it all!!! As soon as we got home...that food went in the garbage. I wouldn't even give that to a homeless person!!
