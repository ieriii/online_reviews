I really enjoyed this restaurant. I was a bit skeptical due to the unexpected cafeteria-style line that didn't really seem to be going anywhere. But after waiting about 10 minutes the line started to move and my group of three was at the front pretty quickly. I ordered the wild mushroom sandwich. I'm not a vegetarian, but I have an affinity for mushrooms and goat cheese, both of which came on this sandwich. It was delicious. Just the perfect amount of goat cheese spread, mushrooms, arugula and a nice tomato salsa. I would highly recommend it. My two friends both got sandwiches that they loved. One ordered the Gunthrop and the other the spicy sausage. Both were hits. We got a few orders of chips and salsa -- one order would have been plenty. The sandwiches have a deceivingly small feel but they are filling! We also ordered the churros with hot chocolate. TO DIE FOR! Overall, I look forward to going back. The only draw back is the small space which makes eating with a big group a bit difficult. I would also recommend this restaurant for anyone looking for a great sandwich!
