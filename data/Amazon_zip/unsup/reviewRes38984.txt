Went there a few nights ago with a friend because I just seen it on check please n to begin with my waitress didn't really acknowledge http://us.it took her like 15 min just to get anything.won't mention her name cause I think that's rude.then another 15 to get a box.i got soggy shrimp dipped in egg and my friend got really dry fish.I've had n made halibut n it was nothing like it.then my vegetables smelled like sweat n I tried to eat two pieces n I just couldn't. N I really do like vegies. Anyway I won't b going back
