Going to cut to the cheese ( haha, i made a funny) ..because honestly, im going against the grain by negating such good reviews. I really really get excited to go to pizza joints because pizza is my LIFE. YES, ill even eat subway's pizza, its that pathetic. That being said, dont hate me for my average review. Appeteizer: We got the pizza bread. Do you know what ELIOs pizza is? If you don't, its the one that comes in a box and is almost always on sale at every grocery store. The pizza bread here was along those lines. I think i prefer elios, that way i know how much i want to melt my cheese, or how crispy i want it. Or if im feeling fancy, i may put it in the oven. The pizza bread here didnt taste good at all. The cheese was not melted right and the bread tasted old. 1 Star. Pizza: It was AVERAGE. The dough was nice and hot, it was okay, and i enjoyed the fact that the pizza had multiple layers of cheese and dough. The sauce tasted like it came right out of the can and the dough was kinda bland. But the very end of the pizza, the crust.... CARAMELIZED CRUST-the saving grace of this pizza. The carameilized crust was PHENOMENAL and if they made the entire pizza dough with that taste, i would be in heaven. They need to sell the crust and make it an appitizer on its own, with some melted cheese , semi burning. YUM. So, i wont be returning for the pizza. Service: crappy. The waitress never came around to fill our waters. There was one obnoxious server who kept laughing like a hyena and it was really annoying. All the servers were just chillin by the bar serving their own. IDK, didnt like it. She finally came around to fill our water when the pizza came. Overall: OVERHYPED PLACE. You are paying money just for the crust ( which is amazing and why this place even got 3 stars) . Do not buy a t shirt, its not worth it. Go to PIECE on Chicago Ave instead.
