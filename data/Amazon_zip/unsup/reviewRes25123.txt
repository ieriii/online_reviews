I was really excited to check this place out, but the steep prices and extra tiny tapas left me lukewarm on the place. Everything we had was good, but nothing blew me away enough that I'd pick Mercat a la Planxa over a less expensive tapas place. My boyfriend and I had three plates and a pitcher of sangria and that set us back $80. We realized we couldn't make a full meal out of this place without going broke. The sangria was supposed to be some seasonal pomegranate flavor, but it tasted like standard sangria to me. And I've had bacon-wrapped dates at almost every tapas place in the city, and these were middle of the pack (my favorite ones are at Twist). At Mercat a la Planxa you only get four bacon-wrapped dates when you'd get at least six or so (just as good dates) at another place for half the price. The one bright spot in the cost-to-size ratio was the cheese we ordered. We got two large and yummy pieces of cheese with a great pear dipping sauce. The room was beautiful and the service was attentive, but I think I'll stick to other less expensive tapas places in the future if I want to have a filling meal without going broke -- especially if I'm going out with a group.
