I have a problem... sometimes when I eat something really delicious I dream about it. This is the case with wildfire. The horseradish crusted filet is amazing! If you're not sure about it, order the three medallions. Never fails to be excellent. I don't know how people could not like it here! Great wine list and great food. What else can one ask for?
