Really 3.5. Grading on a curve here. GNO in the house!!! Right off the red line. Crab ragoon was interesting and prepared in a way I had never seen before. It was prepared looking like a Beggars' Purse. Beautiful to look at and fresh tasting. Another lovely yelper and I shared: -Butter Ocean Asparagus Tempura, cream cheese, smoked salmon wrapped with shrimp and avocado. Topped with spicy butter. -Dragon roll Shrimp tempura, cucumber and mayo wrapped with broiled eel and avocado. Both amazing presentations. BYOB. 2 rooms. Attentive staff.
