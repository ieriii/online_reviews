I've been going to Coast since 2008. It has some of the best sushi in chicago but somehow doesnt get as much hype as japonais, sunda, or sushi wabi. It's BYOB so that's a plus, although when they first opened, you could bring in whatever and however much you wanted. now, you can only bring in 1 bottle of wine or a 6pack of beer for every two people and they charge a corkage fee. the sushi rolls, sashimi, and nigiri are spectactular though. the service is just OK... a little slow. also, you can't make reservations, so i suggest walking in, putting your name down, and then running to the liquor store down the street and getting a bottle of wine. by the time you get back, a table should be available.  another plus is they have fresh wasabi.  yum! it's very affordable and i think it has the best sushi for the price you pay. scene/decor is just OK. my final ratings: food=10, scene/decor=5, service=7, prices=10.
