Fun food that tickles the senses. The quality of the experience thankfully eclipsed the drunk old woman first teetering in the hallway, then yakking in the Alinea bathroom, when I first arrived.   The moral of the story is not to drink the wine flight unless you can hold your liquor better than an Irish frat boy. Otherwise, you might not remember the tasty, and really pricey, meal.
