My friends were surprised that I have never eaten at Superdawg's - it's a Chicago Staple. I lived here for about 6 years and my reason for taking so long is because I DONT HAVE CAR. Sure, I can take the Foster Bus and the Milwaukee Bus up there, but I don't want to wait more than hour just to eat a Hot Dog. Who does? Well maybe some people do - but I'm not that hardcore. When I finally had access to one, my family and I got there in 15 minutes. We all got the Superdawg and my brother got the burger. What a mistake that was. Now why would you go to a place that is known for the hot dog's and get a burger? Beats me, but all I know is that it sucked. The dogs were great, nice and juicy with that nice "crunch" when you bite into it - the fries not so much. There were a bit soggy and bland. My hopes is to stumble around this place during the late light - I wanna see what kind crowd this place brings. It's always fun to people watch.
