Took my woman on a long overdue date here last month and it was f-in good. I've read a lot of reviews about crowds and having to wait so my game plan was to go in and put my name and number down, then go across the street to grab a drink. They told us it'd be an hour to and hour and a half. The host ends up calling me 35 min later, which was awesome and led us to the table. The special that day was 5 dollar martinis so we got a couple of those and started with an arugula butternut squash salad. It also had some type of grain, nuts and a soft cheese. Really delicious for 2 bites, then it kind of got filling and old, but we killed it anyways We then had the Ragu of the day which was a trio of braised meats, I believe house made sausage, veal, and beef on polenta, which they served up table side, it was phenomenal. Next course was the crab and sea urchin linguini. Pasta was al dente, the sauce and seafood were so good. At this point we were pretty stuffed. But, we also ordered a pizza, not thinking it was going to be that big. But nope, it was a normal sized big pizza. We opted for the pork belly, yukon potato, and egg pizza. It was so good. Seriously. It was good. No room for desert, but I got a beer. It was beer. Service was totally on point, she gave us great suggestions and was very knowledgeable. Price for 4 courses and 3 drinks - 60 bucks. What a steal. This place is awesome.
