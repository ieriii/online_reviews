maybe they should rename it "dana nightclub and oh yeah a hotel".  we can't go up to our rooms using the elevators on the ground floor, because those are reserved for the nightclub guests. so you have to go to the second floor using another elevator, then wait for a free elevator since they are mostly full of people going up to the club. my cell phone and the house phone don't work in my room.i put a DO NOT DISTURB on my door, and they came in anyway, more than once while I was away. they also disposed of my DO NOT DISTURB notice, so now I can't even try to keep them out.I can hear everyone coming and going in the hallway outside my room which is right by the elevators.no one helped us with our bags coming or going on more than one occasion. my room key has had to be replaced, i couldn't get up to my room on the elevator because of this, having to go back downstairs to re-key is one of my pet peeves. the wait staff is good.won't come back.
