I'm on my way back to Chicago for restaurant show this weekend...then my wife reminded me that we will NOT bevisiting this place again. The last time was so bad I blacked it of my mind I guess. Amazing how one really BAD employee will do that to you. She was about 5'5' tall "Barback"? Had the Marilyn Manson tattoo addidction all over her neck and she was deaf mute ..or at least acted that way...All we were trying was spend money...but NOOOOOOO she wouldn't have it...so we didn't....and won't, ever again.
