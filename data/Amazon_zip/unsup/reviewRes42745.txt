Agree never get the BBQ Pizza. If you want a good BBQ pizza get it NY Style. Deep dish and BBQ sauce is bad idea. If you stay away from the BBQ Pizza you should be great. The leftovers are good the next day. Again I can't say this enough don't get the BBQ Pizza, if anything ask them to take it off the menu or put up some sort of warning.
