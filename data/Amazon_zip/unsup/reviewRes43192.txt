Appears like this is the hot new entry into the Chicago dining scene (straight out of NYC), which made it well worth checking out. So, does Gilt Bar live up to the hype? That all depends on what you're looking for. If you seek a River North establishment with a cool lounge vibe and dark interior, look no further. If you want service that goes to great lengths to kiss your ass and answer your every whim, come on in. I know this might sound crazy but it's almost possible to be trying too hard from a service standpoint, but Gilt Bar will have at least four different people ask you at any given moment how your experience is. They do seem to try hard, which is somewhat refreshing. How does the food rate? Very tasty, at least what they give you of it. Portions are shockingly miniscule, so prepare to order loads of appetizers or simply come in on a full stomach. Maybe not absolute perfection but my companion absolutely loved the mushroom truffle pasta, so we'll likely return.
