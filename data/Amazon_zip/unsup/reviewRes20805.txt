Although there is always a line, XOCO has a fantastically organized system. They temporarily stop taking orders when there are no seats available so at times the line will stop. This is an excellent idea because otherwise you would have nowhere to sit and it would be total chaos serving this many people. Of course the line is somewhat due to Rick Bayless's Top Chef win however I wouldn't be surprised to see it continue even after the fad has worn off with the tourists. When someone is doing something special, you are happy to wait in line. After ordering you are escorted to a seat and your food arrives surprisingly quickly. What can I say that hasn't been said already? The food is exceptional at any price, even though it is not much more expensive than any sandwich shop. I had the Ahodaga torta (pork carnitas sandwich) which was served dipped in a bowl of broth reduction with intense tomato/lime flavor. It had what I call a "zing" with the perfect combination of acidity in which to dunk the torta. The hot chocolate is rich and delicious, I highly recommend it. The guacamole is the same that is served next door, which would be your standard guacamole - that is if your standard guacamole is made with avocados at their peak of ripeness and you use roasted tomatoes instead of regular. Take my advice and order about 20 churros to go because you will not want to stop eating them! Somehow the ordinary is made extraordinary. I look forward to my next visit.
