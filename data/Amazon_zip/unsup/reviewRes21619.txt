First Visit: I had a Mojito (nice and strong) and Chicken Adobo while my friend had a Banana Margarita (strong lacking the slightest hint of banana) and a Combination Platter. Sadly, it was she who wanted Mexican at the time and 2/3 items on her plate were either intolerably hot or slathered in what tasted like bbq sauce. Would've loved to sit in the front room for the ambiance.However, we trekked down a skinny hallway to what reminded me of boarding an airplane- you go from first class, down a long line to till you get to economy class. In this big room were longer tables filled with noisy happy parties. Our server probably had good intentions, but it appeared the most attentive representative the entire visit was another server possibly manager who placed his hands on his hips, bent his knees, hunched over, looked us in the eye and asked "Is everything doing fine?" His condescending posture and charismatic grin led me to believe the next words out of his mouth were going to be "Hows about we get you a sippy cup for that mojito?" Aside from his demeanor, which we both found funny, the food needs some fine tuning- or we need a do-over. In all, until I come again, preferably in one of those jovial half-priced margarita fueled parties, MPMC stands as an all right place
