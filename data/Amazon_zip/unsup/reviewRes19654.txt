This place has excellent sushi for the price (not cheap nor expensive, but great quality). The salmon and yellowtail had excellent flavors. Great trendy atmosphere with candlelit tables. The places gets very, very busy on weekend evenings. So be prepared to wait. They have some couches dispersed in the restaurant and near the entrance so you can enjoy your BYOB wine while you wait your 30-60 minutes. BYOB with no corkage fee the bill is more than 15$ per person. Street parking on Damen can be had if you are persistent and quick. Good date restaurant. Okay with groups of people, but be warned about the wait time to get a table set up to accommodate you all (and the automatic 20% (post-tax) tip/service charge tacked onto your bill if you have five or more people .
