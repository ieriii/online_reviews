This is my favorite Pizza spot in the North side of the City! The pizza is nice and thin with the perfect amount of cheese to sauce ratio. The beer selection is also great. They make their own beers, plus they carry many other brands as well. My wife is a huge fan of the Chicken Cesar Salad, she says they have large pieces that are always very lean. Definitely recommend this place, the atmosphere is also great for just a casual meal or game day.
