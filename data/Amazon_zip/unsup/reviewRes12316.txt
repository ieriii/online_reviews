LUV.  Truly wonderful experience. From the spicy butter for your bread to my DELICIOUS F-ing marg to the mouth watering tamale appetizer to the savory halibut I had. It was pleasantries all the way through. Service was probably slower, because of the busy-ness but they truly make some seriously delicious food and the experience is completely different than your traditional mexican fair... its very upscale, but not in your face. The cuban aspects allow for new flavors and I just loved it... I can't wait to go back and try something else!
