For the past 5 years, I've been on the prowl for the perfect Mexican restaurant in the city in terms of price and quality (I'm Asian, so sue me) -- ladies and gents, I think this is it! Tuesday and Thursday nights: 1/2 off Margaritas. You know what that means. Yup! Sign me up! The frozen margaritas here are the best I've ever had in my life. So darn delicious. I'm not usually a drinker, but I can definitely get my groove on here. These margaritas not only soothe over the stress of your day at the office but save you money on therapy. Yes -- these margaritas are medicinal in every sense. The Mayan Chimichanga was perfectly crisp -- not too thick of a tortilla, but actually on the thin, crispy side -- perfection. It tasted fantastic. The guacamole rivals my own (I'm sad to admit this). Just the right amount of cilantro. I only wished it were a larger portion, but hey -- I'm a piggy, so I can't knock them for that. Will be returning for "therapy" for sure -- especially on Tuesdays and Thursdays!
