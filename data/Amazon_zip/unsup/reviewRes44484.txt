Alliance Rocks... They have the best coffee there and little pastries/treats all over the place.  I used to go to get the Mexican hot chocolate which was wicked sweet.  However they no longer serve the Mexican hot chocolate. Apparently the coco beans come from some remote region of Mexico and are exported via mule's. From there I think they might either Air lift them to Chicago or some sort of high speed freight train.  Either way I love the Alliance Bakery & Cafe and if you are wise you will go there soon.
