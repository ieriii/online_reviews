Stopped in for lunch on a Tuesday and had no problem snagging a booth. My friend and I started with the Pequod salad which was great; then we both got the $4.95 lunch special and had a beer + personal pizza. Now, lets start with the good....friendly service, cool atmosphere, buttery, doughy yet crispy crust. What didn't I like? HERBS in my sauce. Personal preference coming through but I knew as soon as my pizza was set in front of me I wouldn't fully enjoy it. The sauce makes or breaks a pizza for me and I do not like "green things" in my sauce. I promise I am not 2 years old, I just think the best sauce is simple - san marzano tomatoes, garlic, salt, and pepper. The other thing I thought was missing was layers! I like the deep dish formula where you do cheese, sauce, cheese, sauce and the one layer on Pequod's variation just didn't do it for me! You can't beat the price on the lunch special, even though I didn't even eat half it was a good value.
