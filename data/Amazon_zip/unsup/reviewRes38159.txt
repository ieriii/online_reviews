I don't know what that guy is talking about. Lot of the customers I see are foreigners(including my husband) so to say it's all hicks is not true. We usually go to the one in Rogers Park since it's walking distance. The best Deep Dish Pizza around,if you want to try Chicago Style pizza this is the place. It is heavy though,one piece can fill you up. I don't recommend eating it 24/7,especially if you are trying to maintain your weight. I love all kinds of pizza,and I told my husband we gotta try the thin crust,since we always get deep dish. Last week we ordered to go and the owner made an error where it didn't get entered in the computer. For this he apologized and only charged 10 bucks for a large deep dish,which was totally cool of him.He even bought us some drinks. So the service is great as well.
