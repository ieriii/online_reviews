This is nearly as good as it gets for a laid back BYOB experience with excellent service and incredible seafood. Now I remember coming here a few years back and thinking my mahi mahi or was it sword fish was a little dry. However, this week I had the sturgeon and absolutely loved it. Even though I am from Wisconsin where this fish is plentiful I had never had it before. Glenn's sturgeon comes from Washington which was disappointing since Wisconsin is known for it and certainly a lot closer for the eco footprint concern. Nevertheless, the waitress explained it perfectly as a cross between those meatier fish and the flakier kind. Very yummy. Only complaint is the bacon sauce that I would usually enjoy almost overwhelmed the perfectly cooked and mild fish. Also, The potatoes lacked flavor. And the mussle appetizer had a little grit.  But the service was excellent, street parking was plentiful right in front of the restaurant and well lit. There is a $5 corkage fee and the sturgeon was pricey at $24 - one of the most expensive items on the menu along with the scallops and tuna. Most items are cheaper. The menu is really extensive for such a small place but it is very fresh and yummy. My fellow diners also loved the pecan crusted trout. The place was packed on a Tuesday night. We had 7:30 reservations and were allowed to sit just before our fourth arrived. Never too many people standing and waiting though. There isn't any space for them. My guess is the place takes on a very different vibe in the morning when they are serving all those boxes of sugary cereal that decorate the back wall. I have never been but it's a nice exposed brick type place and I would recomend it.
