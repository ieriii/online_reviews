Great craft beer and great burgers. You won't find Bud or Miller on the taps at this place. :) Trust me, I know - I overhead someone ask! They have GREAT craft beers on tap at reasonable prices and you can have samples of some brews before you buy a glass. They have all different types of beer to fit all drinkers - from delicious darks to light lambics. The burgers are great and are a good bang for your buck. You can add seasoning to your fries for 75 cents. I recommend the chipolte seasoning. Oh and don't miss the cheese curds! They are a great way to start the meal. The staff is friendly and very helpful with the beer suggestions as well.
