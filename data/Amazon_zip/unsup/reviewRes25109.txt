Finally got to check out Geja's during restaurant week. It totally lived up to the hype. By far the best thing about this place is the atmosphere. So cozy and romantic. You just want to stay forever. However, the food was also notable. The cheese fondue was THE BEST. My philosophy in life is that everything is better with cheese, so I basically just wanted to drink this stuff. I restrained myself, but wasn't happy about it. Besides being delicious, the whole meal was just fun. My boyfriend and I are not very good at managing our fondue (stuff was falling off those little sticks left and right), but honestly that was all part of the fun. Here's a little lesson we learned: don't put too much stuff in the pot at once. We ended up cooking everything pretty quickly. Next time I'd only do one or two things at a time to slow down the pace of the meal. You get so much food here that taking it slow is the best way to make sure it all fits in your tummy! My only tiny complaint is that the smell of propane does take away from your romantic meal a bit, but what can they really do about that? All in all, this is one of my new favorite places in Chicago. Oh, and another tip from my friend KT S. - "wear expandable pants."
