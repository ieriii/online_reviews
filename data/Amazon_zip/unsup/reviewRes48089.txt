Did Chef Paul Kahan come up with this restaurant just for me? Oysters, Seafood, Pork, and Craft Beer. Hell yes! Chicago has so many wonderful places to eat, but as of now the publican is my favorite. The quality of all the of the food and preparation of the dishes is incredible. Oysters have always been super fresh and every time I have been in there has been a new type for me to try. The beer program is out of this world too. Had a very eclectic Belgian sour on tap to pair with the oysters on suggestion of the very knowledgeable bartender. One of the best food and beer pairings ever. Mussels always cooked perfectly, charcuterie made in house, fries with fried egg on top are some of my favorites. Yes, everything does taste better with a fried egg. The staff has always taken care of me and offered excellent advice on dishes to try and beer/food parinings. Since I'm not a big fan of chatting it up with people I dont know, I like to sit at the bar and avoid the communal tables.
