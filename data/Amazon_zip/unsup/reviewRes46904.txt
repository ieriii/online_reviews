My sister and I had brunch here on Christmas Eve. This place is amazing! I had some kind of french toast dish with honey butter and chicken sausage. OMG! I also had a seasonal beverage which was a chai tea-apple cider hybrid ("chaider"). It was okay, but I'd not order it again. I'd order either beverage on its own, or one of their many others. My sister had an omelet of some kind which she completely loved. (Can't wait to have an excuse to go back when the budget allows).
