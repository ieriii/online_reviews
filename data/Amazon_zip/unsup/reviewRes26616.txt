I was there with my sister and her husband on the Sunday of the NATO summit. There was a line up- maybe twenty folks ahead of us. It was hot and there were audible grumbles about finding a place with no wait from those ahead of us. The hosts and waitstaff amazed everyone by getting all parties down in minutes. Three salsas, tortilla chips, and cups of chicken caldo were in front of us minutes after that. We ordered a kind of queso fundido with chorizo over soft tortillas, creamy and plentiful guacamole, pork tamales, chicken mole poblano, a vegetarian burrito (my sister- she loved it) and glasses of horchata and limonada. The food was outstanding and we took home a lot. The service really knocked it out of the park. AND there was a man with an ice cream cart parked out front who made me really happy with a palate cleansing lime ice afterwards.
