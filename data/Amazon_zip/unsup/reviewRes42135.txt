Only have eaten here once...but it was the best Chicago deep dish I've ever had! Even the leftovers were great, better than most deep dish that I've had fresh. As usual, I don't give 5 stars to any place I've not been to multiple times that proves they're consistent and amazing. Looking forward to going back so I can bump this up to 5 stars!
