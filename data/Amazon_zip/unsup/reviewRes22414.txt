2 stars because I love Sichuan food (Sichuan being my home province) and had high expectations from the reviews. But was sorely disappointed. Dish 1: Dongpo pork - it came out slightly spicy and a lot tangy/sour...which is definitely not how this dish should taste. (Picture attached) Maybe it's their own take on it, but to me it was a fail. Dish 2: Spicy fish filet with pickled veggies - this dish was super sour and not nearly spicy enough, not even to the Americanized spicy level. Now some sourness is expected because of the pickled veggies, but here it was so overwhelming that I had to neutralize every bite with a mouthful of rice. Yet another fail for me. Perhaps I should have stuck to the signature dishes like spicy stewed beef or twice cooked pork. But the dishes I tried did not live up to the good reviews or level of authenticity expected.
