What could be better than pizza and beer? Piece does both really, really well.  First, the beer. I like to stick with Piece's own brews, but they have a nice selection of other beers, too. As for their own brews, I'm obsessed with their heffeweizen. Seriously, I've had dreams about it. It's just a little spicy at the end. Perfection in a glass! Sadly, on my latest visit to Piece, they weren't serving the heffeweizen. I tried the Amarillo Brillo, instead. Another slam dunk! I'm not sure how to describe it other than a slightly less bitter Fat Tire with a citrusy hint. Now, the pizza. It's the perfect thin crust pizza. Perfectly chewy. We had the white pizza (which means just olive oil, garlic, and cheese) with clams and garlic. Topping choices range from the traditional (pepperoni) to the truly original (mashed pototoes!). They even have banana peppers listed as a topping, which was like finding the holy grail for me.
