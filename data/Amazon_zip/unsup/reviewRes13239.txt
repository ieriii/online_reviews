There were a few weeks where one could make the argument that I practically lived here. Revolution Brewing is my favorite restaurant in all of Chicago. Just a hop away off of the California Blue Line stop. If you drive, there is only street parking, however there are ALWAYS spots on Milwaukee and Belden, just south of California. I love the atmosphere here. It's always packed when I go, however it never feels crowded. They have a nice little waiting area sectioned off that you can sit and order beer while you wait for a seat. They have also expanded to a second floor within the last year which has really helped the wait time. Beer: Always a great selection. Something for everyone. The Coup D'etat and Eugene Porter are my go to's. I'm a stout lover and I went once where they were out of the two stouts that I initially ordered. The waiter then came back with samples of 5 different porters and stouts they had available. Great service. Food: Bacon popcorn. This is what initially drew me to this place. I will say, that 50% of the time I order this appetizer, it isn't fresh and is...dare I say even stale. It's still delicious though, it's just that it's to die for when you get a freshly made batch. I have never had a bad meal here. Burgers are tasty and cooked exactly how you want them. Pizzas are just the right size and the sauce is just right. Their garlic mashed potatoes....can't get enough. I rarely can even make it to dessert here, but I have tried the Eugene Chocolate cake and it was fantastic, rich and chocolately. I've had a couple dents in the service here, however they are always quick to accommodate and make it up to you. Once, my waitress forgot to bring us our order of bacon popcorn and didn't remember until we were done with our meal. For that, it was on the house without us asking. Another time, I had to send my burger back twice because it was made incorrectly. The manager came out and apologized to me, and gave us a round of drinks for free.
