We checked this place out last week. The chicken/wings are great. Order that. This place might have the best wings I have ever had... I think the BBQ ones (not regular bbq sauce at all) were better then the Seoul Sassy everyone else seems to rave about- but I like things spicy. Avoid everything else. The bowls were gross. You can get much better ones at other Korean places. Also, would like to know if this place is BYOB. There were no signs in the window so my friend and I felt strange bringing in beer. Beer would be a nice compliment to the wings/chicken.
