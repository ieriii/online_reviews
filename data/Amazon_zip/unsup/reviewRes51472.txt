I ordered the queso fundido which was as good as it gets in my opinion. I also ordered mini flautas which never came. I think our waitress had things on her mind. She was hanging on the please wait to be seated sign, staring into space.  They've remodeled and you should see the bathrooms. There are more stalls than at O'Hare.
