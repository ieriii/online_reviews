I ventured to this place on friday 6/5/09 and I must say I was highly impressed. The service was amazing, the food was excellent. I ordered the Quesadillas which were too die for and my friend ordered the chicken sandwhich which was also to die for. What I like most about the place was that it was cute and cozy unpretentious environment. They had 3 live acts come on stage which were amazing. And I cannot forget about the wonderful beers we had. I ordered the Goose Island night stalker TOO DIE FOR and my friend ordered the flossmoor station 'pullman' brown ale which had hints of chocolate absolutely delish. I would definitely recommend this place again, it is a little on the pricey side but it's worth it because the food is fresh and organic and plus you get live entertainment you can't beat that.
