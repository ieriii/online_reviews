I did the call in/pick up and knew from the moment I walked in the food was going to be exquisite. Tea was offered as I waited and the wonderful staff went out of their way to make sure I had reading material and was comfortable for the 5 minute wait. Once I got home we couldn't believe how thoughtfully the food was prepared/packed. But once we began to enjoy the food we kept looking at each other and saying Mmmmmm! This is THE ONLY place for for wonderfully delicious you won't be disappointed food!
