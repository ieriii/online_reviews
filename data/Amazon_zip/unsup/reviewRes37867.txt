Amazing pizza! Much better than Pizza Uno, not to mention the wait was not nearly as painful. One small deep dish could easily be shared between two people with left overs. Three people as long as everyone is not overly hungry. The deep dish does take 45 minutes to cook but they allow you put in your order while you wait for you table. Both times I've been there we've gotten a garlic bread appetizer to hold us over. Very reasonably priced as well. The service wasn't the best I've ever had, the waitress seemed very timid and nervous, not to mention slow. However, the pizza is so good here that it was easy to look past. We ended up taking the remaining two slices back on the bus with us to Michigan. The warmed up version of this pizza doesn't do the fresh out of the oven version just however. If you're in Chicago and you love, or even just like, pizza you must come here!
