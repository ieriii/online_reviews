Great brews, and pretty decent food. I thought the options of food were great but when it came down to taste and quality of food I thought they were OK. I would slate this as typical bar food place. The place looks amazing, and it looks like the menu will be seasonal! Over all the staff was super friendly and knowledgeable and would most definitely go back!
