Went here the other night. Great place! Small plates style. Pate was great, more like a mousseline. Truffle toast is a must as is the crab linguini.  Wine supposedly is regular store price with a $7 corkage fee.  Would definitely return. Only thing is they don't take reservations...so you may have to wait. Great place for the area.
