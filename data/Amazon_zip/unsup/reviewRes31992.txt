Absolutely one of my new favorite restaurants in CHITOWN! From the staff to the atmosphere to the food-ALL 5 stars!!! The owners really outdone themselves with their new addition to the Rockit Ranch group.  The hamachi roll was one of my favorites, the duck salad and the miso cod. You will need a reservation even if dining at 10:00 pm.
