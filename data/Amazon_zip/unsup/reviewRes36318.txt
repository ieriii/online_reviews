I am a sucker for sweet little breakfast places, and have always wanted to pop in and check this place out. I would in all honestly give Meli three-and-a-half stars, but the service was so professional and the ambiance were so precious I decided to be generous. Half a star, schmalf a schmar. We were seated promptly and the waitress was attentive and helpful. Iced tea arrived quickly, food came out in a timely manner, and cups stayed full of coffee. I can definitely see how weekends would be a total zoo, as the layout is a bit tight. The tables and chairs were very comfortable, however, and the window seats are superfun because then you can watch the unique assortment of individuals walking in and out of the vaguely occultist Athenian candlestore across the street. No, for serious. The breakfast menu is very focused on eggs and pancakes, perfect for scratching that "I want a YUMMY omelet/waffle/skillet" itch. I had the eggwhite omelet with veggies, which was a solid dish, and the yogurt parfait, which was the real winner. My companion had some sort of skillet, which could have fed three people, and the toast with that kickass marmalade. Toast is toast, but toast with real jam and fresh butter is GOOOOOOOOOD! Overall, a very enjoyable experience. I would love to go back and sample some of their smoothies and juices soon.
