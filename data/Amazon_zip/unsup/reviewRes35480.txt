Classic Chicago dining experience.....high end with a beautiful dining room. We arrived around 11:30 am and were immediately seated by the very well dressed GM....he was excellent and very friendly. Not the waitress, she had a personality like a frying pan (best way I can describe), was not real quick and certainly not friendly. Food was a bit slow to arrive, I had the salmon and it was just ok - not good/bad - just ok. Connie had the salad and the waitress forgot the seafood for it...and when we let her know if took at least another 10 minuets for it to arrive. I think it would be much nicer experience just to have a drink in the classy bar. Connie paid and I didn't get to see the check! Would not return for lunch.
