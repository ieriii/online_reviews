They give you enough food for at least two meals, so it's worth paying $16 bucks for "one" meal. The food is delicious. I highly recommend the Shirin Polo if you're looking for something sweet and savory. The kabobs are sometimes lacking meat, but still tasty. The rice - dill or white, is plentiful and full of flavor. Part of why I like recommending it is being able to say the name - Noon O Kabab. It's fun. Try it.
