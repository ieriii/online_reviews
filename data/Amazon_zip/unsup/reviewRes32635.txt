I have been here a few times and only half the time I have left impressed. One of the last times I was here I had the BBQ Bacon cheeseburger. It was so fricken good! My boyfriend took it off my plate and helped me eat it. He had the chickin parmesan sandwich he did not like it. The last time we went there my boyfriend ordered the BBQ bacon cheeseburger, and I decided to try something different. I ordered the chikin ranch sandwich. Ugh, I did not like it! Also, their sweet potato fries are sick. Might as well have normal french fries. I would prefer them. However for dessert we had the cocoa mousse cake, so fricken good! If you are not impressed with their lunch or dinner selections at least stop in for coffee and a slice of cake! YUM!
