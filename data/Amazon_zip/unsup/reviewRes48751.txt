It met all my expectations, that's for sure. The three hams were intoxicating, and I had some of the best sirloin i've ever tasted. The frites were good, and the pork rinds are just fun to try out. The atmosphere is busy and the communal dining can be a little painful at times, but the food makes it worth the experience overall.
