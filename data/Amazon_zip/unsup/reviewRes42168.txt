I really love the food and decor, here... It's very gossip girl meets foodie's dream- the cornbread is obsession-worthy BUT, the service can be a little too pretentious. Been there 5+ times but, the last time the waitress was horrible, opting to give the hostess a backrub at the hostess stand while we waited for everything from napkins, water and the check. Regardless of this, I still decided to make a Bday reservation here, 4 months in advance, just to call back and confirm and was told that there was no reservation. Whether it's fate or an honest mistake, I am quite disappointed and have decided to go elsewhere to celebrate. This is Chicago, afterall, great restaurants are plentiful. There is an epidemic of bad service in this city and it will only change if consumers decide not to frequent such places until changes have been made!
