We came here for the lunchtime prix fixe menu. I had the grilled pork, pho and spring rolls. The pork was too salty and the pho was good, but nothing compared to what you will find on Argyle. The fried pork and shrimp spring rolls are very authentic and the best I have ever had. I really dig the interior - lots of dark wood and high pressed ceilings. You can also get a good view of Rush street on the patio in the summer.
