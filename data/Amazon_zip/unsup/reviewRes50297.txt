The Fifty/50 is aptly named because you can either take it or leave it. This establishment that takes the place of failed Bravo tries to breathe some fresh air into the location. By the crowds that show up it appears that it is succeeding in doing so. The crowd that frequents this location seems to be spill over from the Lincoln Park bar scene. Determined by the number of popped collars and 40's that populate this spot on the weekends. This is the place to go if you want to go to a Lincoln Park spot outside of Lincoln Park but this is not my cup of tea.
