After a long time without visiting, I've returned to Spacca Napoli a few times recently for some al fresco dining. The patio is great and the service is just as attentive outside as in. I'm less enthused about the crust than I was on my first visit. The middle of the pizza always seems to get a little soggy and it's hard to eat without a knife and fork. Still, the flavor is as delicious as ever. Also, they accept A La Card. Still a little pricey even with the discount, but worth it to sit outside on a nice summer day.
