Wonderful meal. Had a little problem with a mix up in the reservation but they quickly worked to rectify this while we had a drink at the beautiful bar. Ceasar was nice. Filet on bone was perfectly cooked. Wonderful Mac n cheese (not so perfect brussels and sweet pot fries). Service was excellent, we had a blast. The butter cake for the table will be remembered for quite some time!
