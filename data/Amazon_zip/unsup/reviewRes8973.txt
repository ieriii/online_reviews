One of the best persian eateries in the city. I find the portions substantial and the quality excellent. Start with kash-ke-bademjan (think hummus but with eggplant instead of chickpeas) and complimentary tandoori with feta. Namesake kabobs are juicy and flavorful. End your meal with a serving of hot tea and some zulbia or bamieh --- I liken it to crisp funnel cake with saffron honey on top.
