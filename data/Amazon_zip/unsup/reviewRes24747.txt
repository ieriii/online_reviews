I would give this place 5 stars because of how much I love the food and fun of fondue, but this place is virtually impossible to go to on a Friday or Saturday night without being seated right on someones lap. The tables are just too close together and when it's crowded your in someone's conversation that you may not want to be. Anyway, hit this place on a weeknight and enjoy because it is amazing.
