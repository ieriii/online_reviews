I think i found my new favorite sushi place! We had: gyoza salmon tartar appetizer hamachi toro mexicana roll - yellowtail, cilantro, jalapeno, spicy sauce, avocado, lime Special (dragon?) roll - with spicy scallops, avocado topped with salmon and black tobiko. Everything was SUPER awesome, except the Toro, which is usually the softest most melt in your mouth kind of nigiri out there, was tough and very disappointing. We sat on the outside patio. It was glorious!
