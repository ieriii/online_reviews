An amazing culinary experience that I won't forget. Every course was detailed and crafted and served on special made dinner ware. Each wine was well paired to enhance it's accompanying course. The staff was friendly and fun and not stuffy at all. They would even joke around with us as we kidded about the night. The savory courses were all so good and I wish they had more of the savory and less of the sweet courses. As the night drew on I was eagerly awaiting the final dessert course because I had read how Chef Achatz comes out to create it using the entire table. Watching him was like watching a cross between artist and a lab scientist. I had only wish that Achatz would have been a bit more conversational with our table but I'm sure he has much to do and many other tables to deal with. As we devoured the amazing dessert in record time, we asked the staff that if anybody had ever licked the table clean. They said some people have come pretty close to it. We did get allowed to tour the kitchen at the end of dinner and it was much smaller than I thought and filled with 20+ cooks all in a well coordinated production line style of cooking. Despite the final cost of it all, I'm glad I did it.
