The most romantic cafe - not for my taste. They've tried their best, therefore the 5 stars. It is a small place, smells like grease and there is no oxygen to breathe- my eyes were swollen and itchy after 1 hour spent in there. The food is expensive. I would recommend to try it just once- it is an interesting experience.
