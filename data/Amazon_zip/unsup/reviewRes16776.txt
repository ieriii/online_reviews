Stimulation overload! I'll make it short since I'm only the 2 millionth person to review... - Decor is badass, great look-around kind of place. - Great people watching. - Staff is surprisingly charming for a place this gigantic. - The food is stupid-good. Put it in your mouth as fast as you can. - The drinks are what you'd expect from a big frou frou place like this. - F those fingerpointing naysayers who say you're a trendy schmoe for going here, it's worth it.
