Monte Cristo!!! He was the Prince of the ball! Was Monte Cristo a man? At any rate. You must try the brunch at Longman & Eagle. This is not your everyday monte cristo but the perfect balance of sweet and savory. I can't further describe my love for the restaurant any better than the other hundreds of positive reviews. So stop reading and researching and just GOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
