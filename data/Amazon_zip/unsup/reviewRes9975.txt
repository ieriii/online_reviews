I've waited 5 months to go here, waited a long time for a table (although there were 5 tables open). Had to eventually ask if we were going to get seated, then a guy sat us but was really rude. Then the waitress hadn't came to the table for 20 minutes and we had to ask a bus boy to find us a waiter/waitress. She showed up to the table and said "I heard you're ready to order" in a snotty voice. She was putting our beer order in and threw a pizza pan onto the table next to us. Needless to say, we ended up finishing one round of beers and leaving because the service was so bad. If I was the GM at this restaurant, I would be appalled at my waitstaff.
