Where do I start... Service: Unbelievable, they have numerous servers, bussers, and managers floating around ready to jump when you say jump. They are on tables like white on rice! Now yes some people don't like to be pampered like this but I do and found it quite enjoyable. Food:  Simple menu which is good, they choose a few items to master and they did just that. This was my first time there and I had the pulled pork sandwich. This was by far the best pulled pork sandwich I had ever tasted in my life. With your sandwich they bring you a plate full of different sauces you can add but the pork is so flavorful you don't even need it. You will not leave there hungry. They serve you huge portions and they bring you endless homemade BBQ chips and sweet pickles from the start. Very impressed with my entire visit and will most defiantly be back!
