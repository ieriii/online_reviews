I loved The Purple Pig! A chef friend told me to go when I came to Chicago and man, am I glad I did! We didn't want to risk the long wait for dinner since they don't take reservations, so we came for a late lunch/snack to hold us over for our dinner later. We got there around 4 and were seated right away, although the place was packed. Their menu concept is great, tapas style, with lots of small plates to share. My favorite way to eat! We decided on trying some jamon serrano, fried brussel sprouts, feta spread, and the turkey leg confit. Everything was amazing, but there were definitely some highlights. One of my favorites were the fried brussel sprouts- the best I've ever had BY FAR! This should be the only way that brussel sprouts are prepared...OMG. SO. GOOD. Another favorite was the turkey leg cooked confit. They cook the turkey leg slowly in pork fat...now if that isn't enough to convince you to try this dish, I don't know what is...I am currently thinking of ways to cook my thanksgiving turkey this way because I just don't know if I'll ever be able to have turkey any other way. It is served with this agradolce (not sure of spelling) sauce that cuts perfectly through all of the richness of the meat. The feta spread and serrano were good as well, but just didn't compare to the brussels or turkey. I would definitely recommend going here if you are coming to Chicago, it was phenomenal! I can't wait til next time I come back and can try even more!
