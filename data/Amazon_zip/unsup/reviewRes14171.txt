Someday maybe the crowds will die down. Someday maybe Revolution will perfect its seating arrangements. So far, these are the only problems with Revolution--it's massively popular and poorly configured. Otherwise this place is fantastic. Creative beers and creative food. Not all of them good, but at least you'll keep coming back to try things.  Things that I love at Revolution: -Scoring a booth on the 2nd level for a more private meal (only happened once in the many times my husband and I have been) -Their Anti-Hero IPA (with perfect citrus and floral notes) and their Double Fist (you only really need one) -Their fish and chips with the fantastic honey jalepeno slaw -Their Working Man Burger with onions, bacon and cheddar I still think that their Cheddar Soup is really more like a cheese dip than a soup. The polenta fries are good, but there is room for some sort of improvement. The bacon fat popcorn is good, but maybe the ratio of bacon fat could be lowered just a tad to make it a little less salty. Why do they have televisions since they are almost never on? We only saw them on one day for the Northwestern football game--I went to NU and I like football, but I don't think this place really needs TVs. It's too crowded to really come and settle in to watch a game. And really it's too crowded to bring your small child or your baby in a stroller, but no one seems to be following that advice. Young couples with kids flock to revolution to cling to their former lives. In any case, I'm still a fan of Revolution despite my criticisms. I will continue to come to see and be seen, to drink and indulge.
