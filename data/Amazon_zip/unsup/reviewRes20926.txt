A friend recommended this place and I have to say, I'm incredibly impressed. Be careful, though, the portions are decently-sized. We had thought that the starters would be pretty small - nope! Anyway, the poutine was ok but nothing out of the ordinary, as was the whitefish. The clams with masala sauce were very good, especially if you got a lot of sauce on them. The standouts to me were the sweet potato soup and duck. The duck was among the best dishes I've ever had - amazing!
