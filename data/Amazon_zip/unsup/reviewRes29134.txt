I really like seafood so I ordered the Fruiti de Mare (sp?) I figured I would walk down there and eat it at home so I didn't eat there but the place was very crowded. They had my food done really quickly. I was somewhat disappointed as they did not seem to drain the Pasta very well. It was pretty tasty and a very good price for the portion. This place will always have a special place in my heart as it is the first place I went for food when I I moved to Chicago at the beginning of the month! (Sigh!) ;-)
