This place is loud and annoying on weekends, not to mention overpriced. The food is above average, but the prices are ridiculous for a sports bar of any kind. $16 for fish and chips, which included plain run of the mill fries and 5 small fish nuggets. 24 oz. beers were $8, so I fail to see the "special" there. On the bright side, kudos for the patio seating and the flat screen outside. Though the inside is cramped, at least there are 3 floors to try to accomodate the weekend crowds. People watching is fun, as you get to see the social elite rub elbows together, while the semi-attractive people try to fit in. I find myself always getting the 40 oz. of the week, so I'll let you wonder about which crowd I fit in with..
