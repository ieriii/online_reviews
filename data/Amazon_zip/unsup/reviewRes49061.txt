Boy I hope this review helps someone decide not to go to this restaurant, despite all the positive reviews here. First off, I HATE restaurants that try to be trendy for the sake of acting cool. This concept of "everything's meant to share, therefore you are not allowed to order an individual meal, and just to keep you from doing it anyway, we're going to refuse to send all the orders out at the same time" makes me want to punch people. I think there should be a warning on the web site and on the menu and on the door of the restaurant. Here, I'm going to warn you: This restaurant forces you to share a bunch of dishes with the table. Anywho...once we got past our disgust at this style of restaurant and (to the waitress' obvious horror and discontent) ordered individually (how odd of us!), we attempted to salvage our dining experience by forcing ourselves to get over it. The food came out sporadically. The ham was delicious, and I'd recommend that if you go there (and I don't recommend you even go) that you order the ham. The farm chicken was disgusting. It tastes like they dumped a bucket of Lawry's seasoning over it, and it made us ill. The bread, as mentioned, is very, very yummy. The ahi tuna has no flavor and despite the menu saying it has a pistachio crust, it does not. So...not sure why the menu lies. The beer list is outstanding. Be prepared that even though this is a "sharing restaurant," each dish is too small to be shared. You will be forced to order more than one dish per person at the table (at least two, I'd say). I can only assume they do this to rack up the bill and trick you into spending way more money than you would at the average spendy restaurant. My hope is that once the newness of this truly terribly conceived place wears off, it'll quickly go away so no one else is duped into eating here.
