Yeah, pointless to write a review of this place, I know. Seriously, I've had better hot dogs elsewhere. I'm not the sausage adventure type so I got a regular dog (after waiting eons in line of course). If you can't make a regular dog the schnizzle, I can't say I'm all that motivated to go back to try anything else. And their fries weren't even all that stellar. It seems just because it's so popular, everyone thinks they have to love it. Hm, over-rated. You have to devote a whole day to getting food from there since it takes forever to get in. Not worth the line. The hot dogs & fries at Tore's at Diversey and Western are far better.
