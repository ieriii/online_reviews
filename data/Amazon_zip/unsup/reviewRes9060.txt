I've only dined at Noon O Kabob once and I really enjoyed it. The food was delicious and service was great. There are many other cheaper mediterranean/middle eastern/persian options in Chicago that are just as good or even better, so I have not been back. I would like to go back to Noon O Kabob, but only if I want to spend over 60 bucks for two people. We ordered 2 appetizers, 2 entrees and 1 drink and the bill was almost 70 bucks. In my opinion that's too much for this place. My favs: Dill rice Caspian eggplant
