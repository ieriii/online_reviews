I'm giving Big Jones a solid 4. I wish we had sat in the front- that's my only complaint. Our table of 3 was in the back which felt like kind of an attached room with little of the same charm from the dining room. That aside, service was good, food was great. We had frog legs to start- yum, gigantic mixed green salads all around- barely dressed, but good, the corn bread they bring you is really tasty, I wanted to not to eat it but couldnt' help myself. Then I did shrimp and grits that had litlte bits of sausage in it- so rich and so good. Other dishes at the table were pork chops and a fish special. All of it was very tasty and fresh with lots of flavor. And we couldn't miss dessert- the bread pudding with a really good caramel sauce. Again, had to refrain from licking the plate.
