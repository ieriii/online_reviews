I had a very enjoyable evening with my friends here last night. After reading all these reviews, i was nervous about the parking situation- but was relieved to discover I had " front row" parking. And also after educating myself with this restaurant through these very informative reviews- i knew they might ignore us when we walked in, so being pro-active, I walked straight in to the back to announce that my party had arrived! Alison J. expressed concern over the issue of side dishes and I could confidently assure her that, yes- there will be A LOT of side dishes. Most of us ordered OB, which is very very similar to Miller Lite, but I would have to say that it went very well with the Bulkogi (18)and Beef Brisket (22). We ordered an extra miso soup (4.50) and cup of rice (2.50) There was hesitation when our meat arrived before our fire, and once again when we got our soups in the middle of our meal- but it all worked out, we got time to investigate all the side dishes, cook our meat ( which was good) and then have some of the best miso soup I've ever had. Overall for the 4 of us, we had a bill of close to 70 bucks. Our waitress was older and was actually very nice- when I asked about the lettuce we neglected to use, she showed me how I was suppose to eat it and then chatted us up about her schedule. The restaurant is open until 6am and opens at 10am and there are only 2 shifts!! If this were Check Please- I would say " I would go back".
