Amazing list full of amazing beers. Just try not to get overwhelmed and just pick one. You probably won't be disappointed. Amazing food that I'd consider well above even gastropub fare (as opposed to a bar or restaurant.) This is one awesome place to take a date. Super bonus? Parking's usually not too bad in the area. At least, I've never had a big problem finding a spot. The downside here is EVERYONE seems to love hopleaf and it's SUPER crowded and SUPER loud.
