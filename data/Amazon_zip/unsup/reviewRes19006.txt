after reading the reviews for bad apple, i have to say i'm really glad that the ones who rated it low won't be coming back...these are exactly the types of people i would loathe to drink a beer with. 'no turkey burgers' and not being able to enunciate what type of beer you enjoy or dislike? yeah, go somewhere else. as for those who love great beer, super friendly staff, awesome cheese curds and tasty burgers--keep enjoying yourselves at the bad apple like i do nearly once a week. find me and i'll buy you a tripel karmeliet!
