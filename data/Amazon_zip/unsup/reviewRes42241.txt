every time when I'm bored and crave for pho, i would make a trip to tank noodles. their pho is excellent and so is their spring rolls. i have tried 4 or 5 different pho restaurants by argyle and i must say tank noodle is the best out of all the ones Ive tried. sometimes they do a half ass job on cleaning the tables tho, cause of that tank noodle receives a 4 star...oh and their mango smoothie is very good also haha
