A place that opens up at 0600 (cracka dawn) for a manic, take-it-all in tourist like me? Gourmet, did you say? Lemme in! Walked a few blocks from my hotel, city ensconsed in fog and light dew...only signs of life were some delivery trucks roaring and the handful of fit, wiry runners headed for the Lakeshore... Determined to be the first customer in (and I was), I went straight for a box of NOLA's Cafe du Monde beignet mix ($5) and then perused their awesome selection of gourmand comestibles...lovely flatbreads, jams, cakes, meats, wines, veg, seafood... then promptly headed for the back (facing Illinois) and had a wonderful breakfast with bottomless coffee... $1.39 for bottomless joe, 3 drip brews to choose from... (aromatic and tasty), and a fresh breakfast that was sure to delight! Florentine quiche with fresh tomatoes and spinach, nice crust, with the freshest, generous cup of fruit. Quiche could have been baked about 2 mins more, and the slice could have afforded to be a bit larger. The pineapple chunks were my favorite, however...cantaloupe, mmmm.. all soft fruits. In fact, the simple fresh fruit was the favorite portion of the breakfast! And then I ordered the pecan sticky bun. Having room for only 1/3 of it, found some great to-go boxes that would be sturdy for the day ahead. Two, no three more parties soon followed within 10 minutes of me (ahh, another early bird hits the town,I see), and after reading the day's newspaper and strategically planning my blend of by foot, by "L" and by cta bus, I headed off to face my last day in this truly magnificent city. 06-24 6 days a week PS Spotted it featured on Curtis Stone's Take Home Chef s1!!!
