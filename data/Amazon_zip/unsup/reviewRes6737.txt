Don't show up starving! The place was packed on Saturday night and there was a 2 hour wait for dinner. Though we were quoted 45 minutes to an hour and fifteen minutes, we got seated after waiting about 2 hours. I attribute this partially to it being a new restaurant since it's only been open about a month. We hung out at the bar, so we didn't mind. If you want, you can eat at the bar if you don't have the patience to wait for a table. They even threw in a round of free drinks to make up for the extra long wait. I don't say this often, but it was worth it! The food was spot on. Once we got seated, the service was great. A dirty dish barely stayed on the table and the staff was extremely friendly. The orders came out prompt and perfect. This was the best meal I have eaten in Chicago. There just aren't enough adjectives to describe the food. It was outstanding. I CANNOT wait to go back! YUM!
