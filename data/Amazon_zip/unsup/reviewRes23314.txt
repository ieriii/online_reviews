So I've been coming to LSC quite frequently since my first review. I'm sure I've tried almost all their popular dishes at this point - even the host remembers my boyfriend and I. I also recently took an out of town friend here for dinner and I must say, their salt and pepper ribs are a must try. I think it's the best I've ever had. Their twice cooked pork is just so-so - I definitely would not order it again. And as I'd mentioned in my previous review, I have tried the dry chili chicken and it's become one of my regular staples at LSC. Unfortunately, the place recently burned down! I have no idea what happened but I'm praying that they fix it up soon!
