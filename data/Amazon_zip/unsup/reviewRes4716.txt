We went to the Purple Pig on the advice of New York Yelper Judy K. and I'm glad we did. I guess it could have been a little hard to find (there were other people on the street asking about it) but we noticed the purple awning. If you're coming in from Illinois Street, the trick is to go up the stairs at Michigan Street. This is not the way intersections work where I'm from, but we figured it out. Our cocktails were delicious. We were a little disappointed that many of the things we tried to order (like the deviled eggs and house cured lardo and meatball sliders) were no longer available, but, hey, we were dining pretty late so I guess that's what we get. What we did eat - Salt-Roasted Beets with Whipped Goat Cheese & Pistachio Vinaigrette, Prosciutto di San Daniele and cheese plate and, last but not least, Roasted Bone Marrow with Herbs, was all incredible.  We sat outside and when a thunderstorm hit, the manager offered to move us inside but we were pretty dry under the awning and almost done with our meal so we decided to stay put. Overall, an excellent experience. The Purple Pig lives up to the hype.
