favorite restaurant in greektown!  some of the highlights: -in the summer, there's a gorgeous and gigantic patio with a fabulous view of downtown. perfect al fresco dining! -free valet (or take the halsted bus down, it drops you off nearly right out front) -the gyros...so delicious- my fave -saganaki- opa! -and anything with feta cheese? yes. please. the downside? nothing, really.
