Wine and cheese, wine and cheese, repeat! Have you Bin 36? I rarely step foot in a wine bar, let alone step foot in a wine bar intentionally. Having attended a giant tweetup here before where I got to try different wines and cheeses, I had a little bit of nostalgia and also wanted to go to a classy place before hitting up a show at House of Blues. Malbec. It's all about the Malbecs, I love Malbecs and fortunately Bin 36 had a few I could try. My friends were late (as usual) and I passed the time zipping through my phone and enjoying the atmosphere. Watching plates of cheeses and mussels pass by along with glasses of wine and beer, I started to get hungry. When my first friend arrived we ordered a cheese plate of different cheddars which came with some sliced pear and went to town. When other friends arrived we tried some fries and mussels and more cheese, all the while taking in more beers and wines. They did have a tasty porter so I did not have to drink wine all night. There is plenty of room at Bin 36 to have a good time with a nice crowd of people.
