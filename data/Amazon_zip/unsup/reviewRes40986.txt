Albeit this is the first four dollar sign restaurant I've ever eaten at, holy crap! This was seriously the best meal of my life. All of the food was unbelievably fantastic. I'm a self-professed picky eater, often made fun of by friends and acquaintances for my dislike some things strange, some things pretty ordinary. I decided that for this meal, all bets were off. I had probably four personal "firsts," including fois gras and raw oysters. I'm so glad I did! Incredible! I'm currently revising my life goals to include making enough money so I can come here on a weekly basis.
