Great little gem of a place. Smaller menu but that is to be expected at a smaller local place - plus a small menu usually means what you order will be spot on and Big Jones did not disappoint. To start I tried the Split Pea soup which was delicous, though I don't think it rated the $9 price tag. The Crawfish Fritters were perfectly crispy on the outside and crawfish deliciousness on the inside - serviced with a spicy drizzle of sauce that was just right. The entrees we tried were the Shrimp & Grits, Migas, and the crab cake eggs benedict - each was simply perfect. The two egg dishes came with some delightful hash browns, seasoned and cooked perfectly. Loved the decor, very comfortable and cozy but elegant. Great for dates! They have a large selection of teas and a few choice beer selections. The service was just okay. We were the first patrons of the day and our server was just a bit off, which is the only reason I am sparing them the fifth star.
