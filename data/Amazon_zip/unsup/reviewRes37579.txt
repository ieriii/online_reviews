Can I love a grocery store? Can I live in a grocery store? Cause I love this place!! If you are looking for a high end foodie heaven grocery store this is it! You won't find cheap stuff here, only quality and stuff that costs an arm and a leg. IF you are into fine dining and a nice selection of organic/healthy/hard to find foods and wine then come here! they also have a neat restaurant and a massive cafeteria where you can get some yummy grub in a hurry.
