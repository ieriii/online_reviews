This place is solid. It's better than a 3, and maybe not quite a 4, but it is good. The burgers here are quite diverse and interesting - much like the crowd that frequents the place. I have long been a burger guy, and in the past five years, it has been nice to see the burger put on a higher pedestal than where it had been sitting previously. But at what point does it go too far?  The bad apple does everything right. The food, service, and atmosphere is top notch. The only issue that I have is the price. I understand the idea that quality costs more. I really do. But a menu full of $11 burgers and $6 beers seems more like something you would find in Manhattan than in a northside Chicago neighborhood. I once asked the bartender if they had any specials, and received the cheesy, pre-meditated reply of, "everything's a special". Well, that sounds great, but in this economy, offering a mid-week special might actually help you draw a few people who like beer, but like to be able to have more than one. But since then, I believe the prices have come down slightly...not sure.
