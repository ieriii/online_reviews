this is really good pizza. they all kinds of toppings, tell me if YOUVE ever tried clam or mashed potatoes on ur pizza. funny thing is, the server wanted us to try the mashed potatoes so badly...and after talking about it w friends after, i hear the clam is really good too. anyway the pizza comes in a mishaped rectangle which is funny. the crust is so crisp and good, and its not smothered in sauce, it has a light amount but very flavorful. we ended up having a standard type of pizza, but it had over the top taste. they also brew their own drafts here which is cool, and the place has good design and a chill vibe.
