I truly hope that I can give a more accurate review of this place at a later date. I called the reservations line and an automated advertisement basically picked up the call and I stayed on hold for like 10 min. When a lady finally picked up I explained that I had made a reservation for my parents (for my wedding) on hotwire and that my fiance and I decided we would like to stay there too (and that we were getting married on Sept 12). I asked if she could give us the same rate as hotwire. She just said no, we can't do that. No, let me see what I can offer you. Hey - you sell your rooms to hotwire so don't get upset with me for booking with them at a cheaper rate. It just really bothers me when a hotel has a 4, 4 1/2 or 5 star rating and I have a bad experience from the moment I call. It's not what I would expect. Especially when it's a special occasion like my wedding. I bet if I would have called the Ritz Carlton they would have done it.
