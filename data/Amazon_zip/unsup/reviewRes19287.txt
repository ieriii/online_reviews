Late night drinks and appetizers after the ballet in early February. We were quickly seated and drinks were ordered, Very good beer and wine by the glass selection. We ordered a cheese plate, the house burger with all the toppings and an order of chips. It was all very good, We loved the places atmosphere and will come back and try a full dinner. The one star deduct was for dust We were seated at the booth just past the bar on the right, and as I looked down the bar out towards Mich Ave I could see the side and back of the flat screen that hung over the corner of the bar. The back of the TV and the wires leading to it had a thick coat of built up dust, sorry, not very attractive.
