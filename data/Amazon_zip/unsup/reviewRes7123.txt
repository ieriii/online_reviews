Good barbecue is not difficult to find in Chicago. Great barbecue, however, is another story entirely. Chicago Q meets the "great" mark and then some. For those that are familiar with the prior establishment at this location, Tsunami, you will be shocked by the interior overhaul. A warm, contemporary rustic farmhouse vibe has replaced the once drab and dreary interior of the former establishment, and complements the barbecue experience. I ordered the St. Louis half slab of ribs with a side of cornbread. Q also offers "competition style" ribs which are reportedly out of this world, but you have to get there early as a limited supply is made each day. The regular St. Louis ribs were amazing, and fall-off-the-bone delicious. There are some seasonings on the meat, but the actual barbecue sauce is served on the side and includes 3 tasty options including a vinegar-based sauce, traditional, and spicy. The ribs can stand perfectly fine by themselves, but the BBQ sauce adds the extra variety. I've been to several rib joints where the meat is fatty and has the membrane near the bone. None of this is true of the amazing ribs at Q as they clearly take pride in selecting the best meat possible. The cornbread was among some of the best I've had, and includes a pad of some sort of sweet butter which makes it that much more delectable. Our servers were friendly and accommodating. Food took a little while to come out, but it is absolutely worth it and expected considering the restaurant soft-opened this week. I will absolutely be returning to Q, hopefully to sample some of the competition style ribs!
