I was hear 5 years ago with my husband (then boyfriend). For us, this was a once in a lifetime meal, and they didn't miss a beat. I remember being treated like a queen and not one bump along the way. I think we chose the 10-course offering and also got a cheese plate at the end of the meal. When we were on our way out we were also given a little loaf of lemon bread for breakfast the next morning. Of all the places we have traveled to and eaten out at this is one of the most memorable of all!
