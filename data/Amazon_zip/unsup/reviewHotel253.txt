I loved it. The staff was friendly and helpful. One of the highlights is the pool on the roof. Great view of the Sears (willis) tower. Restaurant in the lobby sucks so stay away. Not a 4 star hotel but I came for work and the 179 a night was the cheapest in the area and it was very nice for that price
