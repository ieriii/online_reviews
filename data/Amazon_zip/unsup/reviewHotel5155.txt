We had a room reservation for New Years Eve and asked for an upgraded corner balcony with a view of Navy Pier at check-in, and Jamie was very nice and helped us out with our request, and mentioned you'll like the room. We did; and appreciated his efforts.Hotel is brand new, and everything was very nice and clean. The staff was all very friendly and we highly recommend the hotel. We'll be back soon.
