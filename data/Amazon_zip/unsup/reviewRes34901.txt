I learned something from Sushi X this weekend: Don't judge a sushi joint by it's cover. (or store front, mind you.) With it's dark front faade, lack of windows and techno music thumping does give a S&M "Leather Daddy", vampire bar vibe, however, quickly after walking in it feels like an underground, moody lounge. Since Butterfly Sushi couldn't squeeze our party of 9 -- oh yes it's ladies night -- we were on a hunt for another BYOB/Sushi place near the Wicker Park hood. I'm glad we went to Sushi X. It's intimate, funky, delicious and very reasonably priced. Two rolls that you have to try are the Spicy Scallop and Crab Rangoon (it's served with plum sauce for dipping...ahhh delicious.)
