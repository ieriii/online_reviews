I know the chicago diner is beloved by vegetarians and while the food was decent, I can't say I was wowed. Chicago Diner is always busy but I have never had to deal with much of a wait to get seated. Inside is cramped and flat out grimy. The wait staff (for the males at least) were very much hipsters all with some form of a knit cap. Service is decent, orders are promptly taken and the food comes out timely. Although when waiting for your food, its hard not to look around in the nooks and corners and wonder when the last time its been scrubbed clean. Foodwise, I have always stuck with the mexican style dishes, which unless you told me, I might not have noticed that wasn't real meat. But I can't confuse that statement with saying the food wow'ed me, it didn't. I will say their beer lineup is pretty solid and 5 Rabbits brewery has always pared well with my meal. I'll still go back and have an enjoyable meal but its far from the top of my list; vegetarian or not.
