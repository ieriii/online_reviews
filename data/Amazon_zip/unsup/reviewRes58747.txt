Hi this my first ever yelp! Okay I was really exited about going to Graham Elliot's and I was a little disappointed based on the other reviews. I thought I was in for the time of my life and it was - eh. The white truffle popcorn is good, but not a "first time ever creation". I've had this a few times - it's also called Parmesan & Garlic popcorn. I also had the risotto with the cheezits and it wasn't creamy based as I would have liked, it ran a little on the thick side. For this kind of meal I would not expect to pay $80.00 a person. Good: I did have the scallops which were tasty. Also they do have a nice variety of beverage parings. I thought the portions were fine.
