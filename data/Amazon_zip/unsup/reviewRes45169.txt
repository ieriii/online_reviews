I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this restaurant. I think that this is the best restaurant in Andersonville. Doug the manager, is super nice. The food is great- classic Italian simplicity but with excellent flavors. Whomever said the portion sizes are too small, is crazy. It is simply sized to have enjoyed an appetizer first. I will say that the desserts leave a little bit to be desired, but I am also super critical on dessert.  You can't go wrong choosing the restaurant. Make sure you try for the patio in the summer- it's awesome.
