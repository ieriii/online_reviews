This is my absolute favorite neighborhood restaurant, bar none. I have been going for years now; their quality, presentation, and pleasant demeanor keep me coming back. Both the Thai and the sushi are excellent (the teriyaki can be a bit tough sometimes) and they have more than a few unique dishes that really take things to the next level. Their presentations are impeccable and worthy of a restaurant twice its price. Dishes I love include the smoked chili combo, the gyoza (and especially its sauce), their salad dressings, the spicy tuna roll, and some of their custom far-out rolls like Bangkok. It saddens me that I can no longer go here due to dietary restrictions. I will treasure the memory of many wonderful long lunches and delivered dinners from this gem. If you're in the neighborhood, please give it a try - and see how fast you return.
