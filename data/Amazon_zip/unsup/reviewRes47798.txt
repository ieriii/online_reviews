As a fan of Brazilan steakhouses I was not sure what to expect. That is not quite what Zeds is but its close. My wife and I arrived after having to move our reservations. We were asked to wait in the bar while our table was readied. The bar scene is happeing great decor lots of wood and cool chairs and benches. It would be a great place to hangout for a happy hour. There is a huge projection screen showing the olympics that was cool. The food was very good. The salad bar, while not quite as extensive as other places had some very tasty selections. The meat was well seasoned and arriving at a frantic pace if you leave you stone on the table. All you can eat meat and slad at a reasonable price. Great atmosphere, and a roof top deck. I'll be back.
