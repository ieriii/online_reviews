Piece is just OK. I give it two stars because the brewery selection is pretty good...Golden Arm is a solid choice. It does have a good selection of sauces and toppings, I suppose, and the pizzas are massive, but it's nothing to write home about. I'm starting to really dig Chicago-style pizza, so maybe that's it; Piece is just regular pizza. It reminds me of Mellow Mushroom but without the awesome parmesan crust. Oh, and the caprese salad, which is one of my favorite things on earth and is pretty difficult to screw up, was weak. The mozzarella, CLEARLY not buffalo mozzerella, was sliced into thick rectangles and there was little, if any, balsamic vinegar. Not tasty. I may venture back if an event draws me there, but I won't go there if I'm craving great pizza.
