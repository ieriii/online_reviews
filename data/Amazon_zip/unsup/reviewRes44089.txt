If you go here and have a bad time or are with a real jack arse you can always take em out with the cast iron tea cups... This is my new local sushi place and I love it. My favorite is the dragon roll since I am a huge fan of eel and avocados.  They have a large assortment of maki rolls in addition to my favorite dragon and all are interesting and sapid. If you don't like sushi but still want to go they have a full bar and are also BYOB - double fun... Other reasons why they get five stars aside from their sweet location down from my place are as follows: cloth napkins nice ambiance reasonable prices good lighting friendly staff - quick too *Oh I forgot about the tea cups! So yeah if you order tea it comes out in the heaviest cup ever made from cast iron. The sucker weighs a ton. The lil kette it comes out in is also cast iron. So again, if you are with a terrible date or an annoying friend and want to liven it up just throw either the cup or the kettle at their dome and make it a fun night. Either that or just steal a marble rye from a random 'old bag' as you walk home down Broadway....yeah I watch Seinfeld too much. I like this place alot - you should too...
