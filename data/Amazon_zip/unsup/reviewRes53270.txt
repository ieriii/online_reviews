It's Saturday evening, six 20-somethings need nourishment before a grueling night of Art on Track, a gallery after party, assorted bar hopping, and dancing their asses off for the bittersweet shutting down celebration at Bonnie's. The night had to start somewhere, and Sultan's was an ideal launching point. For less than $8 you can get a full dinner. I opted for the lamb shawarma over curry rice, with a side of hummus, pita, and Jerusalem salad. As noted in other reviews, some of the lamb pieces were overcooked and dry, but the majority of it was fine. The rice, hummus, and salad were all delicious, especially the salad. Best of all the BYOB policy works well with the large seating area and overall chill vibe. Next time, I'll have a more standard falafel sandwich. Pro Tip: No need to lug wine. There's a great wine and beer (including my current favorite, Crabbie's alcoholic ginger beer) selection at a shop conveniently located across the street.
