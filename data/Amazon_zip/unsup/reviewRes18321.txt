After a 10:00 breakfast at Hooiser Mama and an 11:30 lunch at Topolobampo, Michael K. and I had no business stopping in XOCO for an extra dessert. We did it anyway. Obviously. It was a short visit, so this will be a short review. We just wanted a little taste of XOCO as long as we were on the Rick Bayless block, having checked out and checked off the more expensive restaurants. We shared a single churro with sides of hot chocolate sauce and Mexican vanilla soft serve. The churro came a la carte and the sides were probably more expensive than they should have been. No matter. That was an awesome churro. It looked kind of pale, but one bite revealed it was fried to golden perfection, with a crunchy crust leading into chewy dough insides. Not too sugary, but definitely sweet, it went well with the dark hot chocolate sauce, which was decidedly unsweetened. This was lush, rich chocolate, with a slow viscosity and a thick, smooth texture. If I were hungrier, I would have eaten it with a spoon. The Mexican vanilla soft serve was also great, though less suited to the churros. It had a nice creamy texture and a pure vanilla bean flavor that made it more interesting than your proverbial vanilla. Next time I'm in Chicago, I will come back to try the tortas and caldos, which looked so wickedly tempting even to our food-clogged eyes. I gave a lot of money to Sr. Bayless on this trip, but XOCO's churro was one of the best things he fed me, at the most affordable price.
