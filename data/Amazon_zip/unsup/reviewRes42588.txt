I went here with my co-assistant-in-crime (read: boss's wife's assistant) to exchange gifts and gab over cocktails and my goodness, what a lovely place! I liked the chic interior and our server was both knowledgeable and attentive. We went early - before the full menu opened up (5:45pm), but no matter; we indulged ourselves on some crafty cocktails and relaxed, casting occasional snoopy glances into the open kitchen. It is quite dark in here. You will need the tea light at your table to read the menu unless you've just come from the optometrist and have wildly dialated pupils. Just sayin. A great place to come for a great drink. We will be back.
