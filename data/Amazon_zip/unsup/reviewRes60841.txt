Ohh ZED...how I love you. This is probably one of my favorite restaurants in the city and every time we go back, it just gets better. They frequently change their offerings (as well as their cocktail menu...kumquat mule, anybody?!) and I always leave full and very satisfied. Services is always top-notch, as is the food, and the sauces they serve with the meat/fish offerings...you must try them. I also don't think ZED gets enough credit for their brunch - Orange is right across the street and I'm telling you, for a great price ($24/person) skip the line and head over to ZED. You get a GREAT brunch complete with large skillets of cinnamon rolls, and tons of other great eats.I recently also tried the butterscotch bread pudding dessert...holy yum. I love this place. If you haven't been, you must try it!
