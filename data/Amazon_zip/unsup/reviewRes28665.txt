The Pasta Bowl serves up some great pasta in a bar atmosphere. Started off with Tuffo Saporito, which was goat cheese, marinara sauce, bread for dipping, and a spoon for eating the leftover cheese and sauce. It definitely hit the spot after I had spent some time playing Deer Hunter in the bar area before dinner. For the entree I had Farfalle Pollo, which was bowtie pasta, chicken, and mushrooms in a red cream sauce. It had lots of flavor and I was especially impressed with the mushrooms. The portion was large and I took some home to eat for breakfast the next morning. The service was good and I will be going back or getting delivery.
