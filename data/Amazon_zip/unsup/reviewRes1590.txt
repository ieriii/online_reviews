There's a reason why people will wait in line for an hour in the rain/snow to eat at Hot Dougs. This place is the Mecca of hot dog joints. Where to begin?  Doug greets every single one of his customers at the front counter. He clearly understands that his customers willingly sacrifice their time and patience to eat at his restaurant and he shows his appreciation to each and every one of his customers. The wait staff is also very cheerful. The atmosphere is fun and inviting. It was almost like being inside of a comic book with hot dog themed pictures and art deco on the wall. Despite the long line, there was plenty of room to sit and the place never felt crowded. 80s music plays while you dine and it helps to enhance the fun atmosphere. This isn't just another Chicago dog place. At Hot Dougs, you are privy to a weekly list of specialty encased meats that include anything from ostrich, rattlesnake, and fois gras. I ordered the Pineapple and Jalapeno Pork Sausage and split an Atomic Bomb Sausage with my brother. Both were memorable. The taste is good enough to justify spending almost 10 dollars on a hot dog. Some people might be turned away by the wait, the short hours of operation, and the cash only rule. What they need to understand is that Doug delivers in terms of taste and quality on every single facet of his business and that's what entitles him to set these rules. If you're traveling from out of town, I would put Hot Dougs high on the priority list. If you live in the Chicagoland area and haven't visited yet, you owe it to yourself to come here.
