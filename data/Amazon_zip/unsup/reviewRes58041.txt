I placed my order on LivingSocial using a voucher and moments later, I received an e-mail that told me that my food would be ready in 17 minutes. 10 minutes later, my friend decides to order from the same restaurant using the same LivingSocial voucher. After he orders his food, we wait another 20 minutes before going to the restaurant to pick it up. That's a good thirty minutes and both of our orders should be ready. When we get there, none of the waiters/waitresses approached us to serve us. So we decide to go to the counter and tell them we are here for a pick up. They say okay, turn around and forget about us. So we say it again and the people at the counter are so clueless as to what we are doing and we get ignored again. Then a third time, we tell them we are here for a pickup and they finally ask us what we ordered. We tell them that we ordered on LivingSocial and they finally have an OHHH moment. They look through their orders and find my friend's and he receives his food, but I am still waiting for mine. So we ask them how long it will take for mine and the waiter does not reply. We wait another 5 minutes and ask another waiter and this waiter tells us 5 minutes. Another 5 minutes pass and we ask another waiter and he tells us it is coming. We wait a little longer and as we wait, one of the waiters cough into his hands, does no wash his hands and serves a table. Finally, our food comes and the waiter hands it to us with a very sour look on his face. Horrible.
