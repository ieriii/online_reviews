Ahhhh...Piece. My favorite pizza in Chicago. Seems sacrilegious in a town famous for its deep dish, but Piece certainly brings something new (and delicious) to the table. Having grown up on the East Coast, I'm a fan of both thin crust and New Haven Style Pizza, and Piece has both down to a science. Add a specialty craft beer list, tons of seating, and live band Karaoke on Saturday nights, and you have one of my favorite spots in Chicago.
