I love this place! I know, another Lettuce Entertain You restaurant, but this one is the best! The Oyster Bar great-it's not pretentious or snooty and I can always get a table, even when it's busy. As at all LEYE restaurants the service is impeccable. The seared tuna is to die for and the scallops never fail me. They pour a stiff drink and never rush you out. I just can't stay away! My only complaint is that they close too early.
