As many times as I've been here I cannot believe I have not reviewed 90 Miles! Simply put, I love this place! Everyone I take with me falls in love with it! I always get the croquetas and the mariquitas MMM! I got the Ropa Viega sandwich which I thought was going to be small, um no I was so full, and it was amazing!! My cousin got the chicken, with rice and beans and she was so into her food we didn't hear from her much. Since its BYOB, we took our red wine and had some yummy sangria in the outside patio. Service was kind of slow, I really thought they had forgotten about us is my only gripe. 90 Miles: how I love you! go and try it, and don't forget your wine!
