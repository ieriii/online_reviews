Standing in line for 30 minutes for a sandwich is something I don't do too often, and I really wanted to love Xoco, my first venture into the Bayless empire. Well, it's no one's fault but my own that I didn't especially care for the torta I ordered. Perhaps it was the flavor palate (a little acidic) that wasn't my thing, but I will say the hot chocolate is a force to be reckoned with, and if they had one line for meals and one line for drinks and pre-made sweets, maybe I'd brave Xoco once more for a cup of cocoa, but standing in line for half an hour should only happen when the drink is so good you want to renounce all others of its kind, and I'm not there yet, Xoco.
