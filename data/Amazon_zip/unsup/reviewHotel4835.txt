I stay here - whenever I can. I do have membership to both starwood (sheraton) and hyatt (passport). Excellent point systems in both hotels, but good sheratons (with a view) at reasonable corporate prices are rare to find in Chicago downtown. So, that leaves me with this Hyatt - and this one is really nice. Marriott's and Hiltons and Holiday Inn's take for ever to build up points to get a free night, so I tend to avoid them if I can.I always enjoy staying in this hotel. Rooms are fantastic and being a platinum member, I always get great views - 20th floor and higher.I go here for the views, room decor, great bathroom (towels seem cheap tho), and quietness in the rooms. Most rooms have large LCD screen TVs (with horrible resolution:) ), hotel has good service and "that" BIG BAR.Tip: There is a dominicks (safeway grocery store) across the river where you can get great wine, fresh fruits and juices if you are planning on staying for over 2-3days. Internet is extra 13+/night, and a mini fridge is 25/stay.
