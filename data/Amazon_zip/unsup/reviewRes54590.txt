I have been going to Sultan's for years. The food is great and really affordable! However, I may be wrong but I feel like certain dishes have a bit less of a kick than they used to. I was slightly dissapointed by the soup and the tabouli salad when I had them last some months ago. Not enough spice I thought - it had been a couple years since I had tried them. However, everything else still rocks and the salad bar is a great deal! Everything on the bar is really fresh and delicious. You can fill a container with all sorts of goodies and pay very little for variety that would be expensive to make at home. Great food. Great prices.
