This place is stellar for a spicy meal in the dead of winter. Brought a couple of Bells Winter White Ale, probably the best seasonal beer to go with spicy food. It is BYOB but they will charge you 10 bucks for corkage.  The service was way better than the last time we were here, about a year or so ago. We usually get the hotpot but this time we wanted to revisit the classic Szechuan dishes on the menu. We got the Ma Po tofu (must have) dry chili chicken and tong cai, my favorite Asian green, which was stirfried with garlic. The Ma Po tofu is easily the best version of this dish in all of Chicago, It's fiery red, not at all like the bland brown looking dish that you would get at other Chinese restaurants that don't specialize in Szechuan cuisine (and better than Double Li's the other Szechuan place nearby). The dry chili chicken was a great contrast to the saucy and silky smooth Ma Po tofu. The chicken was crispy, full of spice and included nice big pieces of garlic, ginger and green onion. The tong cai served as a respite from the heat of the other two dishes and was perfectly crisp. The more we ate the spicier dishes, the more accustomed we got to the heat and we slowly began tasting the full spectrum of the flavors in the two preparations. But please let us be clear - these dishes are for those who can handle the spice. Needless to say, the beers served their function admirably, although if you don't bring your own, Tsingtao draft will do the job just as well. It was a feast that I hope to repeat on any future winter night.. Without the corkage fee the total was about 40 bucks.. not bad at all.
