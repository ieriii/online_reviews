For the amount of money we paid, this was a great hotel. The hotel is located only a couple of blocks from Navy Pier and the Magnificent Mile. Our suite had a queen size bed in the bedroom, as well as a convertable sofa in the living room. The living room also had a flat-screen tv. While all of these amenities were nice, in my opininon, the hotel's best feature is the complimentary manager's reception from 5:30 to 7:30 each night. For two hours, they offer their guests free well drinks and free domestic draft beer, as well as free chips and salsa to snack on. Needless to say, we took full advantage of the hotel's generosity during our three night stay. Depending on what night of the week you are there, there may be a bit of a line for the drinks. This was the case on a Saturday evening. We quickly learned that the best way to deal with this was to get our drinks and then get back in line. By the time we finished our drinks, we were at the front of the line and could order more. The hotel also offers a complimentary breakfast from 6:30 to 9:30 on weekdays and from 7:00 to 10:30 on weekends. We never woke up in time to make it to breakfast, but apparently they offer made to order omelettes. Ironically, I think our taking advantage of the complimentary evening reception may have in part contributed to our inability to make it to the complimentary breakfast.
