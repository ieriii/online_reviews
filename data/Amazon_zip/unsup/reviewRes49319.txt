Bin 36 was my first experience with one of those fancy River North restaurants I would just glance at from outside its windows when walking by, thinking I couldn't afford nor appreciate to eat at a place like this because I am not a sommelier. But it doesn't matter whether one knows wine or not, for the lunches here are under $25! And at the end of it, you get a free cookie (mind you, GOOD, chocolate chip cookie) and water bottle on your way out of the door! I've been here three times and each time I want the same thing: the chicken salad sandwich on ciabatta bread. (Okay, the sandwich probably has a different name but thanks to Bin 36, their website is down and I can't tell you what it's really called). The sandwich also comes with a side of sweet potato fries or a very good salad with a bittersweet taste. I think the salad had arugala dressed with raspberry vinagrette. I am always pleased with my choice and leave the restaurant feeling satisfied. It also tends not to be busy during the lunch hour, so I tend to bring friends who I haven't seen in awhile here for good food and conversation. I was also pleased with how they handled my reservation for a lunch date I had, seating the two of us in the white tablecloth portion of the restaurant by the windows. It gave the two of us an appropriate first (and LAST) date. Cheers to the food and not the lunchtime company (who at least paid for my meal)!
