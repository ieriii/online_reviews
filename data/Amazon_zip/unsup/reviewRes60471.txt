I would give this place zero stars.My husband and i heard the Mac n cheese was really good so we decided to try it.We never found out because of the rude "hostess".We came in at 9:15pm and it was not too busy and there were plenty of available tables. As soon as we walked in the hostess looked us up and down and barked that MAYBE if a reservation cancelled, we could have a table. We should wait at the bar.There were at least 15 tables open and we did not want to wait at the bar. We walked out immediately and they just looked at us confused.I am disgusted by their rude and unfriendly behavior.Life is too short to waste money in establishments that do not appreciate and value the customer.TERRIBLE SERVICE
