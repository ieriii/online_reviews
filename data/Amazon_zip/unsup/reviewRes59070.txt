I love Yolk. Love it. It only gets three stars because of location and the service due to the location.This location just isn't my favorite. Since this location is on Michigan Ave., it attracts more tourists than I would like to encounter during my breakfast/brunch hour. and because its so packed and busy, the servers look a bit frazzled trying to get everything out and done right. Be patient when you venture to this locale.If you go to this location, be prepared to wait for a table, especially if you have a large party. I was with a group of seven people and we waited about 45 minutes to an hour.By the time we were seated I was starving, which was good, because the food is dabombdotcom.Portions are large, I would suggest sharing except they charge you two extra bucks to share. Might as well order a dish and split between those in your party. You won't regret it. You'll be trying everything and its all good.I had the iron man omelet with pancakes and hash browns while trying everybody else's dishes at my table. Good thing it was family, I think some of my friends wouldn't be so willing to share! The food is that good. I also tried the waffles, the cinnamon french toast and a crepe of some sort. All delicious. You'll be good and full that you will have enough energy to see all of the Chicago sights.Go to yolk! You won't be disappointed!
