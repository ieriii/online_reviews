Like the majority of the others have said, this place makes some really great pizza. I prefer their stuffed pizza over the thin crust. It's so good, I sometimes get a slice to go with my sub. Speaking of subs, they have subs! Yes they have great pizza but they make a pretty good sub sandwich, too. Forget Subway's $5 foot longs. Come here and get a $5 foot long that has meat and tastes much better (ha, take that Subway). Two can share a sub for lunch for $2.50 a person. What a lunch deal. My past co-workers consistently skipped ordering the pizza and went straight for the subs. And the guy with the glasses that usually works behind the counter is awesome. Nice and friendly. Even hooked me up with a free slice of pizza. Glad to see they expanded the place because sometimes I felt like a sardine in a can waiting for my order. Now if they could only expand the parking lot. During the evening rush hour, it can be a pain in the ass to make a left turn outta there!
