Best french fries and sausages in Chicago. Go on the weekend for duck fat fries, they are a life changing experience. Get there early or wait in line (totally worth it). The different hot dog's have fun names and the place is filled with funny commentary on the history of encased meat. You must go here if you are in Chicago. The only downside to this place is that it is cash only.
