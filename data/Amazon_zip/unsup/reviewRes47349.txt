Just checked out this place last week for the Monday night special, 1/2 price burgers! It was pretty dead inside which i was surprised about because my friend had warned me that the place was usually packed. Our server was awesome. Very attentive and nice!  My friend and I split two burgers, the "Possession of 'Shrooms" and the "Electric Chair." The burgers were delicious. Big, cooked perfectly and served with seasoned fries. The fries also came with a chipotle mayo dipping sauce that was amazing!! They had a good selection on tap and $1.75 PBR cans on Mondays for their special.  I will be sure to visit here again for another yummy burger!
