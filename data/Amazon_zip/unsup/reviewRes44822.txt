Stuffed pizza. 1 slice = joy! 2 slices = still yum. 3rd slice when trying to finish off a pie w/1 buddy = pain. Honestly haven't had enough stuffed pizza to cast too much judgment, but it was good enough to me. What I didn't appreciate so much was waiting an hour to get my pizza. Granted, I went there during the least busy shift of the day (4p) where everyone is on their coffee/smoke breaks, but still, 1 hour after ordering? I know stuffed pizza takes longer to cook, but.... Oh well, I'm more of a thin crust guy anyway; will have to try theirs at a later date.
