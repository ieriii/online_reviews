My sister and I took our older sister here for a birthday dinner. I was aiming for a semi-trendy/hip environment where we could dress up and have a great meal. For the most part, Carnivale delivered. I was a little surprised to see people there who were dressed down... I was also let down by the host situation. After standing in front of the host desk for a few minutes while the hostess ignored me, I finally was able to let them know we were there for our 7pm reservation. She said fine, go wait by the door to be seated. Ok...so we waited by the door for 10-15 minutes, while they ushered other parties in and didn't acknowledge us. Hm. So then I went back and asked the hostess if we had time to have a drink, since apparently it was going to be a bit of a wait. She said "Oh, sorry, yeah" but by that time they were ready to seat us. It would have been nice if they had told us to feel free to grab a drink at the bar, instead of sending us over to the doorway to wait. I was really disappointed in their hostess and in that aspect of the night. The rest of the night was great. All the food and drinks were delicious...my sister complained about her mojito lacking in alcohol but maybe she is just a lush. Jk. I recommend the chips and guac, ceviche, skirt steak, chicken, and ahi tuna. All the desserts were delicious. Same with the coffee/Kahlua drink my sister had. Mmm. So four stars because for the most part the experience lived up to my expectations , our waitress was phenomenal, and I liked the atmosphere. But seriously - their hosting situation pissed me off and I hope it was a one-time fluke.
