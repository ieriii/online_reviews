Oh my my my, Hopleaf! What big "mussels" you have! Oh, hopleaf, how you complete me! You're savory dishes, lively patrons, and belgium beers fill my soul!  [cough cough] - oh geez, sorry, I got carried away by the fantastic-ness of this place located in the Andersonville area. Hopleaf bar is truly a gem of the northside. They are one of the few bars in the city (and in the Midwest) that carry all still functioning Belgium Trappist beers in the world. And their beer list is HUGE and they have over 20 taps to choose everyday for great prices! Beers cost between $5 and $8 (on tap) depending on style and make. It's not super cheap, but it's in the "affordable" range for a HIGH quality brew from somewhere in the world. Let me tell you about the food. You MUST have the mussels and fries. For just $12, you get about 14 mussels, big piece of fresh bread, and a whopping larger cone of Belgium fries. Quite frankly, this is an amazing deal and prolly the best mussel deal in the city. This is more than enough for 1 person dinner or lunch. I like to eat all of the mussels with the bread and then drink the sauce like a soup simply because it is THAT good. Trust me on this, do the mussels. Great bargain for great quality. The other food on the menu consists of sandwiches and entrees which are a bit on the high-end price, although I've heard that they are nothing short of amazing. I'd avoid coming here on the weekends with a group (if you must on a weekend, only bring a max of two other people or be prepared to wait for way over an hour for a table). Come on a weekday and it's much easier to sit and find a nice table. Enjoy my friends! Cheers!
