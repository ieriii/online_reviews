The last time I was here, I think the girl behind the counter helping me was super stoned, or just really spacey (hence slowish service), but whatever, she was nice and the focaccia I had was good. And don't even get me started on the red velvet cupcake. Mmmm...delectible. The lounge is next door and you have to go outside to access it, which, for some reason, I think is kinda funny and I like it.
