Two of the most delicious words in the culinary world--butter & cake. With so many steakhouses in Chicago this place is definitely on the trendy/pricey side. While I enjoyed all the typical steakhouse fare---filet was perfectly seasoned, sides were notable, the best thing about this place is the BUTTER CAKE. I won't be returning for dinner (delicious, but steakhouses aren't my gig), however, I will be returning for the butter cake and a martini.
