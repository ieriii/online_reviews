I ate at "the Oyster Bar", the casual part of the restaurant; there, there is no need to dress up, there are kids there, and there is sometimes live music. The atmosphere was great, and the food was good. I am not sure if the crab legs were worth $50 (it was pretty dry). The service was a bit slow, but everything else was fine.
