If you're looking for a place to see and be seen in an up and coming area, this is it. However if your looking for a great place to have a good lunch over conversation with friends, forget it. I visited Mike & Honey a few weeks ago for Sunday brunch and was rather disappointed.  The wait was quite long and the food was only passable.  I had the Tomato, Mozzerella & Basil sandwich and felt that I could have made a better one at home in five minutes. Even the others at my table had rather lackluster feelings on their food. What was really bad was the level of sound in the place. Conversation was almost impossible. They really, really should throw up some sound dampening somewhere, even if it's artistic...there are companies that specialize in that sort of thing after all. So yes, there were beautiful, trendy people streaming in and out, but the rest was "meh" at best. - Andrew
