Rooms are VERY SMALL! Not a criticism, just a fact. Our room was approximately 10 X 12 with a view of a brick wall about 3 feet from the window. However: great price for the great location, wonderful bed, big screen TV, free WiFi, AC, breakfast included. Terrific staff. If you just need a comfortable, clean place to sleep and shower this works great.
