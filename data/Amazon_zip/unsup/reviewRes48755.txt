Great surprise! We were looking for a different restaurant and ended up there.Bit concerned in the beginning, specially after seeing the pigs paintings on the walls.Weird.But funny. By the place you would never say how good the food and service are. Great list of beers, great appetizers, very nice staff.I became a fan! Check out the restrooms too.It worth a visit. :)
