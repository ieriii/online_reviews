Hands down the BEST pizza in Chicago.... I am not even a fan of deep dish pizza, but it is absolutely divine. I am happy with canadian bacon (need a little bit of meat in my life!) with fresh spinach and extra garlic. YUM. Even though I am a total fat kid with eating the pizza, I have to also have the Pequod's salad w/ their vinagrette dressing on the side. If you aren't up in Lincoln Park/Lakeview area... it is a haul from downtown, but worth it. Don't do those other places that might be mentioned in your tourist guide. Trust me! I found this place a year after I had lived in Chicago after I had sworn off deep dish pizza. My favorite meal in Chicago. I know... I am high maintence. : ) UPDATE: I converted 2 more of my co-workers to Pequod's....heehee... its like pizza crack.
