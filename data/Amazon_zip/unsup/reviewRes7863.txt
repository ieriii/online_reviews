Heard mixed reviews, but I really enjoyed Spacca Napoli! Went with a friend and we split a salad, pizza, and dessert and really felt everything was fresh and tasty. Insalata Mista - usually basic but this one was especially good. Pizza Diavola - w/spicy salami and buffalo mozzarella - on the waitress's recommendation.  NUTELLA stuffed pastry for dessert - was probably enough for at least 4 people but just the 2 of us couldn't let it go to waste. Atmosphere - seemed to be a lot of small friend groups and young families. Nice outdoor patio.
