East coast-style chowder house in friendly Chicago neighborhood. We thoroughly enjoyed the seafood fare - with an extensive chalkboard menu of all the fresh "catches of the day" The clam chowder is thick and clams meaty. Our only complaint was that it could have been served a little hotter. For main course, we tried the "world's best shrimp cocktail"' which really should have been titled the "world's biggest shrimp," period. On the next trip, we might skip the ridiculously oversized shrimp and instead try out one of the myriad fish specials.
