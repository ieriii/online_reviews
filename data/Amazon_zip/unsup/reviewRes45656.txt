This place is a toss up for me. As a proud resident of the area, I want to see my community flourish and see new businesses grow and blossom. I think the setting is beautiful and I find to food to be quite tasty. The problem? GET NEW SERVERS. God! I went there with 3 other friends about 2 weeks ago. It wasn't crowded or overly busy. (the last time I went, I chalked the bad service up to "too busy" and nothing else...wrong) After we were seated, it took our server 10 minutes to find our table (you think they'd provide these people with maps or something). When he DID finally saunter over, the chip on his shoulder was obvious and apparently to heavy to carry. He was distracted while we ordered and managed a lukewarm smile at the end of our "arduous and difficult" ordering process. Then, after finally having to find a person that seemed to be in charge, our food was delivered to our table...30 MINUTES LATER. Mind you, nothing we ordered was involved or particularly complicated (last I checked, you slap ground beef between 2 slices of bread and Bam! you've got a hamburger) . I think I got my drink refilled once, maybe twice in the hour we were there. Ugh... Now, I don't mean to be harsh, but as someone who has chosen customer service as a profession, I find this sort of behavior to be unacceptable and highly immature. So, sadly, I don't think we'll be returning for quite a while.
