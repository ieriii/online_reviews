I've now eaten here twice and loved both experiences. The bar staff is very helpful in selecting the best beer for your meal. I've now had 4-5 of their beers and have loved everyone.  My most recent meal was a bit of a trip on the wild side. I've been hearing Anthony Bourdain talk about Sweetbreads for a number of years and finally took the plunge on the advice of the staff. THEY WERE AMAZING. Slightly crunchy, meaty and a little sweet. Looking forward to having them again sometime. On top of that the charcuterie plate and taste of hams is to die for. I highly recommend this place if you like delicious meats and great beer.
