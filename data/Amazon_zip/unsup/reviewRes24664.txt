Went to Geja's for our first anniversary. When making the reservation, they asked if it was a special occassion and they had a nice congratulatory card prepared for us at the table which I thought was a very nice touch. The food was awesome - For the first cheese fondu, you don't pick the type of cheese which my wife would have preferred, but we both loved it though. We ordered the seafood and beef and chicken which was a really good combination. You also get several vegetables along with several dipping sauces. The food was awesome, especially the beef and the scallops. The amount of food they give you is just perfect as well. I usually eat a lot and I was worried we'd be short, but by the end we ate everything on the tray and felt great afterwards. Dessert was great - roasted marshmallows, fruit with chocolate dipping sauce. The atmosphere and service at Geja's awesome. It's very dark and the server needs a mini light to show us the menu but it makes for great ambiance. Our server was awesome (Tracy I believe) and she did an excellent job at explaining options and cooking procedures. All in all, a first class joint with high quality food.
