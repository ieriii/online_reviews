First and most important, Sushi to me was good, not excellent or "OMG" but good. I should note that typically I'm not a fan of sushi so it may take better than average to win me over. Second, make a reservation. I was one of the first to arrive for our party so we did wait until everyone came before checking in for our 8:30p reservation. That said, I was able to watch several groups walk in/out and get the response from the hostess that the wait will be hour or two. Of course, all seemed annoyed which I deduced from the eye rolls, arm movements, and language. Moral of this story is make a reservation! They also are more than happy to allow you to open your BYOB (awesome) beverage in the waiting section (only room for 10 or so). They do offer the ability to take your number and call you when a table is ready. Third, the bathroom is single use. Given the number of tables in the restaurant and already established high volume of patrons. This really was annoying. Also, our table was close so there would be 3/4 ladies waiting (felt like lurking) at any given time. Overall it was an enjoyable experience but felt a bit crowded in regards to table space, walking room, bathrooms and waiting area.
