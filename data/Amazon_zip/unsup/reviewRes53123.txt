Stopped by here again for an afternoon meal and sat outside this time. The music was a bit louder than I'd care for as it made conversation a bit stifled, but overall, a quaint outside area. They have the cover up to keep the rain out and the heaters are set up for when the real chill sets in. I enjoyed the patio area it is quite cute. The food is still amazing and I will be back for more.
