I must say, i never knew that fried chicken was a Korean thing. Who'd thought. And they do such a great job. I like KFC or Popeye's as much as any you of you. But the Korean variety, with the tangy spicy sauce...talk about finger lickin' good. I put away half a chicken in barely 3 minutes. and to have a bowl of bibimbap to go along with it? makes for a terrific meal. the restaurant is clean and bright, the counter people were really freindly. Can't complain much.
