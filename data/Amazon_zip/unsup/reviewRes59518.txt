Place has lots of side dishes. But that's about it. The beef is of the poorest quality. It is just plain horrible. Have been going to this place on and off over 10 years and it only gets worse. Anywhere else is better than here. Can not believe they are still open and even open another location in Niles. They are fooling all the non Koreans to going here. Do not waste your time this place just sucks.
