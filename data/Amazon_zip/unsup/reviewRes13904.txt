Big fan of Glenn's Diner - I've only had their bloody mary once, but it's like a small appetizer with a skewer of shrimp in it and it's good! Their crab cake eggs benedict is one of the best I've ever had.  The crab cake is full of chunks of crabs - they don't skimp on the crabs like many places do and the hollandaise sauce is creamy and lemony. My friend had the corned beef hash and that was good as well.
