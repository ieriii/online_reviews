We didn't have the best experience at Brazzaz. First of all: Meat was very good. Servers were very, very nice. Salad bar was good. Sides were OK. Complaints: 1. I called ahead and asked about the price. The hostess told me clearly it was $38.99 a person for dinner. I asked her to confirm that it was $38.99 a person, which she did. She also told me that six and under was free and 7-10 was half price. When we got our bill, we were charged incorrectly for an extra dinner, which the waiter corrected for us. But it wasn't until later that I realized that we were charged $48.99 for each dinner and not $38.99. At 7 dinners, that is a substantial difference. 2. Our meal took a very, very long time. About half way through our dinner, another large group got up to leave and another large group sat down at their table. The second large group finished at the same time we did. We were there 2.5 hours, and 30 minutes of that time was waiting for desserts. 3. We were having a birthday, and someone in our party started the night by giving the hostess a nice tip and asking her to make sure we got a "surprise" birthday cake. Unfortunately, this hostess (see #1 above) never communicated this to the servers, so no cake came. I felt bad for the servers, who were very apologetic, since they never got the message. All in all, the food was pretty good. The salad bar was not as nice as Fogo. The servers were very nice - they did the best they could, and I appreciate that. But given the very poor showing by the hostess and the extra $75 we paid for her price mistake, I have to leave a poor rating.
