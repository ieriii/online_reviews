*Extremely disappointed* I booked the Hilton solely because of the University of Chicago shuttle deal, where you can stay and get a free shuttle to and from the university. I knew I would be going to Hyde Park quite a few times and the shuttle was worth it. When I arrive, they tell me that because I checked off the AAA rate, they can't give me the U of C deal, which they did not state on their website. So, I tell the agent I will pay the difference in rate. Nope. It's an "online only" deal. Fine, then I want to cancel and rebook online. Nope. The front desk agent Morgan was extremely rude and rolled her eyes while talking to me. If you hate your job, get a new one! ---- The room itself was fine. Clean, soft towels, king sized bed, flat screen, good bath products... Also did not like the $2 per item coat check. But I did like the coffee shop in the lobby and the general liveliness.
