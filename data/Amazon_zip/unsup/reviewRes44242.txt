Went to Wakamono at the recommendation of a friend of a friend, who raved that the sushi was the best in town. We sat inside since it was raining...enjoyed the atmosphere of the restaurant, very sleek and sophisticated. I'd really like to sit outside next time, they have a nice little area set up. Our server was rushed and inexperienced, she spilled beer on my friend's skirt without apologizing and continually tried to take our half-full Sapporos away with her.... $5.00 corkage fee too. Loved the godzilla and dragon roll! We also had the spicy tuna and the Oedipus roll- these were not the best I've ever had but definitely not the worst. Pretty solid. Would come here again or order take-out for the sushi. And Wang's located next door looks like a little Asian dive bar that I'd love, definitely want to check that place out soon.
