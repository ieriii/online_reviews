Love Tank Noodle's pho - really flavorful broth, rich and spicy, accompanied with everything you want, firm noodles, handfuls of herbs, hoisin sauce, lime wedges, sriracha, onions - I could go on and on about Tank... Order pho for take out a lot as I can't often sit down in the restaurant but it travels well and does not disappoint - they are ready to get you in and out the door as quickly as possible, much appreciated
