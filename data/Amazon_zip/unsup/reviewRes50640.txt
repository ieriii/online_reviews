The hamburger is amazing. The craft beer selection makes me wiggly. In fact, all of the booze makes me wiggly. The selection is unique, and if you happen to pop in when the owner is bartending, he will talk your ear off. Actually, any of the servers will talk your ear off. I like a waitstaff that knows their booze. Our waitress more or less demanded that we get dessert, and threw it in for free. It was a few months ago, but I'm pretty sure it was Mississippi Mud Pie and it was tasty. The marshmallows on top were vaguely citrusey and quite delicious.
