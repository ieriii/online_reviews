While I love brick oven, Italian style pizza, I just don't see myself going back here unless Pizza DOC closes its doors. That being said, if it weren't for Pizza DOC, this would probably be my favorite pizza in the city; I have tried many. The buffalo mozzerella was good but it's just too watery. I have some friends that swear by this place but it's not better than DOC so....
