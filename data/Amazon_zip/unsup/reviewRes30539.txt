This place is amazing! My friends surprised me and took me here for my birthday. Let's just say I was plenty surprised by this place. This place specializes in New Asian Fusion dishes. We got there around 830 pm on a friday night so this place was packed. Luckily my friends made reservations so we were seated quite quickly. The Steam Bao Buns with Pork Belly is simply amazing. The pork just melts in your mouth. The Lemongrass Beef Lollipops were delicious. The beef was nicely seasoned and went rather well with the lemongrass "skewer." When I saw they had Adobo Braised Pork Belly, I knew I had to try it. I am so glad I did. This dish instantly became my favorite here. The flavors just melded together so well, I didn't want it to end. We also got the Longevity Garlic Noodles, which were pretty good. It was a simple dish with nice garlic flavor that wasn't too overpowering. The Crispy Pata dish was pretty delicious. It was a bit dry in my opinion, but not everything can be as mouthwatering as what my mom makes. Overall I loved this place. The food was delicious, the atmosphere was loud and welcoming, the staff was very friendly, and expensive. I recommend making reservations, especially if you plan on eating during peak hours. Be ready to talk loudly as well since all of the other patrons are constantly trying to talk over each other. This place is great.
