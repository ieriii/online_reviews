Stayed here on business in Feb 2012. Overall, it's fine.The best thing about the theWit for me is that it is immediately located on the CTA Brown line. I was able to get to the Merchandise Mart in 10 minutes and the rail could take me to various parts of The Loop so I could easily get to various eating establishments. (By the way, I highly recommend taking a short walk to Wildberry for breakfast!)Other observations:Big, warm oatmeal cookie offered upon check in.Fast internet connection.Decor and facilities are comfy and well-maintained.Didn't care for the shallow, square sink because water splashed everywhere.
