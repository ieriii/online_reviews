Are you all out of your minds? It's a flippin hot dog stand!!! I've tried most of the regular dogs and a few specialty sausages and they are good but certainly not worth waiting in line for more than 10 minutes let alone an hour. And yes I've had the duck fat fries(a few years ago early and only waited 10 minutes). Are the fries good? I guess but it's a flippin french fry. Don't get me wrong, I like the place and Doug is really nice but something is going on in Avondale. I think it's something in the water making you fools wait in line for an hour for sausages and burgers from Kuma's.
