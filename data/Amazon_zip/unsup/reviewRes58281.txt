I LOVED XOCO! It was amazing! My friends and I were on a whirlwind trip to Chicago, there for 36 hours then go home, so we wanted to go to only the best places. Well we chose right! I went to xoco not knowing what i was going to get, so I ordered something that sounded interesting: Pork Belly Caldos, not knowing what caldos was. We went at about 3:30 and got to order right away and our food came out in 10 minutes. Our food came and i went oh it's soup semi disappointedly. Well that didn't last very long because it was AMAZING! It looked so beautiful, golden broth, fresh green arugula, toasted sesame seeds, fresh avocado, zucchini, mushrooms, tender vermicelli at the bottom, and of course pork belly. I didn't talk too much with my friends during that meal because i was eating this wonderful food and i really didn't want to share. ;) My friend got a churro and it was really good too. I got soft serve ice cream with salted carmel sauce on top, again amazing. Not only did we eat this awesome food, then we saw Rick Bayless himself (our group was happy as we had some Bayless superfan's with us) and he was talking to a man who looked familiar to me. The man turned around and it was Art Smith! I couldn't believe it! 2 great chefs that had both competed on Top Chef Masters standing 10 feet from me! The day could not have gotten any better. But it did! Art Smith came and talked to us! He was so genuinely friendly! Needless to say, 25 hours later we were back for late afternoon lunch. I had talked about the Pork Belly soup so much that everyone but one in my group got it too (the other got the veggie and black bean caldos). I will be back again!
