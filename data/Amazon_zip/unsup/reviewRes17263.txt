great place for intimate conversations amongst two to four friends (anything bigger, and it starts to lose its charm.) you are not going to be able to meet randoms, nor really people watch (except in line.) but be prepared to have interesting discussions over some nice drinks. the drinks are good, but a bit strong (which leads to them being a pricey $12 as well.) for my money, i'd rather get the cocktails at the whistler in logan square ($8 and taste better), though the two places have a completely different vibe. the food is good, but limited. it works if you only want something to nosh on. if you're hungry, eat first, and come back later. the atmosphere is a nice change of pace, and i appreciate them trying to do things the "proper' way. however, the signage announcing this (in line and in the restrooms) come off as way too snotty. i dislike the grey goose meme as well, but i don't tell people that up front to make myself look smarter. i'll definitely go back, but probably will limit my trips to non-weekend evenings with the wife, or with a couple of friends wanting a place to chill by ourselves without the music getting in the way.
