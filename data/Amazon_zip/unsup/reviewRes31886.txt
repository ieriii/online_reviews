I finally tried Demera after passing it many times when seeing shows at the Aragon, or hitting up the Vietnamese restaurants just a bit north.  There were six of us so we decided to go with the meat and veggie messob for the table. I have to admit when the injera and multitude of meat and veggies arrived I didn't think it was going to be enough because I am a hog. Seriously this girl can eat. But in the end the injera - which is a spongy bread that falls somewhere between crepe and wetsuit - really does fill you up.  Everything I had was delicious and very spicy and flavorful. This is the perfect place for a large party. The family style sharing makes ordering easy. Most of the bottles of wine are $27. My only complaint is the ambiance (and reason for ditching a star). It felt too bright and there was no music playing at first. But this would not deter me from returning in the future.
