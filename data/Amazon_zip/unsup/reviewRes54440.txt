AWFUL - for $8.99 i almost walked out. There are certain things that are unacceptable when it comes to diners. First, crap food. 2nd Cold Food. 3rd Low quality. I actually think Burger King would have been better minus the meat. Eggs were flat, hard omelette like things that were way over cooked and hard. The home fries were deep fried nuggets that tasted like they had been sitting for a while and cold uncooked peppers on them. The fruit it came with was super thin and looked like it had come off the person's plate before me. The pancake if that is what it was -unedible! Really surprised there is a line out the door on this place some days. def. not a foodie joint. Go their only for the plaid wearing hipsters with tattoos - Not the food. I want my money back!
