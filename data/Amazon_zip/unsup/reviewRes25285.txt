I went to Pequod's pizza because I like unique restaurants and I heard about the caramelized crust. We walked into a dimly lit room very reminiscent of a bar. I have tried many different deep dish places during my stay in Chicago and have to admit that Pequod's is unique. We got a deep dish with peppers and pineapples (goes against the cardinal rule of getting sausage or pepperoni with pizza, but I hadn't seen pineapple offered in deep dish before). It was very pleasant, but not typical deep dish pizza. It was much lighter than most pizzas. There wasn't that much cheese, in all honesty. The crust made up a lions share of the pizza. The cheese was not much more than you would get at a typical carry out pizza place (like Papa Johns) and the toppings were clearly added as an afterthought rather than being cooked in (maybe the pineapple wouldn't have done well to be baked for so long, but I was kind of disappointed). The caramelized crust had a slightly unique taste, but it was an aftertaste rather than an overpowering flavor (honestly, not worth going just for the crust). Maybe I got an off day, but I wasn't overly impressed. It was pleasant and I felt much better than I normally do after eating deep dish, but this is because they seem to skimp on cheese. If you are dieting or don't want to feel bloated, this could be a good deep dish place for you. The service was fine and the place was clean. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't great. I've certainly had worse and had better.
