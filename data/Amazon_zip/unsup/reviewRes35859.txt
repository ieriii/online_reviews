After two bites, my friend was in the restaurant bathroom for over an hour. He hadn't eaten 3 hours prior, and had not been drinking. The maitre'd asked for a driver's license before asking if he was ok. Instant food poisoning from salmon. Just be careful. If you're looking for a nice but casual, less-chain-restaurant feel, head up to Davis St. Fishmarket in Evanston.
