After 2 years of living in the city, I thought I had had it with brunch spots- I can buy all the necessary ingredients to feed myself and all of my friends for around the same amount I'm spending on an omelette and some orange juice, neither of which are ever worth the 45 minutes I have to wait to be seated, despite the fact that by the time my food arrives I'm generally ready to eat my own arm.  Until Meli's! Meli's has changed my brunch skepticism. You'll still be waiting a long time- I waited over 30 minutes for a table for 2, hence the 4 rather than 5 star rating- but it'll be worth it. I had the gouda omelette which for sure makes my brunch all-time top 5 list and my brunch counterpart had one of the scrambler specials which he enjoyed, as well as the homemade jams. It's a bit pricey for brunch but if you finish your meal you're likely to be full for the rest of the day, so it works itself out. If possible, try this place during the week, to avoid the crowds.
