Atmosphere: Fine Service: Excellent Price: Fair Food: OK I love the people here very helpful, friendly and the service was excellent! I was a little disappointed in the food! Combo Fried Rice; the meat was funky, Green Curry with Chicken was good but the eggplant was raw, The Pad See Ewe delicious. Too many Thai Restaurants in Chicago so we won't be back for a while.
