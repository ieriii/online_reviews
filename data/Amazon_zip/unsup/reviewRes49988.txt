I smelled this place from down the street, so I had somewhat of an idea what we were getting in to - lots of meat. We were seated promptly on a Friday night (looks like we were just lucky, though, because the place was packed and a line formed shortly after our arrival). It took the wait staff a while to get around to water and taking our order - we started with an arepa (cornbread sandwich) and it was fantastic. My partner ordered the Combinaciones - steak and shrimp. I ordered the same - steak and calamari. While the shrimp was good, the calamari was chewy and overcooked. The steak was mind blowing! I suggest you skip the combinations all together and go for the steak only. Yucca, plantain, potato - just filler in my opinion. Nothing special about them and I never got around to eating them. The chimichurri sauces were quite good - although I'm not sure you even need them. We were stuffed and didn't order dessert although it looked awesome. I would definitely come back here!
