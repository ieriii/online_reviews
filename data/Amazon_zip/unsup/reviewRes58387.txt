Very good food. Nice presentation. Excellent service.  Come with a hearty appetite because there is mucho de foodo (No, I don't know Portuguese) is served.  It seems especially popular with guys, because most tables we saw on our visit were all-guys or predominantly guys, who evidently like to eat a lot of meat. If you don't like meat, you probably should skip this place.It's not a place to go to every week, at least not for me. Plan on spending easily $60-70 bucks a head, because the main service basically comes to about $50 for the customary, salad bar and all the meat you can eat, minus beverages and dessert. And, those servers watch those cards on the table carefully and have effective service, so cover up your card or take it away if you are finished.  Bravo.
