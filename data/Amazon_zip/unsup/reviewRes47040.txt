We were really excited about Uncommon Ground. You might think that the special $75 per person meal and experience would be pretty good at UG. Well, think again, it was awful! Add to that drinks that are $10-12 a piece and a tip...not to mention that they were going to charge us a fee of $25 per person if we couldn't keep our reservation. Right before the band went on... = ( they closed the doors to the music room! WHAT! I have more to add to this overall terrible experience so if you are interested...the story only gets better...come back later for more details.
