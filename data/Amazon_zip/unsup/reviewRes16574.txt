I saw all the positive reviews here so I was curious and took the risk to try Indian food for the first time. First of all, I went out to lunch by myself, a 19-year old girl all by herself. It is not the weird people. All the waiters were staring at me the whole time I was eating. That was super rude. The food was okay. I would never have it again. I had this one pickle with a really weird sauce and it killed my mouth with its horrible taste. I did like one of the desserts - a sticky ball or something like that. But not the broth that came with it cuz it was super sweet and I don't love sweet stuffs. They did give me a huge portion of this flat bread and the chicken and said it came with the buffet. I couldn't finish one thirds of it so I asked if I could bring that home cuz u know, I paid for everything. but they said no. WTF??? I already paid. That thing was huge, even 2 of me couldn't have finished it. So that huge portion is the reason why the price ended up being $18 for just me, instead of $8 like it said on the big board placed in from of the restaurant. WTF ??? Anyway, I felt super uncomfortable the whole time. I mean, who can eat with everyone in the restaurant staring at her? And I am just a regular person, I dressed nice, looked good. I just went out for lunch, on my own. It is NOT that weird. Terrible service. NEVER EVER COME BACK !!!!!!!
