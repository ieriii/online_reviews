First, you should know that I LOVE Mexican food...BUT I don't believe all foods can be served gourmet style. Some things were just not meant to be. All the great Mexican food I've ever had always comes from a cart, a truck, or a hole in the wall restaurant. Frontera Grill is aesthetically pleasing, the servers are very friendly, and the artwork and atmosphere is certainly lively. You pay for gourmet prices, but sadly, you don't get what you pay for. As an appetizer, I ordered the tortilla soup which was delicious at first, but half way through I realized was much too salty. For lunch, the four of us ordered the mole chicken enchiladas, the duck quesadillas, the duck enchiladas, and the chicken and shrimp combo. Anything that had chicken in it was too dry. The mole sauce was a strange blend of too sweet and salty, and the sauce was clumpy, like chili. I've never had such thick mole sauce before. The duck enchiladas were probably my favorite because it wasn't too dry like the mole enchiladas, but DUCK in Mexican food is a little too weird for me. The shrimp was good, and the quesadillas were good too, just a tad on the greasy side. The salad that comes with every dish is very bitter, but I don't really like radish or feta cheese. Oh, and almost everything (even the beans) comes with feta cheese on top. For dessert, we had churros and I ordered a hot chocolate with almond milk. The churros were great, the hot chocolate was very, very rich! It was like drinking a bottle of hot Hershey's syrup straight from the bottle. Like with everything else we ate, I noticed that it was good at first then after awhile...it became too much.
