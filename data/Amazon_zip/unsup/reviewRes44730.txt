I can't believe there are people here complaining that the deep dish tastes...of...cheese. Really? Giordano's has my favorite deep dish. It's just a matter of taste. Often Uno's is too spicy, and Lou Malnati's...why do people like them so much? It's completely flavorless. I really like their cheese garlic bread as well. Maybe some hole in the wall has a better deep dish. It's certainly possible. But if you are looking for a 4-star, satisfying experience for all--you certainly could do much worse.
