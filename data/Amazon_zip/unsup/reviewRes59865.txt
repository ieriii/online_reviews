Not only was this the best steak I've had in Chicago, it was the best halibut I've had as well. One normally doesn't go to a chophouse for seafood, but it is great to know that the options at Kinzie's are not limited to beef! Both fish and meat were seared and spiced to perfection, extremely flavorful and moist, and were complemented by the freshest ingredients. Our server, Servando, was a super helpful character with a great sense of humor. He brought out a meat tray for us to see the cuts of meat before choosing from the 13 steak options. To top it off, the dessert was outstanding - the creme brule was superb and chocolate terrine rich and light. The ambiance is certainly elegant, yet unpretentious. I cannot recommend this place enough!
