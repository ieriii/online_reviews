If I weren't so impatient I'd roll 5 stars. It's not their fault they can't service all us as quickly as we'd like. Their food rocks, people know it, so people show up.The wide options are great and duck fat fries are to die for.I'd go more often if it weren't for the wait time and the fact that all of the fat in the food makes my stomach crazy.
