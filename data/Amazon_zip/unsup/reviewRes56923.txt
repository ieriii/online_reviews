I had never heard of New Haven pizza before coming here, but I am now a fan. The thin crust is a nice change from the way-too-filling Chicago style pizza (which I have to admit I love too). There are some very interesting pizza toppings although you can definitely order standard pepperoni/sausage/veggie as well. We had a large group and ordered one with mashed potatoes and bacon, which was surprisingly good. Not something I would really need more than one piece of, but fun to try nonetheless. The chocolate dessert pizza was also wonderful- the fact that I absolutely love Nutella probably helps :) If you can get a spot in the cove to the left of the door, it is probably the best place to sit. It's far less loud and is a great place for bigger parties. Overall, I would definitely recommend Piece.
