Greek Islands has become our go to place when we want greek food. Especially when we have guests in town. I'll say that we do have an extensive Greek Town in this city and that we've tried a handful of restaurants off of Halsted, but something keeps us coming back to Greek Islands despite the long wait that can happen during busy hours. It's a combination of their great food, amazing service and reasonable prices that will keep me coming back to this place. There's never been a time that I've had a horrible experience and this is one place that I can always go to that will always be consistent.
