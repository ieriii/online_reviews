I stopped in for lunch at Mayan Palace last week with my mom & 2 year old son. They were terrific. It was a late lunch so it wasn't too crowded, but their attentiveness was still unprecedented. The minute I walked in they were friendly and helpful. Cleaning the high chair to make sure it was spotless (it looked clean to me to begin with!), helping my son in, bringing water immediately, and bringing my son a free special cheese dip. Throughout the meal the service remained fabulous. The food was also delicious. The tortilla soup was fantastic. I ate waaaay too much. Is it the best mexican you'll find in Chicago? Probably not. Is it really tasty? Yep. And when you are so attentive and kind to a toddler, instead of looking terrified when we walk in the door, you'll forever win my love and affection.
