Little Bucharest was awesome! Great beers, wines, appetizers, and entrees. Live music! Great service! Perfect place for a B Day party or any group get-together. Our server, Ana, was really cute too. The owner is like a Vegas Host! Top shelf as they say in Vegas!BTW-Try the Javameister.... Cheeky...
