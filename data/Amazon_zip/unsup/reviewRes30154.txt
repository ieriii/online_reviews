Food is good. Milkshakes are AMAZING! (and vegan:) It's always packed here (and it's pretty small, including the outdoor patio) so you might have to wait for a little bit, but it's WORTH IT for one of those milkshakes! Chocolate peanut-butter cookie dough is my favorite. Yum!  AND THEY HAVE A PARKING LOT!! It can be deceiving, it's actually a small alley to the left side of the building, you could pass it without knowing... never the less there is adequate parking and having a parking lot in Lakeview is fantastic! Parking can be a nightmare in this neighborhood not to mention the Chicago parking authorities are absolutely crazy & ticket happy (to put it nicely).
