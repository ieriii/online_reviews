I don't get places like this, but I try. Carnivale. You can sum it up like this, it's big, it's loud, and it's trendy. You total all 3 together and get an overpriced, over-hyped, and unsatisfying restaurant experience.  Reservations are required, and judging from my experience and the shoulder to shoulder crowd in the lounge, they don't mean much. Our reservations were for 8pm, and for an hour and 10 minutes I drank 2 $5 beers and bumped body parts with about 50 people until 9:10pm when we were finally seated. It's inexplicably to me how a restaurant can do business like this. (As with other posts, I can't stand waiting longer than 10 to 15 minutes if I made reservations. It's unacceptable.) I will say, as a caveat, our group was made up of 12, which makes seating much more difficult, but it's not an hour and 10 minutes difficult. The service was average. It wasn't equal to the gratuity paid for it. (Our server was little creepy. Long haired pony-tail dude. Just seemed weird. I know, I know, never judge a book by it's cover.) The food itself was average, nothing crazy. I had a flank steak of some sort. It wasn't memorable. So, I probably ordered the wrong the thing. The bill was about 60 a piece, and when you are at 60 a piece you should just skip this place and go to a nicer restaurant, even if you spend slightly more.  I will say, the one very, very cool thing about Carnivale is the 'IN' factor it has. The patrons, male/female, were great for people watching. Sitting next to my girlfriend it was really hard not to notice women that were dressed incredibly sexy. (I am sure the men were the same, but wasn't paying too much attention there.) The crowd did appear to be, overwhelmingly female making Carnivale the type of place the ladies visit before going out on the town for the night.  In the end it just felt like a bigger, louder version of Adobe Grill.
