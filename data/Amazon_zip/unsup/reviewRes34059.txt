Why does everyone love this place so much? Everyone I know takes visiting friends and relatives here as if it is the showpiece restaurant of the city. I got fooled into doing this about a year ago. I took my aunt and uncle there with my girlfriend. The food is fine, even good I guess, but... About halfway through my meal (some kind of pasta with meat) I bit into something hard. I pulled it out of my mouth to discover that I had bitten into a string of STEEL WOOL. I showed it to the waiter, and he said "I'm sorry, that is from one of our scrub brushes in the kitchen, it happens every once in a while." He asked me if I would like another meal. I did not because I was halfway finished and this sort of thing doesn't really effect my desire to finish the meal. I was just glad that it happened to me and not one of the people that I had invited there. Of course my meal was free, but that does not change the fact that they were not surprised to find BRILLO PADS in the food.
