I am not a vegetarian, but I have been here a few times and never walked away thinking I got an outstanding meal. Here's the thing-odd soy protein masquerading as meat is gross unless you have some condition that prohibits you from eating meat. I love vegetables. If I could never eat meat again, I'd like this place, but since I do love meat, everything here tastes like air trying to taste like meat, and that's weird. It is never awful, just not exceptional. I guess vegetarians can appreciate it more since it does give them a lot of options, but for my money I'm going where I think the food is great, and not just decent and meat-free.
