I know it's a sin to go to a steakhouse such as this and not order steak, but...the man and I were in the mood for some seafood! We went for Valentine's Day dinner just before 8pm and the place was busy but not crazy packed. We ordered the crab cakes appetizer, the man ordered the stuffed chicken breast and I ordered the chilean sea bass, along with a baked potato and a bottle of riesling. Dessert was a slice of carrot cake with a side of vanilla ice cream. Everything was absolutely delicious, but the best part of the night was our waiter Chris--he was on top of everything and was very efficient and personable---we had a wonderful dinner in a cozy atmosphere!
