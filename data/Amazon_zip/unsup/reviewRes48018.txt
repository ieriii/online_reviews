4 star dinner, 3 star brunch. Let's talk about the brunch. You have to go to this place expecting heavy meat based plates, obviously, it's a pork house. We started with three of the bakery items - all duds. Dry and bland seemed to be the theme across the three. Fail. I had the pork shoulder over kale and polenta. Fantastic. Very heavy, but well flavored and cooked properly. Take the pickled calliflower out and throw it on the floor - its very disrupting in the flavors of the dish. BUT, I definitely recommend - just don't get any of the starters.
