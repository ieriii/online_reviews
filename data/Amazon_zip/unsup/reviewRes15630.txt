Ok, What the F?? I agree with everything J.S. said in her review. Especially with the music.. ugh the music, service and those square ottomans.. what are we suppose to do on those, lay back? lay on our sides? While drinking our cocktails? Stupido! Anyway, all I'd like to add really is: BAHAHAHAHA, and Bitch PLEASE... Portland might even have you beat in this department. I miss the vintage cocktails at Echo in NE Portland..
