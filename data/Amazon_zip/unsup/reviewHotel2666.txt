Again, this is sort of cheating, as I never actually slept here. But I went to visit a colleague of mine who was staying here last fall, and her minibar came stocked with none other than a travel bullet vibrator.  Wait, it gets better. The cute little thing also came in a discreet carrying case, replete with a condom, mini bottle of lube, and the appropriately sized batteries. !!! We giggled uncontrollably, of course, and then promptly called the front desk and ordered eight more, one for each of the ladies in our office. They brought them up that evening in a nice little gift bag, perfect for my friend to carry back on the plane with her. Honestly, the room could have smelled like sewage at this point and I still would have given the hotel a top rating. It's these special little touches that are really so important.
