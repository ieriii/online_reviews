I like BBQ. If the meat is fall of the bone and the sauce is good, then you've got good bbq ribs. Chicago Q has pretty good ribs, some better than others, and I enjoyed it all and ate alot. But I feel like there are better places for ribs. I would give the place 4 stars for taste, service, atmosphere, but the price point was a little high. I'd go back to try other items tho. The pickles are the best! Couldn't get enough of them.
