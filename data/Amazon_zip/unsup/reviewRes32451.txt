Sometimes Yelp amazes me. Over 300 people rated this place 3.5 stars and thats exactly what this restaurant is. Above average but at the same time very disappointing. We ordered 6 different dishes here....2 were disgusting (so bad that I thought what was the chef thinking) and 3 were absolutely amazing (genius). How can a place be so inconsistent? First the good: The duck salad was phenomenal. It an amazing balance of sweatness and texture with the fried dicon. Probably the best salad I have ever had in my life. The next dish we had was the pork belly, which was succulent and plentiful. Finally, for dessert I had the taro bread pudding, which was soft and complex as the taro taste didnt come through until the end of the bite....but pervaded the dessert. All 3 of these dishes were 5 stars. Now the bad...and its really really bad. We had the kobe beef tar tare which looked unappetizing. I;ve never had dog food before but I imagine thats how it would taste. The garlic noodles were overcooked and they used the wrong noodles (your not supposed to use flat noodles for this dish). It was also warm, when it should be served cold. Finally, we had a tuna tar tar served on cracker/wonton. It wasnt that bad but nothing special. This place has so much potential. If they fixed a few things it could easily be a 4 or 5 star restaurant.
