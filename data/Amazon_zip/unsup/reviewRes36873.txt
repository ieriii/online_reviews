This place rocks my socks. So much so that when I'm having a bad day, like today with snow in the forecast and the huge pile of work that followed me home, I console myself by ordering some out-of-this-world crab rangoon and fried rice from Indie Thai. I've also had the sushi and it was very fresh-tasting, with beautiful presentation. It's also BYO Wine at the restaurant, delivery is fast and courteous, and I have nothing to add to the other reviews here except to say that you simply must stop by Indie if you are in the neighborhood. And order the crab rangoon!
