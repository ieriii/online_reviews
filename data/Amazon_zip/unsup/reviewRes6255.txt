I am not crazy about Italian food, but this place is great. Despite the long wait, I always enjoy coming here. The interior is absolutely fantastic. It creates intimate, cozy and fun atmosphere perfect for couples or friends to chat. The ceilings, floors, decor elements and functional exposition of their goods is amazing. The wine is sold by glass, bottle or quartino. The prices are really cheap, so you can try different wines without fully emptying your wallet. The service was also great.  This is the place to go.
