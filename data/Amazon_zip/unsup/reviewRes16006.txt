Love this restaurant! If you are looking for a colorful, vibrant place with a great music selection and Latin America food, then you will love Carnivale. I ordered the ceviche variety plate since I love ceviche and it was very good. If you are on a tight budget then I would not suggest going here...the price is high for the portion recieved. The ambiance is amazing and if you dont make a reservation, you will wait quite some time. The service was also excellent! Overall loved Carnivale and I would go back anytime I was in downtown Chicago!
