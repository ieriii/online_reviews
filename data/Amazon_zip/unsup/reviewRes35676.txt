It was a treat coming here for our first meal (feast might be more accurate) of the Chinese New Year, courtesy of our nephew. I can't imagine a better Peking Duck, and for reference, I've had it in Beijing, at the famous place by the Emperor's Summer Palace (I had to look it up out of curiosity - Quan Jude). Sun Wah's new location on Broadway is really nice for an authentic Chinese place - spacious, clean, comfortable with big tables, and with maybe the largest dining room in either of our two Chinatowns. Dining room has a modern loft feel to it with exposed brick walls and ductwork.  BBQ chicken was also uniquely tasty - with deeply marinated BBQ flavor and crispy skin, and juicy white meat underneath. The highlight though was the duck, which was expertly carved tableside by Kelly, the senior sibling co-owner of Sun Wah. The crispy skin slices were expertly thin with meat attached, making for a lot of duck portions for our buns. I only know her name is Kelly because of the Tribune's timely article on the place this week. I'm assuming I won't be fined by Yelp for posting this third party link: http://www.chicagotribun Ok, service was a litle slow on the duck, but the place was packed, and I think you have to factor in the value aspect, which was excellent as we had several other excellent courses as well. So overall, I think the value offset the little slower service on a packed New Year's Day Sunday, so I still go with 5 stars. We'll defiinitely be back.  This place is another example (like Chi Cafe in old Chinatown) of how Chicago Chinatown dining is rapidly changing for the better with the times.   ps - Besides street parking, and at least on the weekends, there are a couple of narrow parking lots nearby on Broadway you can pull into (sign is labeled employee and visitor parking).
