i've been here before--- i don't know why i didn't remember--- i guess i wasn't impressed--- i went here for dinner- nothin special--- so i came here over the weekend for breakfast--- so--- we were seated immediately--- always a great thing--- Brendan was our waiter. the fact i can get a bloody mary to go with breakfast was a great idea--- very tempting--- though after drinking friday night--- liquor was the last thing on my mind---- i needed food and i needed it asap---- i actually went with my friend, Anna and her aunt and cousin--- Anna started off with getting a Mississippi mud--- its supposed to be like a 'southern style thai tea---' i don't know what they were thinking but to me it just seems like a latte with extra cream--- in a pint glass--- it was weird--- everyone else got water--- FOODWISE--- Anna got....carrot/pumpkin pancakes--- and a side of the apple chicken gouda cheese sausage--- pancakes are orgasmic fluffy light and the right amount of sweetness i got the N.C. crabcakes--- cheesy grits baby! corn muffin... i love grits--- and well the corn muffin a bit dry for my taste---- needs some sweet butter- Anna's Aunt got the banana blackberry pancakes--- yum! and her cousin got the Caprese Benedict--- i don't know if it was good or not sorry..... Anna didn't finish her food--- as always--- and asked for a box--- though we didnt get it til the bus lady came around was about to take anna's plate though we informed her that we wanted a box and she told our waiter who apparently forgot--- but that's ok its really busy ther but yea-- totally loved it.... i must say--- it's my new breakfast place--- and i hate to say but Sweet Maple's and Toast will have a special place in my heart---- but wishbone is convenient--- and yummy.
