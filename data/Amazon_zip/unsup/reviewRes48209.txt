Wish I could say I liked this place more. The food is great, although there's nothing I'm dying to go back and have a second time.  What I did not like was the atmosphere. It is SO loud. We were a group of 8 and I could not hear anyone except the person next to me. I felt like I was in a noisy cafeteria. It was not relaxing.  I was also kind of annoyed with our waitress, because when we would get excited to order things individually, she would look at us disapprovingly and tell us that is not really how it is done here. Whatever, I don't want to share, ok? She said she could not guarantee all our entrees will arrive at the same time, which is probably why they encourage the whole family style eating, even though most of what we ordered seemed to be more like individual entrees.
