I love this place, what a great introduction to Chicago! - extensive, original beer list (although i wish they had a one line description given they are so original!) - attentive service - great space - amazing food - Singaporean inspired Dungenes crab with red curry sauce (fresh sweet crab, solid curry sauce), Charcuterie plate (not for the faint hearted but for lovers of pork products) and pork belly (perfectly cooked, tasty, rich) I can't wait to go back.
