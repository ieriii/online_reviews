This place is pretty good. They don't have the best crepes in Chicago but my waitress made a point to tell us several times that the new menu would be available in a week. I'll probably go back to try some of the new items. I tried the salmon crepe, escargot crepe, and a big build-your-own salad. The salad was awesome. The veggies are roasted to perfection and served with fresh greens and cheese. The salads are huge and could easily be shared by two people. The escargot crepe was my favorite. It was filled with succulent escargot and melty brie. Also, they have fresh-made carrot juice and a wide selection of coffee drinks.
