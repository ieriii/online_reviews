Learned a valuable lesson. If you experience poor service, complain to the managers immediately! You might get your dessert comp'd at best. Don't bother using their website, nobody checks it. Was there with my son a week ago and didn't want to ruin the dining experience for him and thought I could communicate with the restaurant through their website. A week later no response. I followed up with a call and basically was told since I didn't address it that night, too bad and all they could do was refund the gratuity. How's that for customer service? No apology for not responding to my online correspondence or for the bad service. I escalated it to the owner and he was even worse. He definitely does not understand the concept of wanting repeat business.
