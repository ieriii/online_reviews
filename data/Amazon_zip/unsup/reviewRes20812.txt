Food: Excellent. Some of the best, if not the best bites of sushi I've had. Great menu and service. Atmosphere: Quite average. Busy and tight. Definitely not classy or romantic as many have said. Not swanky or classy, but fine. You're over-dressed if you're in anything much more than jeans. Atmosphere is only thing keeping me from 5 stars. Price: Not pricey at all. In fact, bordering on cheap for good sushi. If you want great sushi at great price all while keeping it very casual, this is the place to go.
