So I thought I would write a review of Fogo, especially since a special someone is coming to visit and wants to eat here (I'm pretty sure he is only in it for the meat!). I decided to hook my "meat and potato" family up with a great birthday dinner so this is where we went last year. The meat is top notch (esp. the lamb and the filet cuts) and the service is impeccable. I recommend steering as clear of the salad bar as possible and saving room for liquor and meat (caiparinia's in particular). This is a great 7 o'clock reservation place, followed by a long night of recovery on the couch. I'm looking forward to Round Two in June!
