Preamble: Party of four- ordered the duck the night before with no issue Lets just say this place is now the mayor of Bold City Flavors, USA on foursquare. We ordered the Singapore Mai Fun in addition to the Peking Duck Feast, that was really on point. Noodles were spicy and the pork, shrimp etc were good. The duck come out shortly thereafter, and at that point, i was staring at some all time food porn, you guys. Almost got cut while he was slicing the duck up because i wanted all the crunchy skin parts to myself, but it worked out. Bao's were tremendous...drumsticks were crunchy - again very bold. Duck fried rice was good - the fried rice wasnt incredible but the duck was a nice touch. Didn't really have room for the soup - this place gets the fifth star because of the price: whole bill with 1 drink apiece totaled to $22/per person. Yes i will be going back.
