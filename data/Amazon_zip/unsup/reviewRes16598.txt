I have enjoyed every visit to this place in the past few years. It is expensive, especially compared to the other local Indian restaurants, but the variety on their menu is good and the food is pretty authentic. My favorite is their lunch buffet. I love that they have fish curry as part of their buffet. It was cooked with fenugreek this past time and tasted amazing. The desserts were fresh and also yummy, the gulab jamun was hot and not overly sweet, just the way I like it. I was not too taken with the kheer (rice pudding), but enjoyed the mango kulfi. What I like best about the buffet is that they have a larger spread, compared to other Indian lunch buffets; the downside is that they are are definitely overpriced. I guess you pay for the variety of dishes and the location! Despite the price, I really like the food here....and I eat a lot of Indian food.
