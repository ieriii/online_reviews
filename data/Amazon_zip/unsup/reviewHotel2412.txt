WOW! I stayed here this past June for a company event. I was up in the very very nice Presidential Suite for two nights. This place was awesome! I had the lake view from my room, 2 beds, 2 bathrooms. Of all the places I've been to in the United States, this is the best hotel ever! Room service was prompt, the food was delicious, the employees were extremely friendly and courteous. If you're looking to book a company event, this is a great place to do it. This place will make an impression!
