I want to give this place five stars for the food. It is truly five star food. The egg sandwich croissant? OH. MY. GOD. But the service was so terrible, I can't honestly recommend anyone go there, save for takeout (do they do brunch takeout? that would be awesome.) From a snooty, snooty hostess with a 'holier-than-thou" attitude to an entirely absent waiter with a serious chip on his shoulder... it had me itching to eat and run. Sad. One of the best food spots I've been to.
