I have yet to go here, but it is my friends favorite place to go and she wants to meet there tonight. I always assumed it was just a tourist trap... It says here on yelp that the have happy hour specials, but when I called they said they don't know where I saw that, but they do not have a happy hour and the man was snippy... I think I will stick to my initial opinion and we will choose somewhere else.
