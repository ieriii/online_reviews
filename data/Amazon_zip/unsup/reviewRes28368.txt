Let me start by saying that my family has been going to El Nuevo Leon for over 30 years. My father is 100% Mexican and will only eat out for Mexican food at this family owned restaurant. It's safe to say that we are loyal fans. If you are looking for authentic Mexican food, this is probably the best in the country. Let me also mention that it's BYOB, which is friendly to the wallet. A little about their eats: their tortillas are made fresh daily and everything is made to order. Hence never a cold or re-cooked meal, ever! I've tried all their dishes at least once and my favorites are stuffed poblano peppers (chiles rellenos) and beef steak in a red sauce (bistek a la Mexicana.) They make killer nachos, and no, not the chips with the melted cheese topped off with jalapenos. We are talking individual nachos with beans at the bottom, topped with cheese, guacamole, ground beef, sour cream, and if you like you can add the jalapenos. They are to DIE FOR! I can eat these tasty nachos for dinner. The service is excellent given that they are always super busy. After going to this restaurant myself for 30+ years, I've has 1 bad experience and they comped all appetizers and gave us dessert on the house. You know they are doing something right. I hope this place stays around so that I can continue to recommend to all my out of town guests and to one day bring my kids too.
