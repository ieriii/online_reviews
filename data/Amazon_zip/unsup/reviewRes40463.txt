Exceptional. The level of intellect and skill in the kitchen at Longman & Eagle is on par with that of more upscale restaurants in Chicago. Four of us went for an early dinner to avoid the crowd/wait and were seated immediately around 5pm. Patio seating is available for those who enjoy al fresco dining. Longman & Eagle definitely feels like the place the 'cool kids' visit, but the atmosphere wasn't stuffy or pretentious. The crowd appeared to be in their twenties through mid thirties. The vibe was laid back, and the staff were friendly. Three friends and I shared 6 savory plates and 2 desserts. Everything was delicious. Really delicious. Given the portion sizes, I think the small plates and entrees might be better shared between 2 people instead of 4. The online menu was similar to the menu we were given at the restaurant, but some of the dishes were modified based on availability/seasonality of produce. I am so so so glad the BURGER (aged cheddar, bacon, beef fat fries) and GRUYERE DONUTS (maple syrup, parmesan, whipped citrus goat cheese) have remained on the menu since I first read about them months ago. I'm still dreaming about these two dishes. Incredible. The burger here and the dry aged burger at David Burke's Primehouse are my current favorites in Chicago. The beef fat fries that come with Longman & Eagle's burger are won-der-ful. These fries and the parmesan truffle cream fries at MK/DMK Burger Bar are my favorite fries of the moment. The gruyere donuts were different than any dessert or donut I've had. Warm, crispy donut. Oozy cheese interior. Cool, creamy, citrus goat cheese. Sweet maple syrup. Flavor party. Can't wait to return for brunch. Highly recommend.
