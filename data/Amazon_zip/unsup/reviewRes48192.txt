One of my favorite spots in Chicago. Level of service varies-I have had amazing service and spotty service. The vibe here is fun, casual, and maybe a bit hipster chic.  The menu is extensive and truly unique, with lots of stand bys. I enjoy the communal seating, however, the chairs are uncomfortable. It is extremely loud, but we keep going back for the amazing food. Bread is available upon request, make sure you request it. The desserts are divine. The roast chicken is the absolute best!
