Yum Yum Yum. I'm eating the leftovers as I write this. My eyes were bigger than my stomach last night and I just couldn't finish their 'Dagwood" sandwich like I thought I could. Best veggie spot I've been to. Hands down. Their "buffalo wings" are rediculously spicy, but their ranch could've used a little more veganaise to thicken it up. Still good. It's just me being nit-picky. Attentive staff and our food was on our table before we could finish ordering it. Go there. Now. Why are you still reading this?
