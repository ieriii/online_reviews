I want to like this place. It's in a great location and we often wind up here cause there's no where else to go. The atmosphere and space is great. How many restaurants have a library and big gorgeous tables? If you're coming to just have a beer, I'd give it 4 stars. But the food. Disappointing every time; there was a portabello sandwich that particularly disagreed with me. And not a lot for veg's to choose from. But I want to like it.
