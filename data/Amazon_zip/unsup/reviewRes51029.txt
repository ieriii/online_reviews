This place is so overrated I dont get what all the hype is about ? The food is bland The portions are riduculously tiny ,its usually always packed for weekend brunch so theres usually always a wait ,service is slow ? I dont get why people would actually want to eat at a place like this ? Maybe people who dont have anything else to compare real southern food to ? Cause last time I checked southern food was known for its flavor ,usually served in big portions (atleast portions that will fill you up and not make you go home with a grumbling stomach )and hopefully served by a friendly server with a smile ..not a trixie with a attittude .
