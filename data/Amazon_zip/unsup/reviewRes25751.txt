A great affordable neighborhood Vietnamese restaurant. The best Shrimp spring rolls in the city. The Pho soup is excellent. Other dishes I would recommend include the duck with bamboo shoots, chicken puffs, clay pot chicken pineapple calamari and asparagus with beef. The owner is always there and very gracious/friendly. I hit this about 3-4 times a month for a relatively healthy dinner. Not elite but very good. BYOB Enjoy
