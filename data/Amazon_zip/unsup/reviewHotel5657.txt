I stayed here with my wife and two adult daughters in early August 1012 and I'd have to say this was one of the best hotels I've ever stayed in and I've stayed at the Drake which is just down the street. Great service from the staff, great room with nice amenities, great location and delicious breakfast. This is where I'll stay when I go to Chicago.
