Summer afternoon delight: A Top Heavy with a (CHOKE GASP BEER SNOBS) big ol' lemon wedge on board. Pair it up with an individual white pizza with mashed taters and spinach and that's quite that. (Protip: Check your grill in the mirror before leaving!) Da Vinci Code Moment: Has anyone else ever looked at the ceiling in the lovely, beery daze that you get here in the trickling sunlight and noticed that the whole joint looks like a ship hull flipped over? I'll take the rest of my afternoon at Oak Street Beach-- if I don't get murdered by rushing North Ave traffic on my bike --and look out past the waves, wishing I could flip that whole place and bust it into the water, keel the roof into the deep and sail it out past the pumps. I'd love to be sipping another lovely Gold Cup Hefeweizen and watch the fishies swim through the skylight down below. Listen up busters: We named the DOG Indiana. Sit and have a beer in the true Lost Ark of Chicago.
