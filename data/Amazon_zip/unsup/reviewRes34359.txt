i had a wonderful brunch here on a slightly snowy saturday morning, around 10am. although the snow would have kept some people at home, there were plenty of yolk brunchers to be found here. the space, although industrial-looking, still felt warm and welcoming inside. and even though the restaurant looked completely full, almost every party was seated immediately upon arriving. i love no wait brunches! yolk's menu was a little overwhelming. they literally have everything - eggs, omelettes, frittatas, pancakes, waffles, crepes - you name it, they got it. i settled on the crepes combo as a compromise between a standard breakfast, and something a little more on the fancy side. everyone's food came out in a quick and orderly fashion. the sausage was a little on the cold side, but my crepes suzette made me forget about it quickly. they were heavenly. i also couldn't believe how big the portions were! normally, i'd have leftovers, but since everything tasted so good, i couldn't help myself - i quickly became a member of the clean plate club that morning. as for our waitress, she was courteous, and seemed to pop up at all the right times -- our coffees never got any less than half full. the prices were surprisingly reasonable too, especially considering the quality and size of the portions. if i'm in the neighborhood, i'd gladly come back!
