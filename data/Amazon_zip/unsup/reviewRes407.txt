i feel like its a culinary sin to not give this place a full 5 stars... but im giving it 4.5... i hope i don't get struck by lightening!! Alinea was amazing, the experience the service the people. The food was so mind blowing, you're constantly being surprised and confused and left scratching your head. So why -1/2 a star? Despite all its greatness, i just wasn't a huge fan of the food, the experience was amazing, but i just don't see myself ever craving something i ate there... and i feel like food no matter how complicated it is, should leave you dreaming about it tomorrow. One of the biggest biggest issues i had with my food was that it was WAY TOO SALTY. and i have an extreme salt tooth, i put salt on everything i add salt to salt and vinegar chips, so i can handle salt... and i couldn't handle some (most) of the dishes that were brought out. My friend felt the same way. Now unfortunately i don't know if it was just a mistake that day and someone slipped? or if that's just how it is.. but it made some things difficult to swallow. I loved that they gave us menu's after the dinner, i actually ended up leaving my menu somewhere, and when i called they were happy to send me a copy to my home. But they never did. =/ sad and lame. i absolutely recommend the experience and i hope the salt was just a fluke.
