This is my third visit and this time we took my parents, to avoid a wait we went late afternoon on a Sunday well after the lunch/brunch crowd had left. Three times and still not disappointed in the quality of the food and the service.  This time we ordered and all really enjoyed the Riccio di Mare e Granchio, pasta with large chunks of sweet crab meat. Another pasta dish that was outstanding was the Cacio e Pepe, pasta with the creaminess of the pecorino cheese followed with a kick from the black pepper. I like the casual decor, walls of wine storage, lots of brick, stone and wood and with a little imagination it resembles dining in a wine cellar in Umbria. I'm sure we'll be back again; it's just getting the timing down so we don't have to wait for 30/60 minutes.
