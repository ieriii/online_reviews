Very unique restaurant, serving all kinds of meat! It's a meat lovers delight! It was crowded for a weekday lunch hour, but still got seated within 20 mins, not bad. However, the minute we got seated, our server kept coming to us like within 5-10 mins asking if we had questions, etc. The first few times was like ok, great customer service, the few after that quickly turned into, ok we are fine! we will order food and ask more questions when we need to!!  Wish our party of 3 could have tried more food, but one of us was too full from alcohol the night before! So all we got to try was: Milk Braised Pork Shoulder with Mashed Potatoes - tasty! Two different kinds of cured meats - can't go wrong with thinly sliced salted ham! It's a fun place, but I need to definitely come back and try a whole lot more!
