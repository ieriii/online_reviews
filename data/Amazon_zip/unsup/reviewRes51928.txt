My first trip to Chicago involved a trip to UNO. I was with a friend from Chicago and this is the place he said we had to go to. The line was long, the booths were not much bigger than a shoebox, and the heat was terrible. The pie was good though. But it wasn't a pizza. Next I tried Gino's East. The atmosphere was so much better. We really enjoyed the roominess too. The pie was better than UNO. Still not a pizza though. More like a casserole full of pizza ingredients. I am glad to say that I have tried chicago style pizza. It's not something I would have to have each time I visit though. Nothing against Gino's East. If I were a big chicago style pizza eater, this would be the place I would eat at.
