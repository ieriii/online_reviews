I'm actually surprised this place has gotten such high reviews. I'm assuming most people must be new to the place otherwise they'd have noticed the significant decline in the quality of the food and service over the past few years. Considering this used to be a spot I frequented 2-3 days a week, it pains me to see such a great place starting to fall offThe food is different depending on what day you go and who the guys behind the counter are. Sometimes it's ok, other times it's just plain awful. Their falafels are made well but usually sit out under the lamps for god knows how long which, combined with the runny, bland, Jerusalem salad, results in a cold, wet/soggy sandwich.  These are NOT the same Sultan's falafel sandwiches I used to know and love. The lentil soup has a different consistency everytime I get it and unless you add a ton of lemon juice, it's pretty bland. The salad bar doesn't seem to get rotated with fresh vegetables regularly so by the time you come in for dinner, the lettuce is wilted, the veggies are all mixed together, etc...besides, with so many people lined up next to it on a daily basis, I'd rather not take my chances. On the upside, their egg & cheese fettia and spinach pie are both still pretty tasty, they have a pretty good selection of beverages, it's fast (sometimes to the point of being rushed), and their prices are cheap (although the people behind the register have been known to overcharge).
