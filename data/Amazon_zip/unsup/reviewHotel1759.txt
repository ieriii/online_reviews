We went to a wedding here recently, and the food and service were great. Later a few us went up and continued the festivities in a rather nice suite, complete with pool table and bar. My only gripe is with the Nazi doormen.. I understand the laws in Chicago about being 15-feet from the door when smoking, and not having an open container on the street, but you're not a cop, and you know there's a wedding going on. Quit taking out your frustration of having a crap-ass job on your guests. Other than that dickhead, the hotel was really nice.
