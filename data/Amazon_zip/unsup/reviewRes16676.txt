I came here on a Saturday night as the first stop for a friend's bachelorette party. I had been forewarned about the pretentiousness, but was kind of looking forward to it. We were looking for a swanky, exclusive bar to start our night out. We showed up around 9:15 pm and there was a line of about 15 people behind the curtain. They only allow as many people as there are chairs, but it seemed like the line was moving relatively quick. However, we didn't want to wait at all so we went up to the front to make an "appointment" to come back. We went to a nearby bar and the bouncer called us back in 20 minutes to say that he was ready. (you have 10 minutes to get back). We were seated in the back right near the fireplace which was pretty awesome. The drinks are listed according to the alcohol, which I loved. I ordered the Part & Parcel (Tito's, Grapefruit, St. Germain, Grapefruit Bitters) and it was absolutely delicious. Appetizers: we had the herb tots and the mini dogs...AMAZING. The mini dogs were especially delicious. Service: horrible. I understand that it takes awhile to make great cocktails, but 45 minutes? Come on. We wanted to order some apps after the drink order and she didn't return for another 30 minutes. I can totally dig the pretentious vibe, but the service better be damn good. Bathrooms: were totally filthy. I went to three different stalls and they all had toilet paper all over the floor. If this place wants to live up to its reputation it should start taking care of its facilities. In sum, the drinks were great. Food was great. Atmosphere fantastic. Service sucked. Bathroom disgusting.
