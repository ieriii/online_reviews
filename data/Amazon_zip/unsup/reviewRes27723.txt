What is the draw? Being Mexican, I had high hopes, especially after seeing it Check, Please! Eating on main floor, the ambiance was chaotic and without theme. Service was very neglectful. Had to ask for every dining essential twice (fork, get my own water, no "do you need anything' Never checked on our drink). All of which would have been irrelevant if the food was outstanding. But it wasn[t Guac was bland without discernible cilantro, tomato, onion, etc ; beams/rice were very basic; mole was standard issue, more chocolate sweet than smokey. I have to say the the harina (flour) tortillas were outstanding and clearly freshly homemade, The chips were great but the salsa was also bland. There was nothing about this place that exceeded what I can get in any Mexican neighborhood in the metro area. Some say this is very authentic and, if they are talking about Mexican food served in Mexican resort cities, I would have to agree. But, if you travel to regions like Oaxaca......now that's another story. Would not return unless I was in the immediate area.
