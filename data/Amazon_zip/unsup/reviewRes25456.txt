I read one review on Yelp that stuck out in my mind before I went to Geja's. It described the restaurant as a "dark velvety cavernous lair of love". I would like to elaborate that the dark velvetyness (stench of oil) lingers with you, long after you leave, and may be the perfect romantic impetus for you and your date to completely strip down and hop in the shower after dinner. .... oops TMI? Service was very attentive. Food was great. Lights were dim and romantic. The bf and I got a nice booth seat, away from the other people. My only "problem" with the restaurant was the number of kids there. (Yes, the website states "no children under the age of 10", but these kids must have been right-on-the-brink-of-10-years-old.) We happened to be next to two families, both with children. I really don't dislike children, but when they are super chatty, and dressed in sweatpants... well it kinda brings down the atmosphere just a tad.
