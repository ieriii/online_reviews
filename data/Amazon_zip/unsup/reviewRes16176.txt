Gorgeous atmosphere and great food.  I had the Ropa Vieja, braised beef on plantain. Absolutely delish. Sampled my dinnermates' seared ahi tuna and also the shrimp. All was excellent. I really don't like the tv's in the lounge, very distracting during dinner.  The bathrooms are beautiful. However, us ladies feel jipped. The guys said they had photos of naked girls in theirs. However, I do love that there are enough stalls here that you'll never be left waiting in line.
