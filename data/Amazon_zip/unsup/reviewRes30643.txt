We arrived at the restaurant a little before 5 and had to wait in the lounge area for about 10 minutes. Asked the hostess that we would like to sit at the sushi bar. However she took us to the corner of the sushi bar in the back. Unlike other sushi restaurants the seats at the sushi bar are very low and it blocks the view of the sushi chef.  Anyway, we ordered shishito peppers, a spicy "tail of two tunas" roll and a red dragon roll.  The shishito peppers were good.  The rolls did not have much flavor and the rice was not cooked properly. The service was good.  Glad that it was happy hour so we did not have to pay the full price.
