Go for the beer, go back for the food. I've been here 4 times in 2 months. As a person who throws a tantrum if they have to wait more than 15 minutes for a table and lives all the way northeast in Edgewater, that says a lot. I've yet to be blown away by any of the Revolution Brews but am sure it will happen soon. The Porter is pretty damn good. They have a good selection of guest beers and on my last visit they had quite a few cask beers.  The food is awesome. I'm a non-vegetarian that loves faux meat so I was super excited to find tofu and tempeh on the menu. You don't see tempeh often enough and that's just wrong. The Tempeh Rueben and Tofu Sandwich, yum. I would eat both all the time. I've tried various other dishes that my dining companions have ordered and have yet to try something that wasn't good. In addition to the vegetarian friendly dishes they have a lot of meat too. The ambiance is great. I love that much of the decorating uses beer barrels and other beer related items. I like to look around and think beer, beer, beer while I'm drinking beer. Who doesn't?  The only reason that I'm giving them 4 stars is that as a brewery they need to make at least one beer that makes me want to go back for the beer alone. Keep working. Hopefully soon I'll be able to increase to 5 stars.
