This could be the best slice of Pizza I ever had in my life, I got the one with everything and it was piping hot right out of the oven, be sure to ask for the feshest pie they have on display, I have gone when the slices are still good but not great as they sat under the lamps for a little too long. Now if we can get them to make a stuffed Pizza like Ians with the mac n cheese that would be one hell of a pizza. wish I had taken a picture of my beast, oh well the current pics here do Art justice.
