Am I easy to please? Maybe. Give me a decent selection of quality toppings, a decent crust, and the right amount of sauce and I'm a repeat customer. Piece hits the mark for me. Parmesan baked onto their red thin crust pizza is the best. (I haven't yet had the courage to try a real New Haven pie.) Good salads too. I only get take out from this place because the dining room is always packed and on a ridiculous wait. I've never even been to the front door of the restaurant (take out has a separate entrance) but it's so noisy I can't imagine enjoying the dining room. If I ever eat in and the experience is as bad I expect it to be maybe I'll come back and ding them a star. But for someone who solely gets take out from here, this is my current go-to thin crust pizza place in my part of the city.
