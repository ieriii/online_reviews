We tend to think of Spacca Napoli as an extension of our apartment, since we live right across the street from this beloved, neighborhood pizzeria and frequent it regularly with friends and family. Walking into Spacca is also about as familiar to us as walking into our own kitchen. Jonathan (the owner) is always as welcoming as an old friend and I don't think I have ever NOT been offered a complimentary appetizer or glass of Prosecco while waiting for a table on a busy night. In all honesty, our apartment's proximity to the restaurant was actually a selling point for us when we were looking to move to the neighborhood. That's how fond of Jonathan's establishment we are. I haven't tasted pizza like this since I studied abroad in Italy in college. Tasting Jonathan's pies for the first time was like taking a trip back in time to a place I hold very fondly in my heart! We love taking out-of-towners across the street for a delicious lunch or dinner and they always end up wanting to return the next time they are in for a visit (in fact, my friend from Portland was in town last weekend and she couldn't stop talking about what we would eat when we went to Spacca during her visit!). If there is ever a complaint about there being a line at this place, guess what? There's a reason why so many people want to eat here. It's worth the wait every SINGLE time!!!
