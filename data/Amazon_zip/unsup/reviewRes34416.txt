I was a bit late to discover this great brunch place - but everything here is yummy! They have the most extensive brunch menu that you can only imagine - it took me forever to decide what to eat and I ended up eating a bunch of stuff:) I had the frittata with avocado and bacon, which was amazing. Also - their pancakes are from another planet - I fell in love with chocolate and strawberry one at first sight (and bite). The decor makes you cheerful and happy - modern without being too ordinary. Grapefruit juice, which is a must for me, was delicious. And the prices are not crazy. Only caviat - you will have to wait for 30 minutes or so to get a table for Sunday brunch. But it's worth it!
