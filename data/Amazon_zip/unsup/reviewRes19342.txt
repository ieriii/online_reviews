Very good sushi. We had the tuna roll, the soft shell crab, various peices of sashimi and tuna. My boyfriend also had the miso soup and he loved it.  This place gets very crowded on the weekends so be prepared to wait. It also gets pretty loud. The server we had was very friendly and gave good recommendations. We decided to try one more sushi roll after eating the initial order...and it took forever to get it. Overall yummy!
