AHHHH! My boyfriend and I went to dinner with another couple to celebrate our friend's birthday. We had the most amazing dinner ever. I can't even believe how good the steak was. I'm drooling just thinking about it. Everyone ordered the filet and I've never had something so wonderful, juicy and tender. It was just pure steak heaven cooked to perfection. Crispy on the outside and juicy dark pink on the inside. Every bite was just as perfect as the last. Now I understand why it's so expensive. We all split a few sides and got a Broccoli au Gratin which was basically broccoli and cheese, we got mashed potatoes and potatoes au gratin. We ordered a BBQ shrimp appetizer that was served over the garlic mashed potatoes and it was all so freaking delicious! The service was wonderful. Our waiter addressed us by our name that was used for the reservation and he was perfectly attentive without being annoying. He was fun to talk with and he scored extra points by bringing us a chocolate cake with fudge and ice cream to celebrate our friend's birthday. I can't wait for an excuse to go back!
