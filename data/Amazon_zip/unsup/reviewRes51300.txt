No. This is not a good taco place. Although it is nice and the service is very prompt ( i do not know why there is so much chatter about rudeness and poor help...everyone was lovely and friendly) the food is not good. I am active with Old Town and am at Lincoln Square more than weekly--the food is just not very good, although cheap. Of note--the call top shelf liquor is $1-$3 less than many othe LS bars--to stop here for coktails and chips ahead of an Old Town event is not a bad idea.
