Went here during my visit to Chicago last week.  We went at around lunch time, and the wait about 45 mins long. We put down our name but we decided to walk around to find some snacks to hold out our hungry tummy for the feast.  We've returned to find that they had already called our party but we weren't there to claim. They didn't throw away our reservation and set up the table for us anyway. Our first time there, the waitress was super nice. She gave us suggestions on wine selections. We just had to try the Roasted Bone Marrow with Herbs and the Turkey Leg Confit, Crispy Lentils, Treviso, Endive & Agro Dolce. I don't remember what else we tried, but these two dishes were good. I was honestly a bit hesitant about the bone marrow because it just looked like a plate of fat. But it was served with bread pieces and wasn't too shabby.  We ended up purchasing a to go order of the turkey leg for our friends who weren't able to join us (everything else would just be too messy to carry). We ended up all sharing it for dinner. Heat it up and it tasted like we just ordered it.
