Stopped here for drinks after eating dinner and drinking a little at Hubbard Inn (not a bad plan as far as logistics - can easily walk from one to the other). Hubs and I have lived in Chicago for 7 years so we have pretty strong likes and dislikes, our own personal "best of" and "worst of" lists, etc. Lately we've been trying out new bars to see if anything can dethrone what we consider the Holy Trinity: Violet Hour, Sable, and Drawing Room. Well, no dethroning has yet occurred, but I did have a transcendent cocktail at Gilt Bar that was a great way to top off my night. It was called "10th Generation." It was incredibly complex, so amazing I was suppressing certain embarrassing facial expressions if you know what I mean =) Seriously, the combination of ingredients was brilliant: Nolet's gin, a pear liqueur (this was KEY), benedictine (thankfully not overpowering as often can be in mixed drinks), cucumber, and mint. Next time we're going to try Curio lounge in the basement, which I caught a glimpse of on the way to the ladies room. Oh, and the Doughnut Vault attached to GB, which sadly ran out of doughnuts the night we were there. They must be good!
