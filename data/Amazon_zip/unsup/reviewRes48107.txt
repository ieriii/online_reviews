Food is very good. Our party of three concentrated on the red meats and charcuterie. Everything we tried was delicious.  The service, after we were seated, was very attentive. The courses came in a well timed sequence until the last one, which was very late to the table. We were comped the course as a result. Were were seated at 8:30 after having arrived on time for an 8 PM reservation. The noise level in the restaurant was so high that conversation was almost impossible and we couldn't really carry on a conversation with the waiter. The inability to talk over the noise resulted in some confusion about our order. While the food was very good, the overall experience was such that I don't think I'll go back again.
