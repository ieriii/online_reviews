Meat free at its finest. I have been here many times and am seldom disappointed. There is a vast menu that should appease whatever your taste is for. I would normally recommend some of their original creations over the meat substitute dishes. This is also a great place to spend Thanksgiving. The tofurkey is outstanding and rivals any actual turkey dinner I've ever had.
