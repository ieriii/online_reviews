Opart Thai is a good restaurant. But that's as much as a I can say. Food tasted good, but was nothing special. Prices were fine, but usually at Thai places you get a lot of food. Here that wasn't the case. It was just enough food, but not enough that I'd get to take some home too. Friendly waitstaff and we had no issues, but I woudn't go out of my way to come here again.
