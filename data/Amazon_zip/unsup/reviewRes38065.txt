During my recent visit to Chicago, I had to try the famous Giordano's deep dish stuffed pizza. WOW! I was very impressed. My friends and I split the medium stuffed pizza, which the waitress said feeds 2-3 people...more like 6 people! I could only eat one slice, but my goodness was that slice amazing!!!! I highly recommend this place for anyone who wants legit Chicago style pizza.
