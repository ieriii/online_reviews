I get excited reading the Chicago Diner menu, There are just enough choices to satisfy most of my food moods, without being overwhelming. Some of the things I enjoy most: mac and cheese (go for the dairy if you eat dairy), Radical Reuben, and Temptation ice cream shakes (chocolate peanut butter is my favorite). Planing to try the Southern Style next time I go. Friendly, accommodating, and attentive staff overall. The back patio is great, just odd having to walk through the kitchen to get there. Sometimes I leave underwhelmed (I wasn't a fan of the Soul Bowl because its ingredients were all on the dry side, and I realize I could easily make the shakes at home if I wanted to), and the prices are a little higher than I'd normally spend on a casual lunch. Also wish they had preservative-free Sriracha. But the Chicago Diner is a fun place to go every once in a while, and I recommend it to vegans and non-vegans alike.
