I think I lucked out on this place. I got a room here via bidding on Priceline for like $80 for a Wednesday night in January. I had a great experience. Upon arrival the front desk lady was really friendly and was able to grant my wish of a room on a high floor (34th) looking out towards the lake. The view was amazing. The room was huge. The bathroom AREA was separate from the rest of the room. When I say area, there was a power area with its own mirror and bench, the actual bathroom which had a tub, a very nice stand alone marble shower, the sink area, and then the toilet had its own little closet within the actual bathroom. It was a little weird that there was no tank on the toilet and had a flushing system similar to what you would find in a stadium. This was really my only gripe. Besides that, everything was very nice. The TV was a 42" flat screen. The bed was super soft with very nice pillows. There was a couch area with its own coffee table. There was a desk area as well. There was a nicely stocked mini bar, with about anything or any alcohol you could ever want. However, I'm sure everything in it was really expensive, i couldn't tell you for sure because there wasn't a price sheet, which was a bummer. If you need to use the Internet, be prepared to open your wallet cause it was $15 and some change per day for Internet. That too was a bummer. All in ll the place was great. I even used to concierge to book dinner at a top Italian restaurant before catching a show at Second City. This place was a great hotel and I would totally stay here again.
