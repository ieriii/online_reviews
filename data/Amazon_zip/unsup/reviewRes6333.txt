This is a restaurant whose reputation puzzles me.  The food is average, the service was totally overblown with kitchy bs anecdotes and my filet was so tough that I could not eat it. However, if you like being surrounded by fresh out of college greek types whose parents are in town for the weekend from suburban Dallas, then it is your place.
