This is one of my favorite spots in Chicago. Before I moved here my wife and I were up for a weekend. We walked into this place for dinner. We loved the atmosphere, the food and the experience. This was long before we had a kid but one of the first things we noticed was it is very kid friendly. I have yet to have anything that I am not a fan of. Good food done well.
