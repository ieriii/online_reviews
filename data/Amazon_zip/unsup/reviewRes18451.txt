A really cool thing about this place is the art work. I spent the majority of the time looking at the paintings and wishing I could buy one (they are for sale). The food was gamazing and the staff was very friendly and accommodating. The bruschetta was packed with flavor and I had a sea food pasta dish that was delish.
