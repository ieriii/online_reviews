I really enjoyed our experience at Gejas. We got seated promptly. Though we were very close to the couple next to us. The food was great, the wine was fabulous (wish I could remember the name!), and I left full and happy. We had the platter with every meat option, and I couldn't pick a favorite, maybe the beef or shrimp (they were huge). I even liked the chicken which I'm not a big fan of.  Like someone else said, I wouldn't rush back but next time I would probably just stick to the cheese and chocolate. Mmm mmm good!
