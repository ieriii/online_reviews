My favorite lunch spot in Chicago. I've tried most of all of the menu so far. The Ahogada: Golden pork carnitas, black beans, tomato broth, spicy arbol chile sauce, pickled onions. Is my favorite without a doubt. Warning, getting it spicy is extremely spicy. Churros dipped in the Aztec coffee is a great finish to the meal. I also had the parfait which was delicious. Note- There's usually a line but depending on what time you get there it moves relatively fast. Ordering beers kills the time as well.
