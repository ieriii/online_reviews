Their margherita-style pizza was absolutely delicious. Thin and crispy all the way through and toppings were plentiful and flavorful without soggifying the crust. Myself and two female coworkers thought we wouldn't be able to finish a large when we saw it come out. We were wrong. They are also a talented brewery as well, with quite a few award-winning beers. Nice daily specials. If I were local I'd have to take advantage of their weekly $25 large pie and a growler deal. We were fortunate to have been seated right away. The next party after us had to wait a while. Parking was a pain, but that was about the only fault I could find.
