Mia Francesca is cute neighborhood spot with good food, fairly friendly service, and fun ambiance. The back patio is very romantic and just a great experience overall (have sat out there on previous occasions). The only complaint we had was that the dining room was a bit loud and made conversation difficult at times (although it gave the restaurant an energetic feel).
