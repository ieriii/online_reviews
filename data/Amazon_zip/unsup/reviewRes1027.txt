Hot Doug's never disappoints. Bought five different dogs to take to San Francisco to intro them to my family. When I asked Doug what dogs travel best, he replied, "Sausages are made to travel." He was right. Even after the flight from Chicago, we warmed three of the dogs and they were fantastic. Next day, we warmed the other two. Still excellent. My family now requires me to bring dogs to SF any time I come. Sausage time has been born. I would recommend any of the game of the week or specials. While everyone loves the duck fat fries, I prefer the tater tots. Light and crispy and oh so delicious. If they have the crayfish sausage, do not hesitate--best sausage I've ever had.
