Absolutely love it! A few weeks ago, my partner and I were on our way to another Cuban Cafe, but our waiter told us try us out. So we did, and wow. Absolutely awesome. So tonight we invited friends and had the most pleasurable time there. We brought in our liquor and they created a "Mojito" mix for us. Unfortunately we thought (due to face-book) that Mojitos were free for first pitcher, but alas, we were told that only from Sundays through Thursdays. Didn't affect our night, we had a wonderful time eating the comfort foods for Cuba, We all had different house specials and really enjoyed it all. I am an avid fan of critiquing restaurants and I will say, 90 miles is definitely on the rise. Food is SUPER authentic, but of course with a tiny twist. The waiter of the night (Aldo) who happened to have been waiting tables for what 2 hours???, was so knowledgeable on the food, and he really let us know what he liked, which is a plus for a waiter because if he likes it, we had to of liked it. And yes, that was the case, He was just really attentive, as are most of the waiters, and that is very much appreciated. The red snapper was really good, the ox tails, did fall off the bone, the rest was just perfect. I will give them 4 stars because there is always room for improvement, but lI can appreciate a mom and pop tasting place for sure. Try them out, trust me, you will not be disappointed and definitely eat in the HEATED PATIO, What a kick! You guys are definitely up and coming and you know what you're doing for sure. The cooks? WOW, They definitely know the taste of Cuba!
