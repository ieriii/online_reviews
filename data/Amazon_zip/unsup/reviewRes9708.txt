I was reminded to try this place when I saw a recent episode of Windy City Live and Sprout's chef Dale Levinski (sp) was featured. He did a Sunday brunch item of a French Toast that was infused with papaya, mango etc.. .instead of syrup. It looked good and I like adventures to an extent, so I gave it a try. I must warn, they have no standard dishes - the names are all in "quotes" such as "omelet" or "French toast" etc.. I had the "omelet" which had shrimp, scallops and giardinara (not excessive) and marscapone cheese.. nothing I would ever attempt to make myself, but it was good. (And pricey at $17)  Honestly, this place is only recommended for people who watch Top Chef, hear a bunch of ingredients blended together that they have never experienced before and sit back waiting for an adventure. In the case of my dish, it succeeded. My dining companion wasn't as wild about his ham "croquet" .. but would come back to try the French Toast (a steal at only $10), which just about everyone around us ordered. Another disappointment was the Bacon Bread side.. they gave us 3 of them and the bacon inside was cold on one of them.. so a point off for inconsistency.. also, not enough bacon and too much bread.. so I can't recommend. Our drinks were some kind of fruity mimosa.. can't remember exactly the name because the server recommended it but it was red and outstanding. Service was beyond outstanding.. I'd come back just to see John again... who was friendly and attentive.  We will return, but perhaps rely more on John to steer away from the clinkers...
