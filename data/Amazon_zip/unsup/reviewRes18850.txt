Corporate Coffee Chain meets Fine Dining Fare. They get married, shoot out a kid and name him Xoco. COOLNESS FACTORS --The breakfast food is phenomenal. Chorizo torta? Yes please. Wood-over chilaquiles? Two please. Churros? I'll take a dozen to go. --The coffee is the best in Chicago. Served is French presses, it's super-fresh and simply amazing. --Saturday morning breakfast around 9:30 am = not so busy. Waited in line 5 minutes, seated immediately. QUESTIONABLE FACTORS --If you're eating in, the hostess will assign you a seat as you walk in the door, before you get in line to order. It's a number, however, the tables and bars aren't numbered. So it was unclear how to find our table. But I'm gifted in the brains department, so I figured out I could ask a Xoco employee. Yep, that worked. Seated! That said, even some of the servers don't have the whole "invisible numbered" tables thing down. Twice they tried to serve us food that belonged to a different table. --You pay at the counter, like you do when you buy coffee at Starbucks. That's cool. However, when you sign your credit card receipt, there is a line for "tip," and the person taking your order is staring you down as you sign the slip. Leave a good tip or risk the evil eye. (My husband also thinks you're risking a spitter, however, I believe Xoco is way too classy for that.) OVERALL: Excellent coffee, great food, interesting experience, good time. Will be back to update when I go for lunch!
