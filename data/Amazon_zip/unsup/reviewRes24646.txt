Was not impressed in the least bit. We came here because I had a http://restaurant.com coupon for my boyfriends birthday. We were both extremely excited because we'd read all of these great reviews. Turns out... not so much. This place does NOT blow melting pot out of the water. After reading the reviews I was expecting Geja's to at least match the impressiveness of Melting pot.  First of all, my boyfriend ordered a beer which was $7 (for a goose island 312 beer that is way too much). The cheese fondue was OK but not spectacular, and the items to dip in the cheese were strange/not fresh.  The meat fondue tasted great, it was a little irritating to have to keep track of everything without a stop watch (sea food takes one minute, chicken takes 3 minutes, steak takes 1 minute 45 seconds, etc) all in the middle of dinner conversation, but I guess that is to be expected at a fondue place. The chocolate fondue was what honestly what I was looking forward to all night because I'm the most chocolate obsessed person in the world. However, the consistency was way to thin & almost like "tangy" tasting. I didn't even finish the dessert items because the chocolate was so dissatisfactory. Geja's should be taking notes from the melting pot on their chocolate fondue.  The only good things about this dinner was the romantic atmosphere/live music and the hazelnut dessert coffee at the end of the meal. Even after our discount was applied, I still had to pay $140, which was probably the worst part of all.
