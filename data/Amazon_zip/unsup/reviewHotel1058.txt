Oh this place is fucking bullshit! Check out their website then imagine the opposite...everything is stained old dirty falling apart, the cable barely works, no fridge in the room, and "breakfast" is coffee and donuts, i'm not a cop goddammit, at least throw me some toast. Rude staff (although I prolly wouldn't be nice if I worked in that shithole either). I have been to about 35 countries and 40+ states, NEVER NEVER NEVER anything this bad or misleading, not even the 29.99 roadside places in the middle of Kansas...oh and this morning there's not even any donuts OMFG OMFG
