We arrived at our Hotel, put our stuff up and walked over to the Purple Pig...our group had no problems getting a table, but we did have to share it with 2 other people. This wasn't a big deal to me but might be to others. I think we ordered everything on the menu, or it seemed that way since food just kept coming out. We ordered the pig platter and it had EVERYTHING on it! My favorite thing was the pigs ear with kale and the turkey leg (the meat pretty much falls off the bone. Everything else was good. They have a nice list of beers to choose from and lots of wines. I would go back to try a few more things I did not get to order.
