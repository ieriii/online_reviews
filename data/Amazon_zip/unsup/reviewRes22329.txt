I thought Lao Sze Chuan was a great experience--it was my first time eating in Chinatown! So I guess take that for what it's worth--I eat tons of Chinese food, but random places in my neighborhood (Andersonville) and I do eat at corporate places like PF Changs. But with that said....I grew up on south indian food, so I am not completely unfamiliar with authentic asian cuisines. We got here about 6:00 on a Saturday night-we got a number at the door, and the line moved pretty quickly. We sat down and ordered our appetizer (eggrolls-amazing) and got water and tea (also good). The waitress gave us a complimentary appetizer of spicy cabbage, which it appears is the standard. It is very good, but VERY spicy. Like your lips feel like they are burning off spicy. I'm part Indian, so I tried to fight through it and eat it all.  Then came time to order our dinner. Per yelp reviews, we chose the chili chicken. My husband also picked a cashew chicken. The cashew chicken was excellent--very tasty, great sauce, yummy mushrooms with it, etc. The chili chicken was just okay I guess--we left about half of it on the table.  Service seems to be similar to others'. Our waitress took our order and then we never saw her again. BUT, we were taken care of by others working in the restaurant, so I guess whatever works.  I would definitely recommend this place-the food was good and it's a unique experience. I did not give it a 5 because I think I need to give it another try and try a different meal, and not OD on the spicy cabbage! I also need to see what the difference (besides the location, clientele, and atmosphere) is from this restaurant, and others I have been to throughout the city.
