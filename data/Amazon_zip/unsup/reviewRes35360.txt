We went to Shaws before seeing the Homer/Hopper exhibit. What was supposed to be an inexpensive afternoon got pricey real quick but it was certainly enjoyed. We sat in the bar area where I prefer for lunch to occur. Dinner in that dinning room is much different and you should try both. I had 1/2 doz chefs choice oysters which were excellent. The only place I have had better is in Seattle. Sorry East Coasters...I like the West Coast. My partner had the seafood gumbo that he really enjoyed. Now for the kicker...we both ordered the 1.5lb of King Crab legs. They were huge but very tasty and fresh. For $48.00 each they should have been HAHA.  2 aps, 2 entrees,1 side of fries, 3 beers=$200 including tip. Shaws isn't a place we go as regulars but they have a decent beer selection for an afternoon of seafood. Very enjoyable
