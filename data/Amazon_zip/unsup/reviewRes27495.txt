This is simply the best pizza anywhere. Their pan pizza really defies classification--to call it "Chicago Style" pizza does it a disservice: It is no three-inch thick slab of overwhelming cheesyness topped with an anemic tomato paste. No. It is a superb bread to cheese to sauce ratio. And there has been though put into how everything tastes. The bread compliments the cheese taste which compliments the well-spiced sauce. Many people have mentioned the caramelized crust, and it's just about perfect. I'm honestly less enamored with the thin crust pizza, but I'm not sure why anyone would come to Pequod's and get the thin crust pizza... I feel the same way about the appetizers, but, again, if you're ruining your appetite for pizza on the appetizers that's, like, your choice, man. There is a pretty decent beer selection, and the service is fine. Pequod's is very busy on weekend nights, so expect to wait a little while if you don't have a reservation.
