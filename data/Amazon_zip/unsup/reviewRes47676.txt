While the rooftop at Zed451 is top notch, the overall experience fell short. I was meeting co-workers for a going away happy hour; they had already arrived and secured spots on the rooftop. When I arrived, a staff member told me that I couldn't go up to the rooftop b/c it was too crowded; no one else was in line and I was able to talk my way up. Imagine my surprise when I found a rooftop that was not filled with hundreds of people (really, this was crowded??).  I settled in for nice conversation and a $10 glass of sangria that was just alright. Our waitress was quite nice and very apologetic at the very long wait times between the drink order and drink delivery. I didn't try the food but others said the appetizers were good. Overall I had a nice time because of the company I was with but I doubt that I'll head back anytime soon...just too pricey and you wait so long for service.
