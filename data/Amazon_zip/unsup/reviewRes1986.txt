While in Chicago, I only tried Hot Dogs here, and at a Cubs Game. Both were great in comparison to hot dogs the rest of America is used to.. But Hot Dougs was amazing! Cute, relaxed little restaurant, of course the only negative is the long line, but what do you expect this place has +1,000 reviews! but once you order, the food is super fast and delicious! I would definitely go to Hot Dougs If I am in Chicago again
