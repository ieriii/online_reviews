Talk about OVER RATED! The food was good, the staff, for the most part is so stuck up and they want to turn those tables FAST. It is very expensive for what you get. The hostess was so unkind! AManda out waitress was a total sweet heart!I like the communal table setting, fun and met some fun people, it is so loud you can't really have a good conversation with your friends on the other side of the table.As they bring your small plates they just slam it down on the table and in front of one of the people in your party and quickly mumble what it is. The pace is so frenetic it is not a place to go and and enjoy yourself and spend any quality time. I am sure this atmosphere is created that way so you get in, eat and get out so they can flip the tables. It is way over priced for the food and the amount that you get.If I ever go again, it will be too soon. $400.00 for dinner?? There are a ton of amazing places in Chicago to spend that kind of money.
