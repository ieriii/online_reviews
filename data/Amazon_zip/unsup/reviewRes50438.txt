2 star rating?! Maybe it was my high expectations. Or maybe it was because I went for dinner instead of going for breakfast or brunch, which is what Wishbone is known for.  Nah. It was the meh food. I was so excited when my friend suggested we check out Wishbone. It got pretty good reviews on Yelp and I've always wanted to try Southern food. I started off with the seafood gumbo. That wasn't bad. It was the most flavorful part of the dinner. For the entree I had the blackened catfish. It was blackened with Cajun spices but it had zero flavor. The texture of the catfish was so rubbery I could barely cut it. The Cajun fries had the opposite issue. Someone in the kitchen was very generous with the chilli powder seasoning on the fries. After I got over the overpowering flavor, I did notice they had a good crispiness to them. For dessert, we had the bread pudding. Cinnamon and caramel. It was massive and it was good.     The service was good. The waitress was nice and the food was served in a timely manner. I might give Wishbone another try but this time for the brunch.
