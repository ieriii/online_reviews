I began frequenting Grand Lux way back in college when my best friend and I would skip our courses for 4 courses (of food) and shopping. First of all, the restaurant decor is like stepping into a Gustav Klimt painting sans cloistered erotic vibe. It is definitely one of the reasons I love visiting. The two-seater booths near the windows are also a great feature. In other restaurants couples are forced to eat at tables, which are wedged in the corner or which have prime access to the loo. Here, couples can rejoice! They have dibs on a Michigan Avenue view. Although I feel the food is really upscale fast food, it does hit the spot when you are craving something scandalous to your diet. I usually order the potato rolls and the spinach dip, both of which are notoriously yummy. I also love their desserts and martinis. Unfortunately, the wait is usually unbearable and you are forced to interact with...*gasp*... tourists. You will recognize them because they are carrying American Girl purchases and have bags of Garretts popcorn. Avoid them at all costs, as they are dangerously annoying.
