As this was my first time in Chicago, of course a must try is deep dish pizza. This was our second stop after Lou Malnalti's. First of all, the service was horrible as the server never came to check on us and was nowhere to be found. The pizza also took about 50 mins so we were even more irriated. As for the pizza: Doesn't beat Lou Malnati's! It was too much cheese, the dough wasnt buttery. Bottom line: I wasnt feeling this place
