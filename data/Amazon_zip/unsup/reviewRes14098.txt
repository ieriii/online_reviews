Being from Miami and now living in Chicago - when I heard about this restaurant I couldn't wait to try it out in hopes of getting the real deal. 90 Miles delivers in a big way.  Excellent food here. A lot of the traditional choices. Fast, courteous and cheap! Too bad there's no tres leches, but you can't have everything.
