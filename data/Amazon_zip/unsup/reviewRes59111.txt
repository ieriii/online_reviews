LOVE this place. Have never had a bad breakfast here. Service is friendly, efficient and very quick. Food is consistently excellent. Personal favorite is the Orange Bread French Toast, but there are plenty of choices to suit any palate. The coffee is just okay -- could be a better bean and cups could be bigger. Be prepared for a considerable wait during prime-time weekend mornings because this is obviously a popular neighborhood restaurant.
