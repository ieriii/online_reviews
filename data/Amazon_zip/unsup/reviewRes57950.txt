I drove past this restaurant on a Saturday, and decided to go back with some people for dinner that same night. I had a great time. We had drinks, and appetizers.. the polenta is awesome. Then we ordered dinner, steak and goulash. The goulash is the BEST! I can't wait to come back. The owner stoped at our table, and even picked me and my girlfriend up out of our chairs to dance to the band that was playing. If you don't like dancing, you can watch the rest dance which proved to be quite entertaining. Try it out! I can't wait to go back.
