I likey. But I have only been once, so who knows. I loved the burgers, those were scrum-tastic. And the beer was also delicious. And it was a nice vibe in the place, good acoustics, good work work, a little hipster meets a yuppie. Which is where this hood is going. So I want to go back and experience more.
