When one of our friends came into town and stayed here we decided to take high tea. This was AMAZING. It was roughly $34 per person, and this included finger sandwichs (which were delicious), pasteries, dessert, and of course as much tea as you can drink. They have many choices, some of which are really exotic. A great place to spend the afternoon with friends.
