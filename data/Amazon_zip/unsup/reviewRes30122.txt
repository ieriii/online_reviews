This place gets packed and loud early on but it's fun. The bowl of rock shrimp is the kind of thing I'm going to wish I was always eating late at night. So much flavor and I just fell in love with it from the first bite. The crispy pata we had was crispy and juicy inside and very filling. I would recommend sharing the dishes like we did because there is a lot of food in one serving. The lamb with the miso crust was perfectly cooked. The only thing that fell flat for me was the saketini. It just tasted like cucumber vodka and I didn't really enjoy it. The Grass Tiger was a much better cocktail and a lot more fun to drink. The jalapeno in it gave it great spice and the ginger and lemongrass made it really refreshing. Service was very good. The manager/owner? spoke to us twice to see if we were enjoying everything and we really appreciated that.
