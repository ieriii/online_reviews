Rick Bayless. The name is Chicago glory. Winning Top Chef Masters is like winning Art Prize, Bushido and the Chicago Marathon all in the same year. So, yeah, he's decent at his craft.Of Course everyone is raving about the churros and hot chocolate (I had the Barcelona-- if you know me you know there's a strange obsession there.)The couple together is like animalistic coitus of the mouth. I got jabbed in the ribs for moaning.The only problem here is that the tortas (okay these are really kinda like fancy, delicious versions of a toasted sub) are a bit pricey for what you get -- but there is the fact that you get free filtered sparkling water from a tap! How rad is that... I fucking love that shit!! I had the torta with suckling pig. Of course it was good, but was it $12 good... i guess relative to what/whom is the question. The habanero sauce it came with was addictive in it's mouth numbing properties, but it totally outmatched the sandwich and that fact surprised me since it's from flavor perfectionist Bayless.I'll be back for sure. After all they were not serving the head cheese torta when I went.
