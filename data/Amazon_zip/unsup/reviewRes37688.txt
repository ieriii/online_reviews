I live near Fox and Obel and usually stop in for the sushi (some of the freshest in the city!) or prepared goods. They also sell a lot of hard to find items and their freezer meals section is extensive. I would not do my weekly shopping here because the bill would be huge, but if you are in the neighborhood and are a foodie, definitely check out Fox and Obel. Also, they have cafe with some amazing food! However, I once went there for breakfast when Yolk was full and the service was some of the worse in my life. Slow and ran out of cups! However the truffle Parmesan fries, pancakes and omelet my friends and I shared were delicious!
