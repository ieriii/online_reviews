OH! How have I not reviewed this place yet? I have been here several times now since their open mid-last year and I really, really like this place. I love their beers (the hoppier makes Erin the happier), the pulled pork and jalapeno-honey slaw is TO DIE FOR and they even sport a pretty decent cheese plate! What's not to love? I even like the local art on the walls and the cool blown beer bottle installation above the front foor. The only thing that didn't wow me was the bacon-sage popcorn. Much too smokey-bacony and the popcorn kinda felt a touch stale, but maybe that was what they were going for. Le shrug...pass me another beer! In all, this is a great addition to my little corner of El Logan and I'm happy to bring all my visitors here.
