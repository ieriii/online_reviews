I'm not normally a Yelp reviewer, but my experience here last night was SO AWFUL that I just had to comment... I heard about this bar years ago when I moved to Chicago, and finally went for the 1st time last night. We had a group of 6, not too big at all. We waited about 20 minutes to get booth - No problem! However, once we sat down, everything was downhill from there.  The service was absolutely awful. We were treated like we were the hugest inconvenience to our server(s), and were lucky if we got ANYTHING out of her besides a nasty glare. It was our girls night out, and we were about 1 drink in, so we were in no way being drunk or absurd.  3 of the girls in our party have all worked as bartenders and servers, and are extremely understanding that people get busy, and sometimes you can't be as attentive as you'd like, but our server was flat out rude. Rolling her eyes, just grabbing her money, throwing down the bill without saying anything... ? Perhaps the service industry just isn't for her...
