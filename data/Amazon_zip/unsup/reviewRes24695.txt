This place was good. Tried some empanadas and garlic tostones/plantains. The empanadas were decent, but my tostones were way, WAY too garlicky (and by the way, I love my garlic!). Otherwise, the menu seemed to have a very good selection and the outdoor patio seating was a plus. Also, make sure you bring cash, this place does not except credit/debit.
