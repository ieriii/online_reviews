The food was okay but the potential for people watching was fantastic.  I had the red pepper raviloi and was a little disappointed but the nachos that my table ordered were tasty.  I hear fantastic things about their vegan milkshakes but with 12 degree weather, I did not have a chance to check those out. I'd honestly give this 3.5 stars on the basis that they have an affordable wine list, great people watching, and soy cheese.
