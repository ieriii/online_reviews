Didn't get to experience the rooftop this past Saturday because it was closed due to rain. We hung out in the lounge on the first floor, right in front of the wall-to-wall TV screen. I appreciated the atmosphere - candlelit & cozy. We were there having a few drinks before going out for my friend's birthday. I had a cranberry tequila Cosmo (or something like that) & it was ok...Without the sugar rim I probably wouldn't have finished it. Everyone was super nice & helpful, from the hostess to our server. I definitely plan to go back & actually eat something next time.
