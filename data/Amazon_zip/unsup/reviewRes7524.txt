Came here with some friends and really enjoyed our night out. Entrees included Salmon, Brisket and St. Louis Style ribs. We all shared a bite and I thought everything tasted very good. Like previous reviewers, we ordered the mac&cheese and thought it was delicious. We had onion rings to start, they were alright. The batter is quite thick so the onion isn't cooked as much as I prefer. Service was just ok. Not good but not bad. The interior is beautiful. Hopefully I'll be able to live in a house that looks like this some day!
