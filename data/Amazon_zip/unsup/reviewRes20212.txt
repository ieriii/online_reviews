I chose Coast for Valentine's Day dinner with my wife based on Yelp reviews. She's beautiful and amazing and deserves the best. Coast is not the best.  Service was extremely slow, the dining room so dark and loud we could barely see or hear each other. This was not helped by the fact that the tables were REALLY crammed together. I seriously think there wasn't much more than 8-10" between us the next diners on both sides. Their conversations, their complaints about the service, were practically on top of ours. The valet was also slow, and very haphazardly organized. As for the sushi, it should be said that one of the stars I'm awarding is for the White Dragon roll alone. I'd order it for carryout again if I had any inclination to give this place any more of my money. Which I don't at this point. Outside of that, the other three maki we had were inoffensive, and passable, but certainly not exceptional. Maki done well should have a variety of textures and flavors, and most of ours were one note, sometimes even a little mushy. We also sampled a special appetizer (the name of which escapes me now: it was a piece of fish wrapped in fish with a little fritter) which was outright unpleasant, with a strong briny bite and that fish "stink" you associate with old or cheap cuts of fish. Considering we paid, $11 for two bites, it was the biggest disappointment of the night. I had hoped Coast would give us an "upscale" sushi experience. I was looking forward to really treating the both of us and sharing our love of the cuisine, even prepared to spend triple digits. As it was, we couldn't wait to get out of there and move the evening someplace else.
