THE place to go for hot dogs here in Chicago. Whenever my non-Chicago friends come into town, this is where I take them. Prices are a little steep for a hot dog, but just like other good restaurants, you're paying for the experience too. It's definitely a one-of-a-kind location and hot dog as well. I hear they're opening up another location, but part of me hopes they don't. I'd hate for it to run into the problems some of the Portillo's have now that it's a chain. Great hot dogs (and everything else on the menu for that matter), cool place to hang out on summer nights, and you gotta love the two winking hot dogs on top of the building.
