I've been here three times -- and each time the food, beer and service have been excellent. The crowds are beginning to lessen and all their beers seem to be consistently available now.  What a great addition to the neighborhood and to Chicago. Let's hope the initial popular reception indicates that the city has plenty more room for brewpubs that craft their food as meticulously as their beer (yeah, that's a shot at you, Goose). Since I'm vegetarian, I really appreciate Revolution's many options. I love Hopleaf too -- but I'm can't make it a regular dining spot because I have only one choice on their menu.  The sweet potato cakes are a great starter here. The bruschetta was enjoyable too, although a couple of them were a bit soggy (but still tasty). The Tempeh Reuben, which my partner had (not my style), could have used more dressing (which they were happy to bring to the table) -- but the bread was fresh and chewy and the thinly sliced tempeh was flavored just right. The pizzas are surprisingly superb, considering how picky I am about my pizza. They are artisan-style -- and have many great veggie options. The freshly-baked crust is key -- but the sauce, cheese and generous veggies (both the mushroom and arugula) were pitch-perfect in flavor and proportion. All their bread is homemade, on site -- and it's done by someone who really knows her or his stuff. It's really good. My only suggestion here would be to add more 100% whole-grain options (for health and taste reasons). Since they are making it themselves, it seems like it might be easier to offer as an option. As far as their homemade beer, it's growing on me. My expectations are high, I should point out.  The Anti-Hero IPA is the only one that really grabs me -- a nice complete taste, good hops. I guess I'd like them to try something in the Belgian-style or something with more unique flavor. The Willy and the Stout work, but they are a bit mild for my tastes. The decor is as unique as the rest of the place.
