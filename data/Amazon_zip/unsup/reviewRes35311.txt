The barbeque duck here is straight up... phenomenal. It's a meal, essentially - recommendation to preorder with a reservation. From one duck, you get duck fried rice, duck soup, and bbq duck sandwich type things. Order a few sides of veggies? And life. is. good. Totally reasonable in price. Totally yummy. Service is so-so, but it's not meant to be a gourmet restaurant, and it's why you're not paying gourmet prices.  Also you don't have to go as south of Chinatown for some great food. Don't forget to make the reso/pre-order. And bring friends! I believe one duck serves about 4? But ask when you call. Enjoy :)
