I stopped here for lunch after taking a half day from work.. I ordered the Ropa Vieja.. It was pretty good, nothing off the charts.. I'd definitely go back to try something else.. funny story - I kept staring at the cashier because he looked so familiar and couldnt figure out where i have seen him before.. I'm sure he thinks im a crazy person
