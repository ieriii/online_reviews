Great place to go if you want organic, fresh squeezed juices, and a balanced meal. This isn't your hang over greasy breakfast place :) I'm a fan because the options for juices are great, and the ingredients are fresh. I'm not a fan of the long 30 min- 1 hour wait as it's a very small place. The portions are great for your date ( girl) for the price, but i would never come here with a hang over and bring the guys. Just not that type of environment :)
