quality food- fresh and abundant and worth what you pay for just because they throw-in so much shrimp or beef to the dishes.. the taste and presentation isn't all that great though. you would expect so much more from it just by looking at the cute rush street setting. the vietnamese and french colonial motive is very trendy. romantic.
