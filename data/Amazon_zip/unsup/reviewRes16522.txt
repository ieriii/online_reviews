Darkly moody, brooding, classy, vintage. This place is all access to class!! No other lounge has left such an impression on myself than this. If you are lucky enough to first, find this venue and secondly get it without waiting nearly an hour an half outside. If patience is one of your virtues, and your lucky enough to get picked inside then you'll find yourself amongst a swank interior with very intimate blue booths placed along the walls and thick velvet curtains to keep the intimacy. Waitstaff is immediately attentive to serve and inform on the night's choice for drinking. Each drink is brought to life by some amazing bartender behind the scene. My immediate pick was the Juliet and Romeo. It was delicious simple (Gin tonic and mint) muddled and sweet! Each our group's drinks looked and tasted SUBLIME!! Even the trip to the bathroom is worth walking through the all the glossy high-backed chairs and candlelit fireplace. Biggest plus is that they are clean and co-ed. When in Chicago make sure to put The Violet Hour in your book! Absolutely a must!!
