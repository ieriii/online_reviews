I'm just going to say it as absolutely simple as possible: one of Doug's hot dogs almost made me cry at first bite. It was so, so, so good. I can't remember the name but it was the pork & shrimp sausage with the gouda cheese, almonds, and creme fraische on top. Yes, it is a long wait, and yes it is worth it. Yes it's in the middle of nowhere, but that's the only thing keeping the lines barely manageable. I've stood outside in the middle of December and haven't been disappointed.  I like the fact that Doug is the guy who takes your order. I like the fact that everyone who works there seems to be pretty down to earth. Any negatives? I think the duck fat fries are good, but a tad overrated.
