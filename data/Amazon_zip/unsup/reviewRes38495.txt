I love this place. It's so cozy and everything that's great about a pub. I was in this place on a Monday night and even then it was pretty crowded. I ordered the Sierra seasonal Ale and another seasonal ale on tap. They were both delicious. I split two sandwiches and all I have to say is that pb&j sammie is deadly! The best combination of flavors. I will for sure being going back to this place time and time again!
