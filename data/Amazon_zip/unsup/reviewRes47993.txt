A great restaurant is sometimes made by how well they deal with their mistakes. We ordered and 40 minutes later we still didn't have our appetizer. I asked what went wrong (my best guess is that our waitress forgot to put in our order) and although she did not offer an answer, she immediately corrected the problem by paying for our appetizer. The whole staff was extremely helpful after that.  The food was excellent.
