So yummy. I have had a number of dishes here and have never been disappointed. The mashed potatoes and gravy are my favorite. The gravy is so good and the potatoes are super creamy. I usually opt for real cheese over the soy cheese, but it's nice that they offer both when splitting appetizers or meals with vegan friends. The desserts are really good too. I've had to wait a few times for dinner on the weekends, but usually I walk right in.
