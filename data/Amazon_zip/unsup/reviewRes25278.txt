First course cheese fondue was the best. I could have eaten it with a spoon. Vegetarian pal & I elected the veggie entree, which was fun but, in retrospect, skippable. It wasn't bad, it just wasn't as good as the appetizer and dessert. Many of the sauces are best paired with meat, and the 3 courses together were more food than we could possibly eat. Flaming chocolate fondue with fruit was also a good time and yum. Next time: cheese, chocolate, wine. C'est tout.
