Pineapple Ice cream shake. Yea so the hot dog was good (but i do get them plain), fries just ok, but the pineapple shake! SO amazing. You must get it. I normally do not like chunks of things in my drinks, but the pieces of pineapple were big enough to chew on and were so great. But only four stars cuz the shakes are small and pricey.
