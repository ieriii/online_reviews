Yes, it lives up to the hype. Yes, it's totally worth it. Insanely creative. Polished deconstruction. And most of all, fun. Wow. I'm still in awe of it all. This is minor, but if I could change one thing, I would have opted out of the wine pairing. We came into this with a "go big or go home attitude," and we got to taste some interesting varietals...but for $150 per person, the pours were quite small. On a do over, I would have just purchased a couple of bottles instead.
