This place is over rated. I went with my family on a Saturday afternoon for some lunch, around 2pm and there was line out of the door. Okay I know the place is getting a lot of hype so I decided to stay thinking "well this could be good." After waiting in line for about 1.5 hours we decided to get the food to go. After ordering it took about 30 minutes to get the food to us. Let me just say: The people working were unorganized, rude and indifferent. The place is small and not set up for the kind of crowd he is bringing in. It doesn't work. The food was terrible! I paid $50 for chips and salsa, 3 tortas and soup. All of the food was cold, tasteless and not worth spending 2 hours waiting in line to order. The food is not gourmet at all! Don't spend your time or your money.
