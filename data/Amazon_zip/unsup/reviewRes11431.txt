I've been waiting to go to this place for so long.  I love Pizza , craft beers, and the neighborhood Piece is in. This seemed like a perfect fit. The beer was pretty great. I drank the Golden Arm and the Dark and Curvy. I wouldn't buy them over a lot of my favorite brands, but great job by a restaurant that brews in-house. The pizza was a disappointment for me. It wasn't bad, but it just wasn't great. I put it in-line with the pizza from California Pizza Kitchen. Now if you like the thinner crust and subtle flavors, then you will probably like Piece. I like more robust flavors and creative combinations from the restaurant.  They let you customize your pizza, but they don't seem to have much of an identity or specialty when it comes to their pizza. The service was good, but my waiter was a little too hipster casual. I like the casually dressed staff (it is a pizza joint), but talk with some enthusiasm and "act" like you are happy to serve me. He gave another table next to us crap for not knowing the difference between a wheat beer and a regular ale. It wasn't in joking form, either. All in all, good time. I'll come back for the beer and good atmosphere (great for groups), but I'll pass on the pizza.
