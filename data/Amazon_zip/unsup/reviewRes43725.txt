The smoked salmon - lox, bagel, cream cheese, cucumber, red onions, capers, and tomato - came out separated on my plate instead of already built into a sandwich. It was very awkward to build the sandwich myself and it left my white shirt stained with tomato and my hands smelling strongly of salmon. I also tried the chips off my friend's plate and they were overdone, and she didn't finish her breakfast burrito because it was kind of gross.
