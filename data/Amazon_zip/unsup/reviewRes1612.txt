I wish that Hot Doug's had a larger location, because it really is tough to stand outside smelling the grill and watching other people eat for a half-hour. The line on weekends is rough on a hangover, but the greasy food can cure that hangover right up. The combinations of meat, cheeses, and sauces isn't rivaled anywhere else in the city. The rotation of sausages makes it impossible to have a favorite, although I do try and order any cherry-pork sausages I see rotated onto the menu. I can't think of anything new to contribute to the other great reviews. The service is excellent, and this place is a real Chicago staple. The duck fat fries kind of go through your system like White Castle sliders, but the taste is something that needs to be experienced!
