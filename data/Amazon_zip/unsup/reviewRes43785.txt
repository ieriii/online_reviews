The environment kills this place!  The food is tasty yet it's very difficult to get over the self-service aspect and the noise.  I went there early last Sunday, and the place was teaming with kids! Add to that the yapping dog that was sitting right outside the door and the too-loud (and bad) music, and you've got the perfect recipe for a miserable experience.  If you want a relaxing atmosphere or a just place where you can hold a conversation over your meal, this is not the place to go! If you have kids, a loud dog, or want some techno with your breakfast, hit it.
