When eating sushi in the hood, I rarely stray from my beloved Toro. But it's closed on Mondays and I was in the mood to cry from wasabi, so we decided to give Wakamono a try. So glad we did! I can't believe I've been living blocks away for nearly 2 years and this was my first trip in. Wasabi soba noodles were awesome -- light and just spicy enough. Seared Tuna with wasabi butter -- delicious, but could have used more wasabi -- thankfully, I ordered extra on the side to satiate my tear ducts. Edamame -- some how managed to be extra delicious, they were crispy and the beans seemed bigger. And the piece de resistance... The Ninja - a perfectly placed collection of various sashimis...a couple tunas, some salmon, hamachi and shrimps. Delicious. We had the roll of the day too, but I can't remember what it was. Awesome though. Plus, nobody raised an eyebrow when I asked to have it mayo-free. Any time my aversion to mayo-like things is met without judgment, I'm extra appreciative. Cute patio. Friendly service. Wine list is just ok, and overpriced. They do allow BYOB for a small fee -- I think it's either $5 or $8.
