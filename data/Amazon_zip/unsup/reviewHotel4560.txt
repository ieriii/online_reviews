This review is for those of you planning a wedding or big event. My wife and I were set to celebrate our 10th wedding anniversary on June 23rd of this year. I really wanted to do something special to recognize the occasion. Since we got married at the Palmer House, in the beautiful and historic Empire Room. I called the Palmer House's catering office and spoke with Jane Himmel, the Senior Catering Manager. I inquired as to the availability of the Empire Room for our exact anniversary date, June 23rd - a Thursday. Opportunity struck when I was told the room was not being used for a previously scheduled event that night. I suggested my idea to Jane that my wife and I have dinner for 2 in the Empire Room on the night of our anniversary, just as we celebrated our wedding there 10 years ago to the hour. This is when Jane and her team took over. To my surprise and excitement, Jane took this idea from the start and worked very hard to make this idea, this dream, become a reality. I worked with Jane over the next couple of weeks and days leading up to our night. She helped me pull off one of the greatest nights and best memories my wife and I will ever share. The Palmer House is a beautiful and historic hotel. Please consider when you stay here or have an event here that what you may be giving up in terms of modern amenities and size of the hotel rooms you gain in elegance, class, service, a sense of history and an experience to be had in your lifetime.
