This is a great spot for girl's night out, especially during their half-off specials. The rolls are pretty good, there's no corkage, and I love the dark trendy vibe. They have one of the best creamy ginger salads in the city and the seaweed salad is generously portioned. The honey and spicy scallop rolls are amongst my favorite. I recently threw my bf a surprise 30th bday dinner here and Sushi X was so accomodating. We had a group of 16 and they gave us the curtained side section. They also let me drop off wine and cake in advance because they have a walk-in cooler. I was a bit nervous for the final tab because we had several large platters of sushi. However, with tax and tip it only came out to $30/head.
