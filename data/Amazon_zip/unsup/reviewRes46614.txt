Every time I've been here (and tried to get a table here) it has been ridiculous packed. Even when we've made a reservation we've had to wait for a little bit. If you go during the week its not as bad. I enjoy their burgers and homeade chips but the salad bar is pretty darn good. They have some more unique items like chopped liver (mmm) that you don't find on every buffet so its a bit more unique. Like all salad bars it can get messy especially since everything is very compact in this space and you have to sometimes reach across 3 other bins of food to get to your selection. If you're a hygiene-freak don't eat at this salad bar. I had the chili on my most recent visit because it was cold outside and I wanted something warm to go with my salad...pretty good. The portion was huge too. I'd never gotten the cookie sundae but I do recommend it after I had it last night - chocolate chip cookie with ice cream and hot fudge or a cinnamon cookie with ice cream and caramel. Yum. The half portion is plenty for 2.
