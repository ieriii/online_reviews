This is a great beer bar for people that like a large selection of draft and bottled beer. There is also a full bar for non-beer drinkers. It is a great place to try new beers if your feeling adventurous, as well as have a couple standards (Anchor Stream or Ayingers). It gets crowded, but if you are lucky enough to score a table or better yet a booth, it makes for a great night of conversation and beer. They also serve food and have a rather eclectic menu that is full of great things to try.
