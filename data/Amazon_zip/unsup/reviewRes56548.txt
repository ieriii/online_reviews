For South of the Border Fare? It simply does not get better than this.Perhaps the most amazing ceviche I have had in years. A perfect, crisp and authentic Mezcal spritz was paired by our server. AMAZING.Alas, no Bayless sightings... but my wife and I felt like it was our seconf=d honeymoon.The real revelation was the price. We would have payed 3 times as much for the pleasure.GO!
