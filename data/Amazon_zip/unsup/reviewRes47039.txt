I was with a group of 20 and the staff seemed peeved. The whole it seemed like they were annoyed at us. I'm vegan and the only choice was faux pho which cost $15 and was the blandest dinner I ever had. The tofu was the best part of it and for those of you who know what tofu tastes like, that is not a good thing. This place is over priced and totally pretentious.
