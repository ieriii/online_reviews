I love the Hopleaf. The only reason I give it 3 stars is that it has gotten way too crowded. Good luck trying to get in with more than 2 people on ANY night after 7 PM.  The food is great. The beer selection is amazing. The wine selection is extremely small (2 reds by the glass to choose from) but always good. This is not a fancy place, it is a bar. It is really smoky in front and even if you sit in back you will come out smelling like smoke. The service kind of sucks but we always went back for more because the overall package is great..  The garlic aoli and the pomme frites are to die for.  The main thing that stopped us from going (we were regulars) is that we couldn't get seated anymore. Maybe you can grab a few tables in the front, but maybe you can't. Too bad for you if you met friends there for dinner.
