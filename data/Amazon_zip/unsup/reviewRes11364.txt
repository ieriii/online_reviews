Probably the BEST eggs benedict i've tasted in my life!!!! the egg was cooked perfectly. we had the shrimp, avocado & feta benedict...... OMG soooooo good! and also tried the White chocolate caramel pretzel pancake. WOW, this pancake was also delicious. Loved the mixture of the white chocolate and caramel on the pancake... pancake had mini pieces of pretzels mixed in the batter. I was so full from eating hot doug's prior to coming here, but we HAD to try this place and i'm glad we did. LA has a lot of good brunch places, but by far this is definitely my favorite!! i'm definitely flying back to chicago to eat here.
