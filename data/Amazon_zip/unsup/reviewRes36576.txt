Greek Town is unchartered territory for me but if Meli Cafe is any indication of what's to come, I am stoked. This place is fresh, tasty, and well priced. In fact, I will walk several blocks (and I do mean several) just to get one of their Apple, Carrot, & Celery juices. Their menu is not lacking in options and everything I tried was outstanding. The staff was attentive and the manager was exceptionally personable. If you need a good brunch/breakfast place in the west loop area I highly recommend this spot.
