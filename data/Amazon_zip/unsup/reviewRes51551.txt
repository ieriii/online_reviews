My husband and I went here on a Friday night for a change of pace from the other Mexican restaurant we frequent in Lincoln Square. When we arrived, the place was hoppin', which is usually a good sign. The service was fine and the margaritas were good, but the food was just OK. They have a HUGE menu, which leads me to believe that they are cranking out a lot of different dishes and not really specializing in anything. I had chicken fajitas that tasted bland, although the next day I reheated the leftovers and they seemed to have improved. The portions were gigantic, so I guess if you're hungry, that's a plus. They are open late so I'd guess this place might taste better after a night of drinking. We probably won't go back to Garcia's unless it's late and we're stumbling home from Huettenbar.
