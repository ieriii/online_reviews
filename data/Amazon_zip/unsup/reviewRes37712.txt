I haven't had the same issues with the wait time..but I did feel the establishment has a sort of 'i'm cool, so that's why I am here vibe'...which usually leaves me at 'no thanks'. Beyond that here goes... What I consumed as far as food, okay...not really memorable...in that, I can't even recall what the dish is... The beer selection and no kids policy make it great. Also, the waitstaff was attentive and on top of it throughout the meal and after drinks. I have to say, this area of the city, Andersonville, is enjoyable...there are so many fine establishments, which is yet another reason I feel this place is 'okay' instead of awesome or great.
