The cocktails are mixed to perfection by really helpful bartenders. My brother complained that the Moscow Mule wasn't served in a copper mug as if he's some kind of snob but our server humored him with an intelligent explanation. Our table ordered family style so we could sample a bit of everything. I highly suggest this route on restaurants everywhere. There were four of us so we split an appetizer, a salad, and two main courses. The service is amazing and the food is fantastic. LOVE Gilt!
