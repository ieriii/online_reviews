I have had the pleasure of staying here a few times and I've never written a review before. The location is absolutely astonishing for a Chicago visit. It's close to the usual assortment of tourist mandated visits but it's also a great location for just getting outside and taking a walk through Downtown Chicago. The Staff is extremely friendly and they really do go out of their way to make your stay enjoyable. I mean even the maids greet you in the hallway when they see you.  Meal choices are fair, but expect to pay top dollar to eat, or drink, in the hotel. It's Chicago, get out and eat somewhere else. The parking is extremely over-priced at $50 a night. We opted to rent a car from Enterprise (within walking distance) and turned it in every night for less than $32 a day for a compact car. The gym is placed in an odd location and it looks like it was just put there because the space is probably un-usable for anything else. Nonetheless, a good assortment of ellipticals and treadmills, all with tv's built in. There were also some weight machines and free weights, butfloor space is limited and more than 2 people and you've got a problem. WiFi is not complimentary and I believe it's like $10 a day. I found that rather cheesy, but I paid it anyway out of necessity. The rooms were nice and roomy and mine overlooked the Chicago River and Navy Pier. The wall were however paper thin as one night our next door neighbor received a call from his wife at 2:30am and proceeded to rip into his ass about leaving when their 5 year old child has an ear infection...and she had to work late. Never fret, after 15 minutes he calmed her down and got his mother to come over and help with "Brandon." and yes, we heard all that! All in all not a bad place to stay and I'd do it over again.
