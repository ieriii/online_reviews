Oh my Buddha, Opart you are good. I venture to say that this was my first "authentic" Thai dining experience. Our group of four started with the Fried Tofu and and Egg Rolls. Neither rocked my world, but was just the opening act to an even better plot. We then split the Curry Fried Rice, Chicken Pad Prik King, and Kuay Tiew Neau Sub (beef with gravy). All were outstanding, especially the beef. I saw the table next to us with interesting looking beverages, which I am assuming was Thai Iced Tea. Next time I'll have to try one rather than sticking with some boring h2o. Incredible meal, great prices, wish it was closer to my hood!
