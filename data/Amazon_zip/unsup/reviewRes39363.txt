Party of 12 was no problem. It's a big place although you'd never know from the tiny little door at the corner of the building. Was a little scared at first from reading the other reviews about grease, intense smoke, and charcoal embers flying into my eye but the way they have it sectioned off keeps it easy for the staff to manage everything. Because the smell from the smoke is mentioned in every review I want to note that each table has it's own big draw fan (like the hood on your oven) and it keeps things pleasant enough. The smell on your clothes is there when you leave but I'd have to say that I've experienced worse (i.e. Moody's) Everything was great. We were lucky enough to have a friend at the table that alpha dogged all the ordering for everyone. Otherwise with a table that big of the inexperienced it could have turned ugly fast and almost did. Be ready though because once your order starts coming out it comes hard and fast. They're great about changing out the grill when it gets messy and are all around very attentive.  This isn't something I'd do all the time but might save it for once in a while and definately recommend it for big groups. The more the merrier we thought going in and we were right. Don't be stingy and try to split entrees. Everyone should get something and share with the rest of the table. We all got our own meats, great appetizers, soups, and big community beers for the table and with a 20% tip it worked out to about $34 each.
