Good pizza, extremely friendly staff, and a free drink. I'd certainly go back and plan on it. The to go pizzas were fresh, the cashier was happy to help me pick, placed the slices in the to-go box with a semblance of decorum often forgotten in other slice-to-go places. And I didn't know it, but apparently 2 slices gets you a free fountain drink.  All in all, good, quick thin crust that is easy to fold and eat.
