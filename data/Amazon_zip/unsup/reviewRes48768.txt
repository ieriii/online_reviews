pretty good. strange setup inside w/ just long tables running across the entire room so you're sitting next to other people. i couldn't help looking at their food and im pretty sure they thought i was crazy. anyway, i had the shrimp for brunch and it was so good! only4 stars though b/c there were only 3 shrimp and that just seems like way too little. also tried the apricot-pistachio (or maybe it's peach, can't remember) cake and the sticky bun. i prefer cinnabon and the cake thing is not worth it at all. should've gotten the bacon! (it's not even bacon, it looks more like pork belly)
