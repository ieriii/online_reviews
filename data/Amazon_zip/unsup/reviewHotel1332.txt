I was thoroughly impressed with a recent business conference at The Ritz.  The banquet staff were plentiful and professional. They fed us constantly - from a breakfast buffet in the morning, cheeses and fruits at snack time, buffet lunch, afternoon sweets and popcorn, and a buffet dinner. The bars at dinnertime were outfitted with top shelf liquor. The minute you put down an empty plate it was whisked away as if by magic. The conference room for daytime meetings was transformed into a dining room and stage for the evening festivities. Bravo, Ritz.
