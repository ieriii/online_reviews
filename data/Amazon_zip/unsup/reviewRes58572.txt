I've been to this place at least 6 more times since my last review. Every time, there is always something that grosses me out. Despite i LOVE their pizza and beer, I just cant go back there anymore. Couple times I found some whitish slimy stuff floating in my water cup. Yuck! The worst thing about it is that I would notice it after drinking at least half of the water. When I told the waiter he didn't seem to care. Though, he did bring another glass of water after we paid our bill, tipped him and were on our way out.Then, once I have sat on a seat with some sticky brown liquid on it. Double Yuck! I was wearing shorts so the thing got stuck to my leg. I went to the bathroom to wash it off, but didn't complain this time since the complaints don't go anywhere anyway. But even then, I thought every place have their bad days and I still returned. I came here again (God knows why?). Ordered beer (as usual), pizza, and water. This time both mine and my husbands beer glasses had stamps of some pink lip-gloss on the edges. I don't wear lip gloss nor my husband. Don't they wash their glasses? Triple Yuck!Come on, Piece, clean you glasses, dishes, tables and seats! Please? Then I'll come back again.Zero stars for zero hygiene + 5 star pizza/beer = 2.5 stars
