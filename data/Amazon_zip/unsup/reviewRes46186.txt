I simply love this place. Relaxed and upbeat atmosphere, delicious food, friendly and helpful service - it's an all around great place to reunite with friends and share a memorable meal! I've also been to the location in Las Vegas and it was the same great atmosphere, food, and service. The dinner I had there was a huge portion and I had leftovers for lunch the next day (and it was still tasty). I salivate when I think about Grand Lux :)
