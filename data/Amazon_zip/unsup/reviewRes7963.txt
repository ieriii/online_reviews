We have made Spacca Napoli a regular night out for our entire family. The kids love the food, and the restaurant gives my wife and I the feel that we are out for an adult evening. We can enjoy a glass aofwine and the pizza is really terrific - and everybody can enjoy their own pizza without having to sacrifice toppings for another's taste. While I can't quite eat a whole one, my 8 year old can. PROs: + Great food, for adults and kids + Decent, approachable wine list + Friendly staff, good service + For an appetizer, try the zucchini in white balsamic and love. It's heavenly. CONs: + If you have to wait, you will not be very comfortable (make a reservation if you can) + They offer pick up, but you have to order in person, which means... you have to wait in an already overcrowded waiting space
