To start, we had to reschedule our reservation because one of the couples in our party was in a fender bender on their way into the city. I was informed that due to their policy there would be a $200 charge for the cancellation. Excuse me? I understand if you were a no-show but we gave them several hours notice. Not only that, the hostess tells me she's been turning people away all night. I then queried, can't you give our table to the millions you've been turning away? She didn't get it. I then spoke with the Director and explained the situation and that we would reschedule in a few weeks. Although, it may be their "policy" it's not a good one to make a first impression for a restaurant charging exorbitant prices during a recession. Moving on to the the meal. Let's just say the 2nd course had more personality than the server for our table. She barely engaged in any conversation with our table of 4 and tried to take our plates before we were even finished...SEVERAL TIMES! When you are paying that kind of money and the portions are small, they should give you ample time to savor every last bite and then ask if you are finished. I guess when you have a 9:15PM reso they just want to get you out of there(we didn't even order the tasting). For all the hype and $500 later, we were sorely disappointed. The food itself was mediocre at best. I would like to be served the meal that earned them a Michelin star, because it wasn't the one we ate! Too many great restaurants in Chicago to settle for them. The only highlight was the Sommelier, Rob. Very knowledgable and passionate about his selections and we were not disappointed. We wish he could have been our server all night.
