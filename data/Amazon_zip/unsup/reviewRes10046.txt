My BFF recommended this as our double date in Chi-town =)... Very busy! Waited 40-45 min for our table. Had a sports bar/college bar ambiance. The pizzas were very good! And we had this the night after we tried deep dish! The beer and the beer samplers were good. The chocolate pizza was just ok, I'm not huge on chocolate but it was a very interesting concept. Overall we had a very enjoyable night with pizza and beer, if the BF and I ever head back to Chi-town, we would definitely make a stop by again, and recommend this to our friends.
