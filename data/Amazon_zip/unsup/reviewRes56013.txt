Outstanding! We had the regular burger because someone at work recommended it. It was probably the best burger I have had in the city, and I know my burgers. We added grilled mushrooms to ours. The burger fit the bun or the bun fit the burger. Know what I mean? Oh, and what a great bun! I like that the fries and ketchup are in separate serving dishes on your plate. I hate when you have to pour ketchup out of a bottle and it runs into other food on your plate. The staff was extremely courteous, friendly, and attentive. The food arrived in less than 10 minutes and we were not rushed in any way. It's a place where you can get in and out in 30 minutes if you have to, but can also linger around if you want to. My highlight of the day? Seeing Billy's smiling Irish eyes. It's always nice when the owner takes the time to greet his guests with such warmth. I will be back. Next time, I'm having the fish and chips! The Gage is Winning!
