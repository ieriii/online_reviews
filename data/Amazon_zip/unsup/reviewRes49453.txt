Spent a lot of time here, and did again a few days ago. The post-industrial decor detracts a little from the ambiance. But the staff are helpful, know their stuff, and head wine dude Brian Duncan is The Man...time and time again he has walked me and my friends through various choices on the list. One of the best cheese selections I have encountered outside of California or Europe, and they know how to pair them properly. Being able to get 2.5 oz pours as well as 6 oz. pours is a nice touch for those who wish to really sample. Love the fact that the place is always busy and hopping but have never had to wait more then a few minutes. Another place I miss when I'm away.
