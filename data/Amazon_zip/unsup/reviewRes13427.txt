I had the pleasure of trying out Rev Brew not too long ago and I can say that I would be pleased to go back again. Similar to Goose Island, they offer a good variety of menu items backed by a really nice beer list. The wings are pretty tasty as well as the fish and chips. I often have a hard time finding a good spot for fish and chips, but I really enjoyed what Rev had to offer. But the real stand out are the mussels - literally one of my favorite preparations I've had in restaurants. Something about the cider and cheese just sets it apart from so many of the other versions I've had (seriously, getting tired of these chorizo laden mussel dishes that are so uninspiring nowadays). Really enjoyed the crispy pork belly dish I had there too. Try it out!
