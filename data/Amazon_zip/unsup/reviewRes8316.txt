Went here for lunch during the summer, on a double date and of course for lunch, you aren't that hungry to eat an entire buffet of starters plus all the meat that is soon to be brought around. I thought for $60 a person, this food was not worth it! I would rather eat at a Chicago Steakhouse and just have one side, one meat and a drink. I would say this place is a must if you are a first timer to Brazilian Steakhouse, but I've already had it a bunch of times, so I thought it was over rated for the price, especially for a lunch portion.
