The place to go in chinatown for spicy food. This place serves Szechuan chinese food which is generally very spicy. The chili chicken is fantastic. This dish comes out covered with red chilies, but it is more for show than spice. Its like a tastier, spicer version of popcorn chicken from KFC. The hunan beef is also awesome. Great place, and I hope the food stays this way..
