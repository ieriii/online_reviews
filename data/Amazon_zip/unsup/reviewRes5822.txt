Excellent place. I heard Oprah used to own a restaurant at this very location. Although it is a large place, it did not feel cramp. Bar area was nicely spacious. We were promptly seated. We ordered the crusted medallion of fillet mignon, porter house, flounder, and a simple T-bone. All are deliciously made. Sides are served separately and the right portioned. Desserts are also just right. Very pleasant evening. I am not sure about the neighborhood. They could have found a better location.
