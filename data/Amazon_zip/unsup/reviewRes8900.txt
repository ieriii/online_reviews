I came here in the hopes of having "amazing" pizza, after having read all the rave reviews about it. It actually wasn't bad, but I have beef with some other aspects of my visit. The guy in the front was pretty rude, and spoke to me condescendingly when I asked to sit at the bar. I had no idea there wasn't one, but I didn't need a smart-ass comment from him. Also, I realized it wasn't a super-quiet date spot, but I adamantly refused to sit near a gang of screaming children, while being bathed in bright bright light. Sorry again, rude man in the front. The waitress was awesome and helpful, however, so she worked to make a few wrongs a right. What I didn't like about the wine was the glass. This is obviously a traditional way of serving wine in Italy, but I'm not down with drinking wine from a gargling glass. I think a person should have a choice. I like a wine glass. With a stem. Please. Enough was said about the pizza for gentle readers to realize it's good. I just wouldn't want to go here again for dinner because of the ambience. Screaming kids, gargling glasses, bright lights. It's more of a lunch spot.
