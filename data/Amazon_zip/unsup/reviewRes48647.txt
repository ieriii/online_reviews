My friends and I came here for a double birthday with a massive party. The first thing I noticed when I walked in was the Thanksgiving styled tables where everyone sat and dined together. Even though we had reservations, it was still a wait to get us set up. Good thing was that they have such a good beer and drinks menu that we didn't really notice. The wait staff was great and friendly. We had a waiter who seemed to know his beer and recommended all sorts of stuff beers to us. One of the beers I liked was Dragons Milk. Overall I think this place is really cute! When I'm out in Chicago again, I'd like come back again to try the other items on the menu. Memorable foods: - Pork Rinds (YUMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM) - Porchetta - words cannot describe this...i don't think I could stop eating. - Snapper - we got the whole fish...head, tail the whole shabang! =) The meat was so tender and juicy and very few bones to pick out. It is a little pricy
