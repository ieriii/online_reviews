First off, let me apologize on behalf of a collective group of office associates who decided that going to a nice BYOB place for our holiday party would be a great way to hang out for the afternoon. We eventually got loud and obnoxious and over-stayed our welcome. With that said, you were gracious enough to put up with us for nearly five hours and I can say now that I appreciate that! In regards to the food, all I can say is you may have given me the best tasting pork I've ever had. Succulent, lucious, flavorful porky goodness served on a plate with some onions, rice, beans and maduros (sweet plantains, people). Simple perfection. Que se llama: PUERCO ROSTIZADO (roasted pork, people) I have a feeling that a fifth star is fast approaching from me, because I will surely be back. The one reservation I have about a fifth star was that I wasn't all that impressed by some of the appetizers. I'll hold back on talking about that until my next visit.
