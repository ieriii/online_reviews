Wishbone-No. 2 The configuration of this Wishbone, different than the West Loop location, lends itself to larger groups. The food is just as good as the place I first fell in love with the shrimp grits. I've had breakfast & dinner here. Sunlight seems to suit this spot better. The wait staff was very 'kid friendly', something I appreciate more each day. Not just for me, but I think you can judget a restaurant based on how they accomodate children. If they're bad with kids, how much better will they be with grown ups? gOOd jOb wish!
