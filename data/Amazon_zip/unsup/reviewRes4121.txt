This isn't really a review, since I haven't actually eaten at Schwa...more of a warning to not enter unless you have a reservation. My boyfriend and I tried calling 3 times, and no one answered the phone. So we stopped by to see if we could get a table. When I walked in everyone looked at me like I was a crazy freak, and finally a chef came out to inform me that they are reservation only, but that they do not answer the phone during serving hours. He checked to see if we could get a table, but they did not have enough food to accomodate us. I suppose we will try again another time, at least they were realatively friendly in declining me service.
