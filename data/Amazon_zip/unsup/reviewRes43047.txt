This place is super awesome. Half of us got there early and we started ordering/eating. We definately killed more than our portion but the check was split evenly so no compliants there. No blue label. I was feeling Johnny Blue but they dont have it. Oh well. Bone Marrow. It was good but I think the idea of eating bone marrow is exotic enough that as long as it doesnt taste like shit, people will like it. Steak tartar. This is fcukin amazing. I've never had raw steak before but this tops it off. The next time I go, I will get 3 of these babies, slowly eat 1, swallow the second in 1 mouth ful, and slowly enjoy the third. In conclusion, get the m'fkin steak tartar.
