If you're looking for a great burger, you have to make this a stop. I got their "Lockdown" burger and was not disappointed. The bun did a good job of covering the large burger (instead of covering up a small burger). I especially liked that the cheese was cooked in the center. The medium rare was cooked perfectly, and the included ingredients made for a tasty meal. Make sure you opt ($2 more) for the baked macaroni/cheese. I also had an appetizer that arrived with the burger so perhaps in the future they could work on the timing. BTW, the appetizer, mussels in a coconut sauce- excellent and a big portion. I know they have a good beer selection, but maybe create some mixed drinks for us wussies?
