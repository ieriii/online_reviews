Location! Location! Location! Finding a hotel in Chicago for labor day weekend was easy...finding a decent and convenient four star spot under $120 was somewhat of a challenge until we discovered Hotel Allegro. It's located in the perfect area in Chicago's Downtown Loop/Theater District-a block away from the CTA subway station, walkable to Millennium Park/Grant Park and a quick stroll to the Magnificent Mile. It's a cute hotel with it's own unique charm. The staff was GREAT! They were nice enough to let us check-in early and not leave us stranded....just 8 hours early at 7:00am! And even more helpful at 3:00am when we were in search of some late night grub- deep dish pizza delivered to our hotel room. Although the room/bathroom was only average and could use another renovation, it was fine for the weekend. They made up for it with their daily complimentary wine hour at 5pm, free in-room Wi-Fi, goose down comforters, fitness center (cardio equipment with TVs) and endless Aveda toiletries!
