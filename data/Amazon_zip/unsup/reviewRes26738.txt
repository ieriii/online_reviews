What else can you say other than awesome. Well, you could say very expensive, but I don't think you're making reservations here to save money. Very enjoyable experience recently. Let them know ahead of time we were celebrating our first anniversary and that flowers were being delivered for my wife. They had everything ready, right on time, and served up two very good (and complimentary!) glasses of bubbly. The service was great, very polite and professional. We went the tasting/wine pairings route, which was very enjoyable. Every dish was unbelievably complex, ranging from edible flowers (who knew?) to fantastic wagyu beef and halibut. The wine pairings were great, and married with their course astonishingly well. The final dessert pairing was a little different, I think it was Pedro Ximenez or something. A very thick, raisin flavored sherry, comparable to maple syrup. My wife wasn't the biggest fan, but I though it was a cool twist. The staff graciously substituted a lighter wine, as they quickly noticed she wasn't too happy with it. Pretty cool in my book; without asking they brought her a secondary, more palatable option. Everything about this place was the tops (including the bill!). We will for sure be back, but it may have to wait until tax season LOL :) Thanks Graham Elliot for a wonderful anniversary dinner!
