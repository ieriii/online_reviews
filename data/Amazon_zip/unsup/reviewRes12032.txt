We had made our reservation probably 2 weeks in advance to celebrate our friendship reunion with people who came from as far as Vienna, Austria. The reservation was for about 15 people which changed for different reasons to 11. Arriving on time at the restaurant we were greeted friendly by the host and after most of us have arrived, were led to our table through the at least half empty restaurant. Sitting down, the waiter introduced himself (I am bad with names) and apologized that it is only his second day.... oh well, some learn swimming the best when pushed into cold water. After receiving our drinks he disappeared and would not show up for taking our orders for appetizers... It was kind of spooky: He shows up, serves a drink and disappears again just like a magicians in a cloud of smoke.... I was naive enough to feed the meter for 2 hours, which in most cases is plenty for a Sunday afternoon brunch. It took an hour for appetizer orders to be taken and delivered - there was no other complimentary food like bread or chips + salsa offered. Hard questions like: "Are you serving Sprite or Sierra Mist?" remained unanswered. But in between we were lucky to catch a chance to order our main entree which was delivered at 1:20 ... I am that precisely with time since it is unbelievable how slow service can be - and I am not just pointing at the brand new server, the restaurant management should have had a more experienced waiter at least with him to train him. THe food was great and deserves at least 4 stars, but unfortunately the whole dining experience was kind of pulled down due to the super slow service. If it had been just my bf and me, I had walked out - but it is hard with a large group like this. I guess if you keep your company's number small, it is a good restaurant, but I hesitate to bring in bigger crowds.
