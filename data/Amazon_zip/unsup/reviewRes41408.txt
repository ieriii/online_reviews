To all the people that bad mouth chain restaurants... This is your answer. There is a reason you can find Ruth's Chris in all the big cities: The place is the shiznittle boom bang. A warm comfortable environment that makes you feel like you're sitting by the fireplace at grandpa's house with a glass of red and a mean fillet layed out in front of you. If grandpa is donald trump perhaps. It's definitely a classy joint with a steak thats worth the trip.
