The food is amazing. The experience is simply unforgettable. Alinea is more than just amazing cuisine, it's about the presentation of the meal, and as cheesy as it sounds, how it evokes all your senses throughout. Chef Achatz has truly created a dining experience that must be one of the best in the world (ranked 6th worldwide as of this writing, according to Restaurant magazine, 1st in USA). as someone who doesn't go out of my way for fine dining ALL the time, i really enjoyed myself here and appreciated each and every one of the 18 courses. dishes such as the oyster leaf, short rib deconstruction, and rabbit 3-ways, were ingenious. the infamous black truffle explosion certainly lived up to its name. the last 4 courses were reserved for dessert. dishes that stood out to me were the lemongrass test tube shooter, and - what seems to be really the perfect way to end a meal - a deconstructed frozen chocolate dessert, created with a variety of ingredients, of which are literally painted onto your dinner table. frankly speaking, to me this meal felt like an art gallery being presented to you one piece at a time. if you get the chance, Alinea is well worth the experience.
