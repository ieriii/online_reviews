Used to be good back in the day.. Ordered shrimp kabab chicken kabab and shish kabab .. Wasnt tasty at all. Rice was bland with no salt at all. Hummus had too much garlic. I liked this place years ago, now I rather eat at that small Salam place across the street that is much cheaper for the same quality. Sorry noon a kabab I won't be back
