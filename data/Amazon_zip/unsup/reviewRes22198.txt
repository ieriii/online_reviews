The Greek Island Restaurant is just an A-OK place to eat. I took one of my friends to eat there because she really wanted to try Greek food. She was really impressed, but then again she is from a little town and doesn't experience great cuisine. The best part was the service. The serves was worth four stars since they were inattentive and friendly. The food was unrememberable. It really wasn't anything better than any other Greek restaurant in Chicago. Sorry Greek Island... Good first time, but most likely a last time...
