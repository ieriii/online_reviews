I've been twice. First was was a friend. The second time was with my girl friend and another couple. Everyone was pleased with the food here. My favorite is the bone marrow. Out of this world. I think I've sampled everything on the menu and I can't think of a single dish that I didn't like. Everything worked well. Savory person's (like my self) paradise. The place seemed to be more of a after work place than a weekend place. It was packed on my first visit after work on a week day. Lots and lots of hot women. I believe the girls in the table next to us were making out. My second visit was around 745 on a Saturday. It was a lot quieter, but started to pick up when we were leaving. I also noted a cool, cash only bar in the basement. Very dim lighting..I'll have to check it out next time I'm there.
