over two hours wait for this place? a place that only serves hot dogs? not any hot dogs but exotic ones... from all types of wild animals shoved into a casing...with some crazy toppings? was it worth it? yeah it sure was... this place is pretty well known in Chicago and now their popularity (so has their lines) has doubled cause of Anthony Bourdain... fill ya pie hole up with duck fat fries on friday and saturday only and go with anything on their menu . . . its disgustingly good!
