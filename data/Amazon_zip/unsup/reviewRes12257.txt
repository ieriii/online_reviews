Cafe 28 is one of my favorite places to eat in Chicago. I've been going here for 9 years now and the food and service have been consistently good during that time. Kudos to the owner and staff for keeping the quality high. The place is a lofted dining room along with further seating in back. The tables are cozy but it's never to loud to carry on a decent conversation or have to scream to be heard. The service is attentive with most of the staff having been working there for several years so they know the menu and the drinks very well. The frozen mojito hear is extraordinary! They are just chalked full of mint and go down easily... sometimes too easy! I always get the Ropa Vieja here along with a side order of Maduros. The steak in the this dish is marinated so well - with the flavors of the peppers and seasoning just adding to the flavor of the meat. Just so well done for a somewhat simple dish. The rice and beans along with the steak make for a hearty meal. This is my favorite place for Ropa Vieja and it's the standard I judge a Cuban restaurant on - and Cafe 28 does it very very well. The desserts are good here - especially the tres leches and rum cakes. Give them a try if you still have room after dinner.
