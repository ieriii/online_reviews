I can't believe I've never once written a review for Calo, as someone who grew up in this neighborhood who's aware of how many decades this place has been around, and even pre-dates my birth. Better late than never to finally do one, and where do I begin? With the exception of the thin crust pizza(as pizza that's extra greasy isn't my normal style, but tolerate it once in a great while), the majority of food I've had here over the years has been great. In contrast to the thin crust pizza, I am a fan of their stuffed pizza. Their pasta, seafood, chicken etc. dishes are very filling, and I like how the portions are generous. I'm also a very big fan of the BBQ ribs, and the sauce that comes with it is so good, that it makes me wanna track down the chef to get the recipe for it! Unfortunately, their BBQ rib special is no longer $10(likely because of rising food prices), but they still have it at $13 from time to time. While I prefer how the place used to look before its early 2000s renovation, I'm happy at least it still has some of the feel I remember it having pre-renovation. Was initially indecisive on 4 or 5 stars, but will go with 5, due to the fact I have so many memories of eating here growing up, and can't think of a serious reason not to give it 5. And you can't really go wrong with a place serving Italian food that isn't too expensive(despite increased food prices), and with generous portions.
