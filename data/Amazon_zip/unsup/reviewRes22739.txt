I was fortunate enough to receive a $100* gift certificate to Greek Islands, which was awesome because I'm generally a big fan of eating in Greektown, despite how incredibly kitschy I think it is. So last night I redeemed my gift certificate and heres what I thought: The good: service. The bad: tons of kids running around. The ugly: the most oil-drenched food I've ever had. Blech.  Summary: Pegasus (right up Halsted) is much better.  *by the way, our bill came to exactly $99.17 - how great is that?
