This was our first visit -- great beer and great food. We got the bacon popcorn to start, and it was only ok... I thought the popcorn was a little stale, but with bacon and cheese on top, one would hardly notice that fact. My husband ordered the Smoked Buffalo Chicken pizza and said it was one of the best pizzas he's ever had. I had the Moroccan Chicken salad and it was AWESOME! the curry dressing, the couscous, the chicken.... mmmmm.... tasty. When the food runner brought the wrong soup for a friend, the waitress quickly remedied and took the soup off our bill, which we obviously didn't request, so that earned major points in the service department.
