Myself and other fellow Koreans agree this place is da bomb. They have taken a cuisine that is good and adapted it very well for Lincoln Park patrons and Korean food conisseurs alike without losing the key flavors. (Chinese and Thai restaurants please take note.) Bravo. This place is good for lunch, a casual dinner, or order pick-up for your Superbowl party.
