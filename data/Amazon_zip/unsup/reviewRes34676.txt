I love the salad bar at Sultan's! Spiced cauliflower, kimchee, beets, shrimp and brussel sprouts are just a few of the goodies. The falafel is fresh and crispy; I only wish they had a tahini sauce to complement. The lentil soup is light and refreshing. The lamb shwarma was overspiced, dry and chewy. Definitely go vegetarian here.
