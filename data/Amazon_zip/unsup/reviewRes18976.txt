We were here a few months ago to take in concerts at Symphony Hall and we sort of happened to walk by this place and made a dinner reservation. We shared a seafood entree which was excellent and dessert. We elected to sit at a table outside since the weather was pleasant. Our server was very helpful also. The only complaint I have about this restaurant is that it's noisy inside. I would like to try it again on another visit!
