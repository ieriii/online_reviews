"That place with the fists, right?" Sounds like the opening line of a horrible, horrible movie, but it's one of the hottest new brew pubs in town. I've been hearing about this place for ages. Some of my favorite wait staff from my usual watering holes left to go work there. I *love* beer. Needless to say, my interest was about as high as it gets. It's a bit of a haul to get there from downtown, but worth every dime in cab fare. Once you walk in, the place is gorgeous. It's full of people, but not cramped. We were seated right away, and the waitress was right there with menus and some much needed water. Everything on the menu... everything... looked great. We started with bacon fat popcorn. It sounds so cliche. Bacon is all played out, right? Wrong. Freshly popped pop corn with chunks of bacon and (I think?) sage sprinkled on top. So awesome. A couple of us ordered burgers, and I got a personal pizza. The burgers arrived about one step undercooked from the order, but absolutely edible. The pizza was really quite good. Chorizo, salsa verde... how can you go wrong? As good as it was, the food is offset by the beer entirely. The brew there was outstanding to say the least. Between the three of us, we tired six of their brews and every one of them was amazing. You can see the brewery through a gigantic window in the dining room and it's very clean, very professional looking. The beer was smooth, well filtered, and an absolute treat. Revolution is now on my list of places to take out-of-town guests who appreciate good food and great beer.
