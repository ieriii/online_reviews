I adore, love and dream about the breakfast here. I'm sure it has a zillion calories in it and I don't give a crap. My current favorite is the smore banana flapjacks. During the summer it was the blueberry cheesecake flapjacks. The sauces they make are the bomb. Other people I have gone with have liked the omelets but I can't get past the pancakes. I have to stop writing this because I am drooling on my laptop.
