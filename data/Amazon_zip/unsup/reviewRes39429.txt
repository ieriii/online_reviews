It's not that there wasn't plenty of banchan. It's not that the smoke bothered me or that I was put off by bad service. It's not that I thought this place was expensive, or that the meat wasn't good. I don't mind that the parking lot is small and you often have to wait for service. I just really think this place is so-so. And the fact that I am not in love with San Soo Gab San makes me feel this small pool of guilt, akin to how I felt when I realized that the rides at Great America didn't excite me anymore. As if my propensity to be blas is shrouding me from what should be some of the best stuff out there. Sad, isn't it? Well, the kimchi was pretty tasty. And if you do find yourself at this establishment, don't pass up the seafood pancake.
