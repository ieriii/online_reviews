Reminiscent of the gradiose hotels of the early 1900s... Beautiful high ceilings, gilt wood, lobby, pool (though it closed early), two smaller hot tubs, work out center, and room with city views. My boyfriend and I recently stayed there on valentine's day (which is a thursday, so...) for only $90 through priceline. The hotel just isn't at capacity in the winter and you can get great rates. We wandered through the spacious, empty lobby and stumbled on a grand ballroom, complete with balconies and elaborate, glass chandeliers. Great space for a wedding. Be aware... parking is almost $50 a night, truly a rip-off!! But the location can't be beat. Other downsides: most of the hotel's restaurants close in winter and Kitty O'Shea's, while open until 11 for food, was just not that good. But extremely affordable! Breakfast menu from room service was the only real disappointment, boring and veerry basic We were placed on the "Executive Floor", which I would almost certainly request if you can. They are higher floors with much better views. Little details in the service make a big difference to me. For example, I called to request tea in the morning and they brought up an enormous selection promptly, complete with creamers and to-go cups. I felt like Michael Jackson!! that's what they would give Michael Jackson. People say his star has fallen, but wouldn't you just poop yourself if he was staying in your hotel?? A note - You can buy passes to their gym/pool, not that I would ever work out in a million years. But some might. Some might. A 3-day pass to extensive facilities within walking distance to the Loop was $15, extremely reasonable. Back to the room: Warm colors, dark wood, smallish space, freshly tiled bathroom, white linens and comforter. Cable, but no DVD player. USA Today outside our door in the morning and check-out via phone from the room topped off the night. I would stay here again in a heartbeat. To hell with modern decor!
