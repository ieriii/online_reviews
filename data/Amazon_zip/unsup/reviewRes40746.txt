I just moved from Los Angeles, so Chicago burritos have a lot to live up to.  That said, I only recently started ordering burritos, so I'm no expert...Their size intimidates me, so I usually just stick with tacos. But today I really wanted something filling...meat, rice, beans, hot sauce, all in a brown paper bag. YUM. I'd been told that this place was good and whne I accidentally drove by it, I decided that it was fate. I ordered an asada burrito, added tomato, and had them hold the cilantro and onions (ew). My order came up quickly and I was out the door! When I took my first bite back at the office, I was like "Oh! There's a lot of meat at this end!" I chewed and chewed and chewed. Took another bite..."Wow...Still so much meat crammed into this end of the burrito!" Chew, chew chew...Another bite..."WHERE THE HELL ARE THE BEANS AND RICE?" Seriously, I've never had a burrito that doesn't come with beans and rice it in...WTF? Who wants a flour sock fulla beef? The hot sauce was good, they actually remembered to hold the onion/cilantro (yay!), but I got through about 1/4 of that beast before I had to call it quits. YIKES. I'd go back, but I'd definitely add rice and beans. Which is weird, but apparently how Chicagoans like their burritos.
