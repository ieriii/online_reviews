Best breakfast in Chicago. Period! I've had both breakfast and lunch meals there and all were heavenly. They don't serve dinner, but they don't need to. It makes the early day meals that much more enjoyable. Atmosphere is relaxing and nice, but not stuffy at all. I can;t tell enough people to go to Bongo Room. It will be the best decision you ever make! Im a huge fan of their benedict's and fresh squeezed orange juice, but if you're in the mood for something sweet, their pancake and french toast list will knock you off your chair! Go ASAP! You may have to wait to get in, but it's beyond worth it!
