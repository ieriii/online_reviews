Holy crap. Let's just say this. The food is incredible. Wow. The porkbelly, wildboar sloppy joe, the tuna (i stole food from each of my friends, it looked to good to pass up). Holy crap. Oh and the coffee I had with my creme brulee. It was one of the best roasts I have ever tried. Oh yeah and the drinks. Super cheap whiskeys. Some as low as $3 a glass. You must try this place.
