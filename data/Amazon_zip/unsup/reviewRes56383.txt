I ordered delivery from here last night! it was the best, some great foods for my vegetarian diet.Avocado wontons, veggie eggrolls, vegetarian's delite and some pumpkin soup all made my night. But there's more! I walked in for lunch today on my hour off and it was the best value I have ever found in Chicago. Soup, salad, hot tea, and tilipia entree. under 10 bucks, amazing how do they do that?Simply it, is just simply the best value, tasting and FIERCE!
