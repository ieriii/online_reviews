Psst. Look up at this restaurant's title. See that last part? "& Catering"? I'm here to tell you that their catering is DA BOMB and will make you popular around the office pretty quick. This time of year we have events a couple times a week, and I am so freaking sick of every single chain caterer we were ordering from. I whined to the person in charge of catering, "can we PLEASE try something new?" Her response was: "Restaurant X has the cheapest catering around. If you find something better and cheaper, then yes." In the words of the great Barney Stinson... CHALLENGE ACCEPTED. Enter Irazu. I showed her the menu. Showed her the prices. Somehow, I convinced her to try them out for a smaller event. And Irazu passed with flying colors. Everyone loved it. The food was delicious and we had plenty to go around. My boss loved the prices. They delivered on time. Set up was easy. They gave us actual silverware to use for serving (that I am determined to return to them, because, really?). And I think everyone agreed that we love supporting a local business over Corporate Caterers R Us. My coworker told me that the man at Irazu she's been working with has been a dream. After we used them a second time, I happened to be standing at her desk when he called to make sure everything went smoothly for us. Gotta love the follow up. So kids, if you want to have delicious, local food at a fair price at your next event, give Irazu a call. You will not be disappointed, and you will earn at least 15 popularity points around the office. Trust.
