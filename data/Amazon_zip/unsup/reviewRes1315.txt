There is nothing I can say about encased meats that has not already been written in a yelp review. What I can say, is that any wait you might encounter at Hot Doug's will be well worth it. When I had first moved to Chicago, we tried to eat at Hot Doug's, but the line was long and I was skeptical. No more. Doug is always happy and mindful of his customers. Your order is always brought hot, quickly, and delicious. I recommend the celebrity sausage, duck fat fries, and the traditional corn dog. If you have not been, this place is a must visit for any Chicago resident. I would go as soon as possible............
