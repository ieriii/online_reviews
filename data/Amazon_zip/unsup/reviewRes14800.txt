Stopped by for lunch w the wifey on a beautiful afternoon. Great setting! Amazing food, couldn't decide between the burger or the carolina pulled pork, but I didn't have to since they had a burger that had pulled pork on it!?!?!?!? I'm not a huge mircobrew beer guy, more of a bud man (not a cub fan) but the house beers were good. Will be back soon.
