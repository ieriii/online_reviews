From blocks away, you can hear the live music bumping at 90 Miles Cuban Caf. Other than getting an awesome Cuban sandwich and enjoying Cuban cuisine, this place offers a four seasons patio. It was a hot summer evening and there were plenty of summer dresses, flip flops, and bare skin. For an appetizer, we ordered a goat cheese empanada. It was fried deliciousness with a creamy center. We also split a Cuban sandwich and it was truly a classic - pulled pork, ham, mustard, and thinly sliced pickled. The whole sandwich was pressed to make the bread thin and crisp. 90 Miles Cuban Caf is the perfect local spot to kick back and relax.
