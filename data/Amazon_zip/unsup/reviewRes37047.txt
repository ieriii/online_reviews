I came here with some coworkers one night to enjoy a couple of drinks. They had a ton of different craft beers, but as I have mentioned in my previous reviews, I do not enjoy beer. I ordered a couple mixed drinks which I did enjoy. My coworkers tried a couple different beers, all of which they said were delicious. We also had an order of fried that came with a savory sauce. My issues with this place? It gets crowded quickly, you have to get there early if you want a seat because it is first come first serve... no reservations. We felt very in the way until a table opened up. We sat in the bar area at the booth that was the farthest away from the door. However, every time the door opened a cold breeze came in, so I had to keep my jacket on. Also, the service here was super slow. It was still a fun night out though!
