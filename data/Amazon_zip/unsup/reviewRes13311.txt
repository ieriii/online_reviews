Party of nine, at 9 on a Sunday night = 45 minute wait. This place doesn't take reservations, so first come, first serve! We started with an array of beers all made on location, which is awesome! I had something similar to a Hef, and it hit the spot! Next came the small bites, I tried the House Pretzel $6 - the sauce to dip RULED. Next, I took a bite of the Sweet Potato Cakes $6 - which were perfect silver dollar size, crispy outside, sweet tender inside and this beautiful red pepper crema on the side! Bacon Fat Popcorn $4, now - as awesome as this sounds, it really wasn't "bacon fat". There wasn't any type of grease, grissel, or ounce of "fat" on this popcorn. It was in fact fresh popped popcorn kernels, showered with shaved parmesan and pieces/chunks of meaty bacon. I still enjoyed it minus the fat kid fingers, but they need to be honest here! I orded the Smoked Pulled Pork sandwich $10 - this came with a side and the waitress recommended the Garlic cream cheese mashed potato. Those were just too thick and weren't very homemade at all, don't ever pair a sandwich with mashed potatoes. Major fail. The sandwich itself was alright, I feel like the South Carolina-style BBQ sauce really overpowered the juicy pork underneath. I could barely finish half of the meal. I'll come back to try more of their beers, the fritters, polenta fries and wings. Stick to the basics!
