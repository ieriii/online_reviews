Drunkenly came here on a Wed night around 130 am. Luckily, there was only one other party so we got all the attn we needed. No show of bad service voiced from previous yelpers. Side dishes and water came out immediately and we already knew what we wanted so those orders came out quickly too. I was AMAZED by how many side dishes there were!!! I counted: we had 21!!! as in... 16 more dishes than the normal amount you get in cali!!!! I especially like the sweet pickled lettuce cucumber thing, seaweed, the potato salad, the crunch clear noodle thingy?, spicy pickled cucumber, didn't like the kimchi as much. Enjoyed the spicy miso soup though. Nom nom!!! Can you imagine seeing all of this in front of you while buzzed and craving drunken munchies? Tummy heaven!! It was my first time ever hearing of seafood pancake and it was a great introduction. Reminded me a lot of the Vietnamese banh xeo. We also ordered 2 quantities of kalbi. The meat came on a platter with the bones. Odd, but whatevs. Some of the pieces had some cartilage...ehhh. The marinade is very diff from the ones I'm used to in CA. It wasn't as sweet, but you could really taste the meaty beef flavor. I was also impressed with how fast the meat cooked. Within 3-5 min!! I would've given 5 stars, but I didn't like the cartilage found in 2 of my pieces and I thought the marinade could be a bit sweeter.
