Seriously, guys. In a city where there are so many great places to try for brunch--roughly 148 of them in Wicker Park alone--why wait for an hour and a half just to get a table at Bongo Room? Once we finally got seated, my experience here was good. Our server was sweet and made sure we got everything we needed, but it was nothing remarkable. A small herd of cattle was sitting in the booth behind us, it would seem, so I have to dock a few points for the rodeo we experienced--bolt down those benches, y'all! Our food was delicious. Some very interesting flavor combinations and HUGE portions suited for sampling around the table. One of the guys in our group got the half order of some ridiculous chocolate breakfast item, and it defies description. The fact that what he was served was the half order speaks to why this country is obese. Either way, though, everything we ate was just splendid. After eating and enjoying, it was pretty clear that we needed to move out and make room for more customers, which was fine. Now that it's gotten cold, though, I'm loath to go back and endure another long wait outside. I'm more likely to go somewhere with a shorter wait, lower prices and a smaller distance to travel.
