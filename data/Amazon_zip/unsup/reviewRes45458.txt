I love going to Wilde Bar in the winter. The fireplaces, library, and wood panelling make it so cozy. The beer selection is great & they have good drink specials during the week. I also get random cravings for the meatloaf from here. It comes with a cranberry relish and onion straws...I kind of want it now.
