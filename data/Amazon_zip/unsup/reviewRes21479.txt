I dined here with my GF for the first time and came away very impressed... The look of the front of the place was pretty standard, but then the host led us back to the patio, which was truly delightful, with festive lights overhead and a waterfall. It was the perfect way to have a wonderful meal in the Summer. We both ordered Margarita's, both frozen flavors were very good, if not some of the best I've had in the city. So many places put so much Tequila in the drink, it's all you can smell, let alone taste - our drinks tasted like the fruit flavors we ordered, with a slight hint of Tequila Our food was very good as well! Not greasy and very flavorful!! Bonus points for great chips and salsa!
