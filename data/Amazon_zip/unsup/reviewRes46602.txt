I have ordered lunch and dinner from here and it wasn't bad, but the best thing about this place is the brunch buffet.  Fresh fruit and vegetables, sausage, mini waffles, bread pudding. I absolutely love it. If you have the means, I highly recommend it. It is so choice. However, the 70s theme gets old quick, and the place is just plastered with old pictures of young women, which kinda creeps me out.
