I usually enjoy going to this bar, however the blonde, buff bartender last night was very rude. I understand that when you see 4 chic's walk in and sit at your bar, you think, sweet these girls probably only want water and a diet coke. Well that is wrong. The four of us work in a bar, and love to over tip if you are at least somewhat nice to us. This didn't happen unfortunately with this female bartender. We all have bad nights working in a bar, but damn.
