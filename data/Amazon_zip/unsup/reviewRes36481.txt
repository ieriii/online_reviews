What a treat. Super clean, friendly staff, HUGE portions, and affordable. The coffee was excellent. We ordered a savory spinach and boursin crepe, a ginormous french toast stuffed w/ strawberries and marscapone, and a delicious & fluffy egg white omelet. They are open early too, which is nice if you go before brunch. Try it, you won't be disappointed! TT
