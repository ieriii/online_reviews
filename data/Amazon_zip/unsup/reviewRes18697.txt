Why do I come here? For the beer list! But that's not all, the food is amazing too! I never venture this far away from Lincoln Park but I'll make an exception for this place. I also found two of my favorite new drinks on a recent Saturday night. Bohemia ( a German-Mexican beer) and Pear Cider by Ace are both stocked in my fridge, so thanks for that first of all! It took my boyfriend and I about 20 minutes to even decide what to drink and we kept a copy of the beer list at our table to peruse during dinner. We started with the fried cheese curds which were out of this world. I normally don't like cheese curds but these were outstanding. The homemade buttermilk ranch dipping sauce is out of this world, order extra on the side! And now, on to the burgers! The belly burger caught my eye with braised pork belly and herbed horseradish on a pretzel bun and let me say I was not disappointed! The service was excellent and even though they were really busy, we only waited five minutes before sitting down. This place is laid back, chill, and don't be shocked to see lots of young children around. We were shocked by the number of babies and toddlers but it didn't really take away from our experience.
