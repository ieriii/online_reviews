AMAZING service. I would give them 10 stars and hug each of the waitstaff if I could.  As upscale as this place is, there was not one hint of pretension. We were prepared to have knowledgeable but stiff servers and were so surprised when we were greeted with warm smiles and friendly banter (that we started). The cheese man, the truffle lady, the bread server, and everyone in between catered to our every need, even my hubbie's requests to eat something twice since it was so delicious. Food: We liked it. We weren't awed, we felt like we had tasted similar flavors at other restaurants. We thought they tried to present the food differently by plating it on interesting servers but that was it as far as it went for unique qualities. I would highly recommend the homemade truffles and chocolates - it was the best part of the meal. And the dessert wines and ports - excellent selection.
