The fundamental problem with this recent trend of haute peasant restaurants--e.g., Gilt, Purple Pig, Kith & Kin--is the depressing disparity between the promise of the menu description and the kitchen's actual execution. To wit: the menu says "Sunnyside-up duck egg, beef tongue hash, black truffle vinaigrette"; the execution states "IHOP breakfast." I'm all for it, really, but you don't create much of a bigger miss than serving up a dish that equates to a hash house breakfast--you can eat it, sure, but all you taste is disappointment. It went on: sweetbreads are smoked here instead of the usual fried, but I was stunned by the horrendous kielbasa-like taste, the haunting mineral gaminess of the thymus gland completely wiped out. A potato agnolotti--imagine stuffing gnocchi into a large ravioli--was topped with foie gras AND escargot AND mushrooms--and then sauced with a bordelaise (that's bone marrow and demi-glace, for those keeping score at home). Seriously, four different meat flavors in a single small dish? Pure cow fog. Something has to give--and go. While the restaurant is young and may yet find its legs, the fact that all three dishes failed because of extraneous or poorly-matched ingredients is rather worrisome, no? Only a golden beet-goat-cheese-pastry amuse had any synchronicity; it was also boring. Not a good sign.
