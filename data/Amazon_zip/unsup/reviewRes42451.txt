IMO, It's OK. The best thing the Art of Pizza has going for it is that it's inexpensive. You can get a slice of Stuffed Pizza -- which is plenty -- and a large drink for under $5, which is something we can all agree upon. But when it comes to Chicago Style Pizza, everyone has different tastes, so take this with a grain of salt. I think it's definitely important to say that my favorite Chicago Style joint is Giordano's, and my least favorite is Lou Malnati's, so that gives you an idea about my own personal tastes so that you can see if you could possibly like this place or not. Cheese- Good, but they don't give you a ton in your pie. Not over-flowing like a lot of stuffed-pizza places, and cheese is my favorite part of the pizza, so the more the merrier. Sauce- A little over-powering. Zesty, which is good, but it overshadows the taste of the cheese and the toppings, which is kind of disappointing. Crust- Buttery, but extremely bready, meaning it's very thick and soft. I personally prefer crispier crusts. Still this place is pretty good, and I still eat here time-to-time. But is it the best in Chicago? I would say no.
