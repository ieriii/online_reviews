This place is great! The idea is to order a number of small plates/dishes to be shared throughout the meal.  We ordered the ricotta and honeycomb dish, focaccia with soft cheese, egg truffle toast and risotto carbonara (which we asked for over linguine instead and they delivered!). Everything we tried, we loved.  This place is great and definitely worth a try!
