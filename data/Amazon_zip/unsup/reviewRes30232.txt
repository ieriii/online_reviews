For some weird reason I did not want to have weird expectations for this place, but as you see the 5 stars, you can tell it well exceeded my expectations. I was supposed to meet my monthly veggie crew here at 7PM, but I made it at 6:25 and I was starving. One member of the crew was there and we decided to get a table while we waited for the others. I went with the gyro along with a small side of mac n cheese. The gyro included pita bread with sliced seitan, chopped onions, tomatoes & lettuce, with vegan tzatziki sauce. To be honest with you, that was better than any gyro that included meat. The mac n cheese was tasty as well. The waiter who was great, recommended the Metropolitan Dynamo Copper Lager, which was delicious. I was told they make it in Andersonville. I sampled the Half Acre Lager which was almost as delicious as the MDCL. Another great thing about this place is the outdoor patio in the back as everyone knows how I love eating and drinking outdoors. Inside seating is cool also as they have cozy little booths for your cuddling pleasure. The waitstaff was very helpful and accommodating. They answerd all of my questions with a smile and gave great recommendations. Definately will return and try some more goodies from their menu. Loved it!!!!
