Catching up on some reviews today. My wife and I stopped again at Hot Doug's and it's still as good as ever! We ordered the Blue Cheese Pork Sausage with Sir William Pear Cream and Roasted Almonds (always a good choice), the Smoked Portuguese Pork Chourico with Saffron Rouille and Rustico Red Pepper Cheese (Maria thought it was too spicy, she stopped eating it, so guess what..... I got to finish it off yum), the Cognac-Infused Lamb and Pork Sausage with Spinach Raita and Manchego Cheese (it was similar to a gyro, another good sausage Doug), the Swiss Cheese Smoked Pork Knockwurst with Bacon-Garlic Mayonnaise and Vintage Van Gogh Cheese (excellent mayonnaise). the Smoked Shrimp and Pork Sausage with Cajun Remoulade and Moody Blue Cheese (this one we saved for later) and the Saucisson Alsacienne: Bacon Sausage with Creme Fraiche, Caramelized Onions and Tomme de Savoie Cheese (another reheat for later). Our total bill came to roughly $60 dollars. My only wish is that Hot Doug's wasn't such a far drive. Thanks again Doug!
