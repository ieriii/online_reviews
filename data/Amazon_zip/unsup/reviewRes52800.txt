It was our 2nd attempt to eat there. One star less for the 1st attempt when we were totally ignored by the waitress who set a group of 4 behind us right away and for 2 of us there was a waiting time of 30 minutes so we walked away.. I guess 2 is not as good as 4! 2nd time was great although we booked the table in advanced. Service was great - very attentive. Food delicious. We started with Empanadas: cguava & cheese, chorizo, ropa vieja, For main course my husband ordered Puerco Rostizado - very juicy and flavorful and I went with Ropa Vieja that I really enjoyed although was missing a bit of juiciness. Dessert - full but curious - coconut flan - delicious. Most of our dishes were suggested by the waitress and we need to thank her for that! BYOB - you cannot go wrong with it. We got a bucket full of ice for our beer to keep it cold! Love that!!!
