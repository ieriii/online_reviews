Okay, so, don't tell anyone, but this place is basically the reason my hubby and I moved to Chicago. We were looking for a place to fit in. A place where chubby vegans belong -- and here it is, The Chicago Diner. Get the Halfpipe, thank me later. How many other vegans thought they'd said goodbye to greasy diner food? Milkshakes? But lo and behold! This place rocks my socks off every time. I have dreams about the gyros. I crave the savory sandwiches fortnightly. That chocolate chip cookie dough and peanut butter shake is the food of the gods. And it's not just greasy diner food. Their weekly specials, salads, and the rest of the menu reflect a diverse culinary journey. I just can't say enough good things about this place. Oh, except the dining room is too small. In warm weather it's okay because they have a lovely patio, but otherwise it can get cramped at peak hours. Still, totally worth it. I love you, Chicago Diner.
