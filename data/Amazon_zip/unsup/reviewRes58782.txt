Opart Thai House is a restaurant that is near where I live, however I have never gone there, it always looked really fancy when I walked past and I thought it wasn't really the place for me. One day I went in with a couple of friends and it is a very nice place but it is also casual. It is a fabulous place to go when looking for quality Thai food. They have so many options at Opart that it is sometimes tough to choose something. One of my favorite dishes though is the Woon Sen Pad Thai. I have always been a sucker for Pad in general so I decided to try something a little different. It is not very much different; basically it is thinner noodles and a few more vegetables. It is definitely something that if you would like to stick to Pad Thai but want to change it up you should get. This is a great place to go both on a date but even just with a few friends.
