the steaks are great but i'm giving this place two stars because of the lack of service. went a few weeks ago and boy are the bartenders S L O W. slow as molasses and don't listen very well. first it took them a half an hour to get to me while i was standing directly front and center of the bar. he had some guy's margaritas just sitting and getting watered down before actually pouring them. then another guy asks to keep his tab open, but then closes it. and an elderly couple was still waiting for their wine. it had been a very long time since i was there last, actually, when they first opened across the street from the current one  i recall their empanadas to be the best i had ever eaten but was disappointed to find they had completely changed them. oh well. i'll give it another go sometime just for that steak i had. but overall, meh.
