The owner of Big Jones wrote me and asked me to take down my review.. out of respect for the fact that I did not eat there, I took it down, I emailed him back with my thoughts, which went unanswered. It is nice to know that Yelp can make a difference. Here is the review I took down: (now back) I admit, I am a sucker for advertising, and although technically speaking this was not an ad, but the Hungry Hound stopped by Big Jones for lunch and sold me on the fried chicken. The Hungry Hound on ABC7 loves every where he goes, nothing is ever negative with Steve Dolinsky. OK, I get that. My mistake, was going there for dinner and hoping for that same fried chicken as seen on TV....IT IS NOT ON THE DINNER MENU. That's me bad, for not looking on line before making my way into Andersonville to enjoy what looked to be pretty good. For a so called Southern place....the prices were downtown Chicago. The least expensive thing on the menu was a 14 dollar hamburger. I walked out. I wanted the chicken, no chicken. No me. (that was the review from last week) Now...the owner pointed out to me, they have 3 items on their menu for 12 dollars, including a bowl of gumbo. Sorry, I missed that!~ A friend of mine was at Big Jones and told me he had the 3 piece rabbit dinner. He said the pieces were small (tiny bunny) that he got 4 pieces and it was one of the best meals he ever had. I asked the owner, again about his chicken!~ My question was, "If you come here for lunch, and you order the fixed price 16 dollar chicken dinner, do you have to have at least 2 people at the table order this?" I contend, if your fried chicken is as good as ABC7 reported on, without making clear it was only a lunch item, why not adjust your menu, make a four piece or two piece dinner entree?
