I registered here specifically to review Nana, and I can describe my Nana experience in just one word. FANTABULOUS! But, I'll go further. A friend recommended that I visit Nana, since she loved it, so I did and I'm glad that I did. Met some friends from out of town this past week and we all had a wonderful time. I loved the decor, I loved the service and I absolutely loved the food. Everything was fresh. The waitress knew the dishes and the ingredients just perfectly.  I will be going back for sure. Thanks Nana...you guys rock!
