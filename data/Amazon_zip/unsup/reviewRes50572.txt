So Good! I had the fried green tomato sandwich, just to give fried green tomatoes a try because I've never had them before and it was way better than expected. The sandwich came with a tangy relish and spicy mayo that complemented the fried tomatoes well. The pulled pork sandwich that my husband had was tender and juicy. As sides we had the fried okra and mac and cheese, both excellent. Would recommend to anyone.
