I love love love the tacos de sabinas. They are so good! I find myself craving them regularly. Since I live in the burbs, it's hard to venture out and order anything else on the menu. Sometimes the line is long, but it moves quickly. I always order the horchata to cool down the heat. Very reasonable prices for good, authentic Mexican!
