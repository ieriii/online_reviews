Love, pure love - that is all I have for Spacca Napoli. Nothing I could write could convey just how fantastic this place is. Hands down - THE best pizza place outside of Italy.  I found out about Spacca Napoli when I was still in school and Chef Goldsmith came to speak in my Food and Beverage class. I was immediately in love with his story of Italy and how he started Spacca Napoli and all that he has put into it. I went and checked it out with my friend the summer of 2008 and I have never stopped going back. I went again a few weeks ago and they had the burrata appetizer as a special...I was in heaven. It was super fresh and was served warm with a light sprinkling of salt over the top with fresh out of the oven toast. I wish I had some now. Both the red and white pizzas are amazing - my favorites are the Bufalina and the Bianco Nero. I didn't think I'd like the Bianco Nero as I am not the biggest fan of truffles or mushrooms, but this pizza was divine.  Whenever I miss Italy, I come to Spacca Napoli. My favorite time to go is in the summer to sit on the patio, enjoy the quiet neighborhood, the great food, and the wine. I am always bringing new friends here and recommend it to anyone and everyone who is looking for a new pizza place. It is definitely THE best pizza in Chicago!
