Tank is literally the corner restaurant that is always packed!!! Therefore, as we drove past it, it presented the perfect opportunity for my husband and I to walk in, get seated right away on a Saturday night... You will hear loudish pop music over the speakers, hopeful you can get your own table but you may need to share (not quite communal however, depends on the space, but you may need to just extend a hand and enjoy your new neighbors). Quickly, menus are placed in front of you, um.....no idea what some of these lovely Vietnamese dishes really are... As most people had large white bowls filled with noodles and steaming liquid, I chose to explore....#43 Beef noodle soup with sliced beef, well done flank, skirts flank (Perfect, delicious, and yes, you will make a mess). Slurping the fantastic noodles (very light) with the flavorful broth was honestly so wonderful. We had a couple of sodas, an appetizer and 2 # 43's...$26.00 - can't beat that!!!
