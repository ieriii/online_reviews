Very good although perhaps a little pricey if you walk in thinking tapa's. The restaurant space is well done although if enter through the hotel it feels as if you are using a staff entrance. There is definitely a little excess in staff activity; however everyone was pleasant and prompt and attentive to my wife's food allergies. We tried the tasting menu, which probably contributed to the cost however seemed the best way to really get a feel for what they were serving. Some of the most memorable things, the salad w/ bacon and prosciutto (salty but good), the lamb, tuna,and spicy shrimp. Sitting here writing this is exciting me to go back so I guess get on over there and try it!
