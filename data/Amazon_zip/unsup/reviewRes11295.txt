Weekend brunch got back! The silver lining about a rather boring Halloween party the night before was that I was up early enough to make it to Wicker park on Sun morning, beating the other revelers to the start of the line for the Bongo Room. It turned out to be only a 30 minute wait and that was comfortably spent gazing at the cute bakeries and restaurants that stud the stretch of Milwaukee avenue. Got back to the Bongo Room in time to snag a perfect spot by the window and kick off a nice Sun brunch. The Chocolate French toast was a leading contender until I saw it actually being brought out for another table and the thing was humongous! With no chance of sharing something that rich with my friend, I decided to step it down a notch and picked another delicious seasonal french toast with praline cream, caramelized pears and pecans - it was rich but ridiculously good! The menu at the Bongo Room isn't as extensive as what you might get in some other places in the city but seasonal faves done fabulously well more than compensates for the somewhat limited choice. Add to that a comfortable, friendly, bustling environ and a friendly staff - it definitely makes for a pleasant way to start a weekend afternoon.
