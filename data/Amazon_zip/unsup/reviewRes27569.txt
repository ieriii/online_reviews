Fantastic food that lives up to the hype. If you haven't been here: go. I've eaten here three times and I've never had a bad meal, nay, a bad dish. On my most recent visit, I got the sweetbreads and sturgeon and my girlfriend got the Caesar salad and beef stroganoff. Dreamsicle and pumpkin spice cake for dessert. All of it knockouts, but that sturgeon was unbelievable.  Get it, get it, get it. This is a place that's known for reinventing this and putting a twist on that. Sometimes that seems gimmicky but he really pulls it off. The service was fantastic. The server accidentally mis-entered my GF's dessert and the wrong thing got brought out. They profusely apologized, brought us the right thing and comped us the dessert, even though we didn't ask for them to do it.
