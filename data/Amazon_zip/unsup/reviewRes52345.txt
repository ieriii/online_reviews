Sooooo Salllltyyyyy. Im not a native so I don't really know what a deep dish is supposed to be but the Pizza from Gino's looked mushy as stated above, tasted good, but was so Salty that you will regret eating later. The minestrone tastes like mash potatoes though which was kinda cool... but ya know not minestrone. Overall I gave 3 stars cause it is what it is, middle level chain food. Just thought from the reviews that it was different guess not.
