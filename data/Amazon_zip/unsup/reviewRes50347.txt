This swanky lil sports bar is pretty nice. Decided to check it out after hearing about it on TV and driving past it. Their chicken nachos are PHENOMENAL! HmMm so soo good! Didn't check out the upstairs but could see it from where I was sitting. Has 3 floors so the place is huge. Outside patio is a plus. Da service was GREAT. Had about 3 or 4 different people that worked there come around and ask how everything was. I love that. I definitely see myself going back durrng the summer and hangin out outside and eating some great nachos =)
