EXPENSIVE! BUT... AMAZING!! And I rarely give five stars to Indian places in the U.S.! But as another reviewer rightly said, this is the only place I wouldn't be embarrassed to take another Indian person to- the ambiance is quite nice and the wine and beer list is very wide and varied too- including Indian beers as well...(Kingfisher, anyone?) I live and die by their naan and paneer makhani, and their chaat/Bombay street fare selection is surprisingly good too! The specialty here, however, really is their Mughlai food. Even more shocking? Their buffet is magnificent as well! An Indian restaurant with a good buffet, is that even possible, you ask? Well, at India House, it is! Save room for their mango sorbet and gulab jamun- they're really very good! For the nonvegetarians, the sizzling chicken tikka included in the buffet meal is a sweet deal, but honestly, they need to either include paneer tikka for the vegetarians, or take the price down a couple of dollars, because that just seems unfair to me! Their servers have always been decent to me, and the hostness always says hi (now that she's seen me every few weeks!). I looooooove India House and in my very humble opinion, it's the only Indian place in the city worth eating at! The place does get pretty packed though, so I do recommend reservations- but they seem to still have a wait after making reservations, so I'm not sure what's going on there. I recommend carry-out from this place though- the CEO delivery service really charges an arm and a leg, on top of the already steep meal prices. You *will* be emptying your wallet here, so be careful, but if there is only time you can eat Indian food in the city, this really, really, should be it.
