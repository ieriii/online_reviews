A good restaurant has delicious food. A great restaurant has that + good service. A superior restaurant (warranting a four-star status with the Trib and many other accolades) is one in which food, service and atmosphere combine to create a memorable experience. Tru is one of these rare superior restaurants. My husband and I celebrated our first wedding anniversary at Tru with the 9-course tasting menu. The insanely creative and whimsical menu items played with unusual texture, flavor and presentation combinations. We continued to be surprised through each course from the array of river salmon served in a platter mimicking a rushing river with the use of dry ice to the humorous miniature monkey statues garnering our tiny desserts. And, the sophisticated art gallery decor of the restaurant paired well with the food because our plates were honestly works of art in themselves. (Although, one negative would be that it felt a bit superfluous at times. One example of this is the fruit leather hanging on clothes lines - It seemed to be an exaggerated response to what could really be comparable to a lunchbox fruit snack.) In the end, Tru is the most expensive and extravagant restaurant my husband and I had ever set foot in, yet we did not feel out of place, rushed or looked down upon like we have felt in the past at other ritzy restaurants. We were able to take our time, enjoying every tasty bite while joking with our servers. We received additional surprise special treatment with a personalized menu in the beginning of our meal and a celebratory cupcake in honor of our anniversary at the end. For one night, we were able to live like royalty. It is a meal we will hold close to our hearts.
