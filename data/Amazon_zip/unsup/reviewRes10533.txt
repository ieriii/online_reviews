Recently dined at Piccolo Sogno for a friend's birthday and had a fabulous evening! We were seated out on the patio, an the ambiance was wonderful. Our amazing waiter recommended 2 great bottles of wine, and was very knowledgeable about the menu. Every entree we ordered was really good, and we all ended up passing around all of our plates so that we could all try each other's food. Can't wait to go back again!
