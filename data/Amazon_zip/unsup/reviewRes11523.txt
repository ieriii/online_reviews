Good food, but pricey and possibly not worth a long wait. I went here on a weekday, so I was able to sit down right away. The food is good, but mostly because the dishes are rich, sweet desserts masked as breakfast food. So if you have time and aren't on a diet, by all means go. The place seems to have established itself as a scene, like Ti-Couz in SF or Flying Biscuit in Atlanta, so bring friends or a book if you're going to go on a weekend.
