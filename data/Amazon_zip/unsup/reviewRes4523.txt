I lived in Uptown all my life and finally got a chance to go in. I love jazz but you can never see me listening to it in my car, so them actually playing and playing it live is a positive. I love the fact that Al Capone use to hang out here too so I can get in touch with my gangsta side... Kidding. Overall, I like the laid back atmosphere but it's not for everyone because I had a friend who enjoyed Uptown Lounge a lot better. I can say that I like what both have to offer so Voila!
