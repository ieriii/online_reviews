Going to keep this short and sweet. We decided on the tasting menu, because we couldn't make up our mind with what to choose, and:OHMY GOD. Best meal of my entire life. Bacon wrapped dates, croquettes, and everything else on the menu was phenominal. Would recommend this place in a heart beat. Wish they would open this in NYC
