Went for an anniversary date. It's expensive but definitely worth it. Good wine selection and an amazing-AMAZING-salad bar. The atmosphere is entertaining and comfortable for an upscale restaurant (men running around with meat sticks, women acrobats in the wine cellar). The meat was delicious. Be careful not to over eat because there are a ton of options and you'll be sad if you miss out on something great that comes by later. Price is worth the experience.
