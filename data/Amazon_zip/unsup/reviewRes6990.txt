I've had several of my friends rave about this place, so I took my girlfriend here for a special night out. Unfortunately, I was not impressed. Seeing the mass quantity of positive Yelp! reviews, along with the recommendation by close friends, I am leaning toward blaming myself for a poor order here (which leads to my negative review. I ordered the fish special--which was seared tuna. Apparently I should have ordered pasta. The first thing that turned me off on the dish was the ugly gray color, paired with the pale yellow potatoes--it was not visually appealing, to say the least. I still ate the fish, which was OK, but it left me longing for a LOT more. My girlfriend ordered the pesto gnocchi, which she liked, but we both agreed that it needed more--is it too "American" of me to say that it needed some type of creamy sauce on it?? The table next to us ordered some delicious looking pasta dishes, which I was lusting after my entire meal. The one GREAT part of our meal was the asparagus salad that we split. It was mixed greens with cooked asparagus, cherry tomatoes and goat cheese with lemon. If you are looking for a light appetizer, I'd HIGHLY recommend this dish. While I'm sure that Sapori typically serves up some great food, maybe it just wasn't the "special" place I had in mind for that night.
