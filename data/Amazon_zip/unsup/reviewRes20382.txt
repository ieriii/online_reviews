Update: Back for a second visit on a Thursday night, and I love this place more than ever. I branched out and tried a specialty roll that included Japanese squash. Sounds gross, right? False. It was wonderous. I can't remember what it was called, so I'm dubbing it the "Slutty Pumpkin." I also tried the crab cake appetizer, which was more like fried crab inside a fried wonton. Again, sounds a bit revolting, no? Somehow Coast makes it great. The Po' Boy is still delicious, and so huge that it's hard to eat without looking like a glutton. I would caution you that this is not a spot for a quick bite. Things move rather leisurely so be prepared for that. Also, I tried the fresh wasabi this time around, at the request of some self-described foodies, and as I predicted, I could not tell the difference. But hey at least I seemed more worldly.
