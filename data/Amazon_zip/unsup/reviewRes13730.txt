The potato pancakes at this place make me smile so widely that my cheeks hurt. Delicious cheap breakfast and down-to-earth atmosphere. Who doesn't enjoy reminiscing about favorite childhood cereals while savoring a delectable adult brunch with great coffee? Try the scrambled eggs with fresh parmesan and chives. Four and a half stars only because the service can be iffy.
