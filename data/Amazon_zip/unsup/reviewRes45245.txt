After several attempts to get a table on a number of Saturday nights, Anteprima managed to squeeze me and my friend in at 6:30 for dinner (my preferred time is 7:30 to 9:30) this past Saturday. Upon arriving, we were seated immediately and our server was courteous, swift and helpful. We shared a 1st course of mussels and it was absolutely delicious. For the main course I had the lamb chops and my friend had the wide noodles with boar meat. Both were good, but not outstanding. The wine list was good. As we were near finishing our dinner, a number of tables opened up and stayed open. I can only question why it was so difficult to get a reservation at 7:30 or later. Perhaps my expectations were raised with all the fuss over reservations here, but with so many good restaurants to select in the Andersonville neighborhood, it is doubtful that I'll return to this one.
