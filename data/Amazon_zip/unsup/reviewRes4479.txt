just got kicked out because my friend and i were allegedly to loud ! WTF I have never been kicked out of a place because i was  too loud..we got shooooshed by the manager lookin lady during the live music , which was  on the far end of the bar...and the door guy promptly came down after to escort us to the door!  My overall review? Cool old school place, cool cocktail glasses, limited tap beer selection, bartender wished he was somewhere else. Tried to buy him a shot, and he did not bite, or lighten up about his miserable life which is the same one i share.....however i enjoy my job. The music was good , but by no means do i think we should have been kicked out because we were loud,, bottom line, someone did not like us and i do not know why???
