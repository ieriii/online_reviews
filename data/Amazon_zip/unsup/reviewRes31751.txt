I had dinner with girlfriends on a Friday night. All of us are south- or southwest-siders, so it was great to have a restaurant of this caliber close by. Nana had just started serving dinner, and was a tiny bit off their game as they ramp up. Someone forgot to flip the window sign from closed to open, which sent a bit of a "ok, now where to eat" scare into us. They were out of lemonade, and hadn't printed new menus to reflect a change in one of the seasonal entrees. That aside, the service was pleasant and food good. I had the fig Caprese salad for starters (fantastic) from the standard side of the menu, and a perch entree (slightly too salty) from the seasonal dinner menu. For dessert, we did the table service of little bites. Good, but I think I'd pefer a single dessert of one thing next time. What I like is that this restaurant would be ostentatious in a gentrified north side neighborhood, but came off relaxed and hip somehow in Bridgeport. The interior space is beautiful, lofty and clean lines. Would be a great date spot.
