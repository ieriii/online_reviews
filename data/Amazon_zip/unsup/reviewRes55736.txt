I used to eat hear frequently in the 80's/90's and felt it was one of the best kept secrets in the city. The last few times I have been there it has been too busy (usually special occasions i.e. Valentine's, Father's Day etc.), so many not be that way on normal days. The portions had gotten very small and may have lost a little luster in taste.
