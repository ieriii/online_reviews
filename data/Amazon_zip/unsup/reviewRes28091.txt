Nuevo Leon is my new obsession! First time I went there was because it smelled so good when I drove by. I knew it be good when I started chatting with an elderly lady in line waiting to be seated and she told me she comes there with her family at least once a week and has a favorite table there. The menu is huge! The prices are really reasonable and you get a red salsa, green salsa, and pickled carrots with jalapenos with your meal. I'm not adventurous enough to try something like menudo (soup made of cow stomach just doesn't sound that appealing). All the steak and chicken dishes I've tried have been so flavorful. The service has always been great too; though, I've only been there on the weekends.
