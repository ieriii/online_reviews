I am in love with Crisp!! :) Order the fried chicken with seoul sassy sauce! And the big buddha! Or any of the buddha's. Love this place! It is tiny on the inside and is mostly first come first serve seating. I suggest you have an early dinner here if you'd like a seat. Again, keep in mind this is Korean fusion food.
