It was a cigarette worthy meal... Revolution Brewing... Last Saturday... I like beer. I like food. I like beer. I like beer. I like beer. Give me a menu of house microbrews and local/regional/sustainable fare and I LOVE BEER and I LOVE FOOD!  I LOVE the Workingman Mild, the Eugene Porter, the Cross of Gold, and the Anti-Hero IPA! I especially LOVE the Anti-Hero IPA! I LOVE the bacon fat popcorn, the Workingman burger, and the pork chops! I saw the Beluga lentils and the beef stew and I'm pretty sure I'd LOVE those too. I LOVE the space. The bar is front and center with big revolution fists in the middle. There are barrel band light fixtures. The elevated dining area is separated from the bar by a wall of barrels (well, strips of barrels) There is a large window in the back of the dining room to observe the brewing process. There is ample but separate waiting space away from the dining tables, so rare for a brewpub, and so nice for dining. Yeah, I can't say anything bad. I'm in LOVE!
