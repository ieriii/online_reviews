It's been long enough since we had our memorable dining experience at Alinea. Since I've been traveling I didn't want to just throw thoughts on a page. However, I doubt I can add much to the world of Alinea experiences already well documented. After hearing from everyone else, I discovered for myself why everyone calls Alinea "an experience." It's a magic show with food; a cirque du soleil tableside. You might not enjoy the flavors of every course presented (I had a few...), but the experience trumps all. A stop at Alinea is a must for any serious foodie, food lover or people that simply enjoy being wowed. And surprisingly, the value is remarkable. For the amount of time, the number of courses, the quality of service and above all, the quality of the food, you walk out feeling like you got your money's worth. There are more pictures and my review continues at my blog.
