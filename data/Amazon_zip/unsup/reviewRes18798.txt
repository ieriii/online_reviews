This place was real good. I was impressed with their beer list because they had a lot of unique, local beers- Half Acre, of course, and even Metropolitan! My girlfriend had the veggie burger, which was alright. It was really dry. She said she wouldn't order it again but she appreciated the effort (sincerely- it was a homemade patty instead of a frozen Gardenburger). For the first time ever I ate a burger and enjoyed the meat more than the toppings. It was insane. That hunk of meat and I were good pals. Fries were awesome. Second time I came here my friend thought his burger was overdone and the "seasoned" fries are kind of a rip off. 75 cents extra for curry or chipotle fries. What you actually get is a sprinkle of curry or chipotle powder. Our server was nice, it was quiet and empty when we came in. I'll definitely be back.
