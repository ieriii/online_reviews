I don't know guys--- maybe we ordered poorly? I want to take some accountability for this subpar meal as I've seen the overwhelming number of positive reviews from people I respect. The staff is super nice- which is always a big plus. However, the food we ordered really didn't deliver. The presentations were beautiful and I feel like a 3 course meal in a restaurant of this level of prestige for $60/person is a strong value. The first thing I would advise against is the beef as the first course. It's a big RAW (no I'm not exaggerating) piece of thin beef wrapped around a trout salad. It wasn't awful but the beef/fish combination tasted a little funny, and I'm quite certain this is what lead to my vomiting throughout the movie we saw after dinner. My wife got the crab for her first dish- it was OK but not great- crab was lightly fried with the shell on- didn't really pop. For the second course I got the rabbit- the highlight of the meal were the white truffle fingerling potatoes--- now this was what I expected from Sprout! Absolutely delicious- Rabbit was just OK- kind of dry, not a ton of flavor. My wife had the pork- it was very rare- I didn't think you were supposed to eat pork rare, but I assumed if they were serving that way it was... not very good either way. The desserts were fine, we had the berries and the corn. The berries were the better of the two, but neither were great. Very sorry to write this review as we had been waiting to go to Sprout for so long! Perhaps if we had ordered the short rib and the foie gras per the recommendations of other this would have went differently.
