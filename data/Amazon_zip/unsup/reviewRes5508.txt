If you are looking for a fun ambience and don't mind a wait, I recommend Purple Pig! However, the food didn't quite live up to my expectation - maybe because of how much hype the place has gotten. We had a cheese plate (delicious, I admit), then the pig's ear (moderate... not my favorite), the milk-braised pork shoulder (good texture but I wasn't crazy about the milk taste), and the s'mores sandwich for dessert (a big portion but definitely a fun way to wrap up the meal). I had a great glass of tempernillo that one of the awesome bartenders selected for me. Overall I would definitely go again, but more for the fun experience than for the actual food.
