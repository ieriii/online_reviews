People have raved enough about the beer offerings, so let me just say that I love everything about this place before 8pm and everything but the hour wait for a table after 8pm. The mussels and fries with aioli are phenom. The aioli will give you garlic breath for an entire day after, but so worth it. Cheerful vibe, good service, fun neighborhood. It gets crowded, but not in an obnoxious way. Good for couples and groups. If you can score a table in the upstairs area, even better!
