Other than the price of the food, this place is perfection. It has a great atmosphere, a commitment to our environment, live music, and amazing food. The "whoopee pie" is a must. It has sugar cookies and carrot gelato. We also had some sort of pear tart that was nearly as incredible.If you are looking for great organic fine dining, Uncommon ground is the place to be in Chicago.
