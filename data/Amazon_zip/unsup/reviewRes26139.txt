I was skeptical to say the least. If you equate romance to small dark caves, this place is the hands-down winner. And our table was also the size of a checkerboard. Seemed about a 20% chance that the pot of boiling whatever would end up getting knocked over at some point during the night. But when the pot of melted cheese came out, it was game over -- that stuff was amazing. I could eat apples covered in cheese all day and night. The main pot for meats and vegetables and the chocolate pot for dessert were both solid as well. Add a bottle of their well-priced house wine for a good evening. However, the place is pricey. If it ain't an anniversary, come during Restaurant Week.
