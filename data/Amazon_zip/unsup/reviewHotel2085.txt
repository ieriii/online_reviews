I was impressed with the view and the room. The wireless internet signal is weak in some places, but I eventually got it working (it could be better). There is a nice lounge/bar in the hotel, and it's within walking distance of several shops and places to eat. It's easy to get to a train from the Merchandise Mart by way of the hotel.
