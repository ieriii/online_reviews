this place is very cool. the wings are tasty and big. i had the seoul sassy and bbq. these flavors are pretty unique when compared to wingstop, buff joes, or bww. other people were getting the bowls which i thing are also great but i havent tried it. overall these wings are pretty good and bigger than other places that sell wings. parking can be a hassle, what else is new in lakeview. the seating is limited with a community style seating arrangement and some seating at the wall. the employees are cool too. i recommend.
