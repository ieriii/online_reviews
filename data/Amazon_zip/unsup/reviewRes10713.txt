Great pizza and great beer, so this should be five stars, right? Hardly. The first couple of times I went the service was unreliable. The last time I went, the waitress lost my credit card and then she and the manager blamed me, saying I had never given it to her! After she searched for a very stressful hour she found my card in her pocket, where I kept telling her it was. The very next week, my best friend was there in a band as entertainment for their employee holiday party. The restaurant was closed to the public. When he went to leave, he noticed that his bag with instruments and lyric book was gone. As it turned out, one of the employees there stole it. Very nice. So, the pizza is good, and the homemade beer is great, but ladies and gentlemen watch your valuables around the employees of Piece.
