My favorite thin crust pizza in the city...next to Pequod's. The one thing that puts it over for me is that eating pizza at Piece is more of an "experience." It's a ton of fun, especially if you go on a night when they are hosting karaoke or there's a big game on. Their brewed beers are also pretty good. I just love the atmosphere in this place. The food is good, and for the most part, so is the service. I will say however, that I was here the other day and some skinny brunette girl came up to seat us and was completely rude. She was extremely unfriendly and once she found us a table, she just flung our menus in front of us and walked off. Despite her ill attitude, I would rather pretend this did not happen because I like this place so much. This time I'll chalk it up to "maybe she's having a bad day." Next time however, I will not be so nice.
