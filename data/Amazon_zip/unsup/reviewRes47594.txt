I loved it. I chose this for my graduation brunch from graduate school. We did the $29.00 brunch with the $3.00 mimosa's. Parking was pretty easy to find early on a saturday morning. My party had 7 people in it. The only minus which why the four stars and not 5 was that i made a reservation early and may moved it because of nato and then switched it to June. I talked to the hostess Gretchen because I needed to change the time and she assured me we would be fine and we ended up having to wait still about 30 minutes when we got there. They tried to give us the high seated tables and my aunts and parents are older they need to be as close to the ground as possible. wth So my favorite from the harvest table was the Duck Confit Hash Browns and the strawberry salad. I also ate about three red velvet cupcakes. For the entrees. I loved the chicken and waffles, the bottom sirloin, and the roasted turkey. The worst: the corned beef hash, the frittata, and the crab Benedict fell flat for me. The decor is gorg very peaceful and zen like and relaxing. There was also a noisy birthday party going on with a magician. I went up to check out the rooftop and its really cute. I would do the brunch again with less people of course. I'm going to checkout the rooftop again this weekend.
