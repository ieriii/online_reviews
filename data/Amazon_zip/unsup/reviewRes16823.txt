This place makes cocktails the way they should be made. With precise, care, and from scratch. If you care about your drink then you should go here. While I wasn't crazy about waiting in a line out the door at only 8pm, the line moved quick and I think we were seated in less than 20 minutes. And as we enjoyed our cocktails we noticed several empty seating areas, so we think they may just be keeping you wait to look busier to passerbys. In either case, don't get discouraged. We were seated by the fireplace which was warm and cozy on a February night. I really liked that a glass of water showed up before we ordered drinks, because most bars seem to hate handing water out. The menu was extensive and interesting. I had the red moon fizz which was delicious and my husband had a moscow mule. We were both disappointed that Absinthe didn't seem to be on the menu as we thought this place would make some really good sazeracks, but maybe they will add it in the future. I also may see if you can order drinks not on the menu as I low gin fizzes and have had a hard time finding a bar that does them correctly. In either case, this is a great place to go if you are looking for a classy cocktail or pre-dinner drink.
