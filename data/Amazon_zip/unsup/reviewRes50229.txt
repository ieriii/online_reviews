IGNORE THE HIPSTER HATERS!! If you read every negative thing about this place notice it has nothing to do with the place itself! Yes, the place has a few plasmas but is not a sports bar. Amazing bar staff, hostess etc. You're more likely to find people mixing and having fun with each other than watching the TV's. The food in the place is amazing - hence the hot towel-worthy follow-up! They hired an actual chef to design the menu and run the kitchen. You won't find a better steak sandwhich or burger in this price range. On weekends it is definitely crowded but actually one of the more diverse spots in a neighboorhood supposedly known to be diverse (except for those other reviewers that hate anywhere without a dirty bathroom and angry 30 somethings hence their desire to keep going to Rainbow). This is the kind of place you can bring your parents to for some upscale bar food and then send them home for the bar scene.
