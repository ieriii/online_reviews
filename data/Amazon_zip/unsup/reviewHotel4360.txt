The lobby is gorgeous and was beautifully decorated for the holiday season. great location, central to many things and easy to get around on foot. you have to pay for parking, which is about $20 a nite, which adds up. the hotel rooms arent as grand as the outside of the hotel. the first nite, we had problems with the bathroom sink. but the beds are comfy. there's a starbucks down below.
