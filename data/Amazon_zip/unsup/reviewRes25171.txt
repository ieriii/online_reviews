I love this place so much that my classmates & I did a food related research project in college. Totally going off on a tangent... back to the good stuff~ Such a warm & inviting place & back in college, it was conveniently close and easily accessible from campus. I love the owner there..I believe he's a tall, skinny fella w/glasses. Always has a huge grin on his face, greets us with such enthusiasm every time I stop by.  Their prices are decent and the first thing that catches my eye is the decadent dessert area. I've tried multiple items, from tiramisu, chocolate mousse cakes, stwberry shortcake, baklava, & list goes on and on. They are deliciously made, made with finest ingredients, and not overly sweet. I've tried couple items on their menu list.. chicken lemon rice soup is fantastic! Such a bizarre & phenomenal blend of ingredients. Refreshing and hearty, great for summer time and winter time. It's a win-win! Espresso and turkish coffee is a plus if you're in need for a caffeine kick. Servers are decent...I've had good and bad service at times.  I really love this place b/c it has such an elegant and warm ambiance right in the heart of Greektown.
