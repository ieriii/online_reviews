I don't care for Mexican food. THERE! I said it! Crucify me. Despite this, I'll settle for some Mexican every once and a while, and this seemed to be the place to go while I showed my father around Pilsen. The restaurant is vibrantly painted on the outside and is definitely an attention getter. On the inside, it is packed, and the menu is chock full of everything and anything Mexican. The first item on our table was a free appetizer of braised ox-tail. EXCELLENT! I ordered a steak kebob with refried beans, rice and guacamole. My father ordered another steak item.  Both were really good and tasty with a vast amount of flavor. For the first time in my life, everything tasted homemade, even the refried beans which usually come from a can. We then shared flan for dessert and headed along our merry way around Pilsen. Excellent food, service and environment. Nuevo Leon actually made me like Mexican food. I definitely would not hesitate to come back!
