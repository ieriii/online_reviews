Went there before 5 at the spur of the moment for some carry out. I believe I was the only one there. Place looks awesome, kitchen impressive and despite what I heard about the service - the guy at the register was most helpful. But then again, it was pre-dinner. I thought I'd go with something simple and as I was already impressed with the ambiance I thought I'd upgrade the next time around. So I went with the Margherita, simple. Take a look at the picture John C. took. My pizza had 1/3 to 1/2 the cheese, and while the sauce was very tasty, there wasn't much to make up for the lack of cheese. I could see where this could have been really good, the potential was there. I am not trying to be insulting, but had my 16 year old been there - he would have said Pizza Hut is better. In this case I wouldn't have much to defend. I ate almost all the pizza except for one slice where I would have only eaten half. Why, because reheating it would have only reminded me of how bad and overpriced it was. Two stars because of the interior, but I had carry out.
