I love coming to this place. I had actually been here before when it used to be a tapas bar .... and I must say it only got better. The food is to die for ... for anyone who likes waffle fries you HAVE to try them. The burgers are great too, try the "triple secret" I'm telling you, you won't regret it. But one of the best parts of the bar is ..... THE FORTY OUNCERS. What screams "class" more than a brown paper bag and a huge bottle of beer. If you don't get a kick outta that then I probably don't wanna hang out with you. I'm pretty harsh in these reviews. but this place is legitimately awesome.
