This is the definitive Chicago deep dish pizza. Lou Malnati's is a close second, with Uno's and Due's tied for third depending on how many tourists you have to claw through to get a seat. There's nothing I can say that hasn't already been said before. If you're going to see a movie at the theater across the street, give yourself about two hours to come here and get a delicious dinner beforehand.
