Ok, I am not a hot dog person. And, while driving by here the lad and I had just come from a party where we'd already eaten. But for the awesome retro nostalgia factor alone we had to swing in and check it out. Everyone (even if you are not from Chicago) has seen that famous Tarzan hot dog statue somewhere (probably on the Food Network these days), and yes, it is even more thrilling in person! The kitschy sculptures are augmented by neon ahoy and tiny renderings of the two 'dogs (pardon me, dawgs) on the end caps of the carports. Parking was crowded beyond belief, not just due to the number of cars but also the arrangement of spaces; I'm sure they're trying to get the maximum number into this comparatively small space, but it's like the proverbial sardine can, and getting out can be tricky. As to our order, I just got a pineapple shake, which was actually pretty disappointing: it basically tasted like vanilla with some little pineapple chunks in there, but the flavor was not integrated at all, and hard to suck the bits through a straw (though I had asked for the "thinned down" version, as per the menu sign suggestion, if you want to be able to drink vs. spoon it). They definitely have the branding down, you can buy tshirts, postcards and even a baby onesie, as well as a plethora of other souvenir paraphernalia as you order your dawg and drink. Now that I've stopped in, I don't think I need to return (it's far from home), but hot dog heads may disagree. Judging by the number of reviews here, Superdawg just may be king of the hot dog jungle.
