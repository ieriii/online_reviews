This place is the kind of magnificent little hole in the wall joint that you just get giddy about finding. Cramped, yes. Loud, also. Delicious, moderately priced, friendly, huge helpings, and super charming? Check, and check. Went here for Valentine's Day and were probably the only people under 30 in there, but maybe that's just the way we roll. We loved it. Every entree comes with a soup and a salad, not to mention the giant loaf of bread AND pizza bread that they serve up while you're waiting for the real food to come. I could have just eaten that pizza bread all night and been perfectly satisfied. So good. Also our waiter was incredibly friendly and quick on his feet despite the place being packed to the gills. If you live nearby, you have to try it at least once.
