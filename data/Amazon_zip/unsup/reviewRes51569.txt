I've been to Garcia's several times. Decent mexican food for slightly up-market prices. The tacos are excellent, and the tamales are meh... However, Garcia's location on Western Ave, and late hours make it an easy to place to grab a quick meal.  Lastly, their renovation has make the place cleaner and more palatable. If you want a fairly standard, utilitarian Mexican restaurant in Lincoln Square, Garcia's is a good place to eat. On the other hand, if you're going out for dinner and want really top-notch Mexican food, try Los Napoles down the street.
