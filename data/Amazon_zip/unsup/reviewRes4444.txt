love this place. sucks that they have a cover most nights but the music is top notch. I'm a music ed major and seeing these performers leaves me in awe every time. I want to check out the poetry slam on Sundays. I like this place a lot. Unfortunately most of my friends are dead beats and only listen to punk rock so it's rough getting somebody to accompany me. Heard Al Capone used to hang out here also. I've never been able to get a booth at this place. First time I went I had to stand , second time I went I sat at the bar, third time I got to sit in a chair. Maybe 4th time will be booth night. It's a very nice place. When I've gone, the covers been around $15 . Classy place for dates.
