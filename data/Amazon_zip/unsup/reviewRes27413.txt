get a reservation! it was an hour or more wait! we ended up not having to wait for the bar but most people do. food is amazing! i went for brunch. i got omelet with with steak and eggs. it was sooo sooo soo spicy! but oh so good. my friend got tacos which were super yummy as well. GET THE CHEESE CAKE FLAN!!! it is AMAZING! margaritas are so good! & we were there for cinco de mayo so they were extra good. overall this place is really good. ..... it is on the pricey side so, only going here for special occasions.
