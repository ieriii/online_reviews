awesomeness. My girlfriend loved the whoopskidawg. I like the onion chips. The superdawg is very filling nestled in there with its fries. i almost couldn't eat 2 of them. There was a little opossum scouting the parking lot for those pickled tomatoes which everyone seems to throw out of their cars. It ate some fries i threw to it. Fun with nature! yay!
