This place was surprisingly awesome! I have to say, when my boyfriend suggested this place for our anniversary dinner....I definitely felt some uncertainty over what might happen to us that night. First of all, this is one of those places on Elston that you would probably miss if you blinked so keep your eyes peeled. The ambiance is....interesting. Some cool stained glass windows, dim lighting, and the smell of incense make you feel like you've been instantly teleported into the world's largest old school confessional. We had the saganaki for our appetizer - which was really really good (and I usually pass on saganaki). Branko, the owner, perfectly seared the top while maintaining the melty/salty/cheesy goodness inside. Our entree's were the Romanian skirt steak with carmelized onions and vegetables, and the sausage stuffed chicken - both equally delicious! We had the chocolate ganache for dessert - which was more or less a cupcake (but better than Molly's) with a scoop of chocolate gelato doused in powdered sugar and raspberry/chocolate sauce. My boyfriend had a Manhattan to drink (they are definitely don't skimp with the booze), and I had the Serbian version of a mojito - yum! If you have Eastern European parents/grandparents...you would all probably feel right at home here. The food tastes very similar to something my grandma would make at home, and the owner is definitely the life of the party. There was plenty of entertainment to go around: Elderly lady singer with accordian accompaniment, a man started choking and another patron performed the heimlich maneuver on him.... oh yes, and if that wasn't enough, Branko assisted a lady patron in throwing glasses and shouting Opa! (Apparently I need to brush up on my geography) Great value, food, service, drinks - all around great experience and I would definitely go back again. Nasdrovia!
