I hate to say that this place has good Korean food because it's apparently the best Chicago has to offer, but it really does serve good dishes. The chicken galbi is really good, though the chadol baegi is not (it's tough). I always love their kimchi jjigae, and you can't really order a bad dish, but I suppose the best thing about this Korean restaurant is all the different banchan! Plus it's open until 4 in the morning - always good for a late night meal.
