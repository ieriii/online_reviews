The beer list is very good...a lot of local choices (wine as well). Our server was very knowledgeable about the list and made appropriate recommendations based on our questions. The food wasn't stellar, but I appreciate the local ingredients and that the burgers are made with all natural beef. The atmosphere and decor was great and definitely above average. I also appreciate the intent behind the food. The menu is carefully thought out. My friend ordered a burger that was supposed to be served on an english muffin. He tried to substitute for a pretzel roll and the waitress insisted that he try the english muffin. She guaranteed that he would like it or she would take it back. She stated that the chef intended it to be served on an english muffin. He ended up loving it. You don't get a lot of waitresses at bars that insistent upon eating the food based on the chef's intentions.
