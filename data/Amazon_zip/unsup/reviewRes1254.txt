Who gave this one star? Maybe they waited too long. It doesn't matter though. I went today at around one and really only waited fifteen minutes. I got a Fire Dog (which I refuse to call Kiera Knightly, because I don't think she's hot) and the game of the week: three chili wild boar sausage with chipotle dijonnaise and smoked gouda. And it was delicious. I tried to the foie gras and duck sausage, which was also delicious. As it was my first time getting boar, I was nervous (which I shouldn't have been because I love meat) but when I ordered, Doug was very excited that I did and said "Good, because it's really delicious." And that's when I knew that I had made the right decision. The fire dog was delicious too; the fact that you can hear the casing snap is awesome. I love it for sure. I don't think there really can be anything else to be said. I'm sure you've been told to go. So go. If you don't like waiting in line, forego the weekend and skip the duck fat fries. Go at the off times. Just do it. It's delicious and well worth it.
