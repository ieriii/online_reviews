I went here for the first time with my husband today for brunch. He had been to the restaurant a few weeks earlier with some friends and could not wait to enjoy a great meal with me. OMG...the bacon was amazing! It was thick, maple-y, and by far the best part of the meal! I had the waffle which was good. I wasn't a huge fan of the raspberry jam, but that's just a personal preference. The waffle itself was unique tasting and the honey butter was pretty tasty as well. My husband was really looking forward to ordering the Schnitzel waffle again, but it wasn't on the menu. The waiter told us that it was only available on Saturdays - how disappointing. My husband enjoyed the meal he got, but I think he would've still preferred the schnitzel...could you blame him?!?!? My take away from this restaurant is order two plates of bacon a person - it wasn't big enough to be a meal and then order another side with it.
