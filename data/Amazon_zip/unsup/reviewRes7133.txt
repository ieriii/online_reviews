As I write this I feel bad for the experiences that Gary and Alan had because our lunch experience today was nothing shy of fantastic. Trying to figure out a way to go back for dinner tonight-- it was THAT good! The reviews above are accurate and well describe the experience. From our perspective, you really want to go when you are in a mood to enjoy and take your time. An upscale place, they will let you have all the time you want, so begin by enjoying the gourmet potato chips and pickles that they put on each table. Both are very good.  I highly recommend the smoked dry-rubbed chicken wings. They have outstanding smoke flavor, a great sauce, and are perfectly done. You can nearly make a meal just on these, yet the order is perfect for two people to split. Their pulled pork is fantastic and made me a fan with the first bite. It has a wonderful flavor and is very tender and juicy while having nice bits of char. This is what I'll order again next time I go---keep the menus. I also highly recommend the corn bread as an option or as your side if they ask. It is moist, creamy, sweet, and has the perfect texture. Really a nice well done item. Service is excellent and very personal. Can't wait to return!
