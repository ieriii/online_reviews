Well, what can I say that has not already been said. I've been a loyal patron of Wildfire for over 10 years. Hands down the ABSOLUTE BEST steakhouse in the state. The downtown Chicago location has the best ambiance and servers by far, but the suburban locations are fabulous as well. The Wildfire has me so spoiled, I never eat steak anywhere else because I always end up disappointed. Even if I go to a steakhouse, I order ribs or prime rib because I know the steak will not be up to par. The Stuffed Shrimp appetizer holds a special place in my heart, not much can top it. Entree - Medium Rib-Eye w/parmesan crust and a side of broccoli. All the sides are to die for, so take your pick. Regardless of your cut, be sure to ask for Parmesan Crust. I guarantee you will thank me. My bartender at Wildfire downtown is Luis (Hispanic pronunciation Lu-iz not Louis). If you pay $12 for a drink, you should get a $12 drink. With Luis, you pay $12 and get a $20 drink! He is TOP NOTCH, so you'll only need 2 drinks. Throughout the years I've eaten numerous times at Ruth's Chris, Morton's, and Gibson's - all of which have good steak, maybe even great steak. However, all are more costly and NONE have more flavor and better service than Wildfire. Can't beat that.
