eh. this place is good for cheese and wine flights, but i would pass on lunch here. especially if you need to get back to work in any sort of timely fashion. we went here for restuarant week and we were less than impressed. the service was poor and the food left most of us with upset stomaches. they ran out of the "soup of the day" before my friend even got her soup. they brought us the wrong food and were out of another main menu item before noon. boo to lunch or dinner. yay to wine and cheese!
