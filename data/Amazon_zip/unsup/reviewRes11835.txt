Ahhhhhh food coma! I'm sitting here writing this review approximately 4 hours after eating and I am still full from brunch. My friend and I ordered and shared the French Toast with Strawberries and Bananas (we got the last order!) and the BLT benedict. Wow, what a way to start a Saturday afternoon! Plus, the waitress was so attentive and we never had to ask for a refill. And they remembered my name on the way out, Now, that is service. The only downside was the wait, but that's ok as there are lots of cute shops to browse. Also, parking is horrendous but that is to be expected at that time of day in that area. All in all, amazing food and wonderful atmosphere.
