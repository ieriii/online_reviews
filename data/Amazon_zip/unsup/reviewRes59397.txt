Hella,P.T. Barnum said, "There's a sucker born every minute." Mr. T. said, "I pity the fool" if you shop here you are either very rich or what Mr. T said. I find it hard to believe any self-made rich person would so easily part with their loot, but anyway. Pambo saw dried cilantro for $18 a pound! The selection of speciality items here is impressive, but this place makes Whole Food's pricing seem fair. The butcher counter has some truely nice cuts of meat and Pambo could spend $1,000's here if Pambo had money to burn. The shoppers here are mucho less annoying than WF Lincoln Park. For every good thing here there is something sooo outragiously expensive it balances out.
