My wife isn't a strict vegetarian, but doesn't eat beef or pork. Since moving back to Chicago she's seen me eat a good share of hot dogs and confessed the other day that she kind of wished she could have one with all the fixin's. Hot Doug's veggie dog finally gave me a reason to stand in line and check the place out first hand and score some points with the wife. She, of course, went with the veggie dog and was happy to get her fix without crossing the beef/pork line, while I decided to sample the special - ostrich with strawberry dijonaise and some fancy smoked Spanish cheese that I couldn't pronounce. I like trying new things, so they can earn five starts for that alone. Good stuff. I also talked her into splitting the duck fat fries - I didn't notice anything special as far as the taste, but I did polish off the entire basket whereas I usually get bored about halfway through a bag of fries from a regular fast food joint. Sure it seems silly to wait almost an hour for hot dog and I wouldn't do it every weekend, but I'll definitely be back to sample more of the menu and support someone running a quality local business.
