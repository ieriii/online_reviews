Very cool place. The crowd is a mix of hipsters, young professionals, baby boomers, etc. but all good looking! I love the various beer selections...I thought I knew beers until I came here and got surprising and delightful eye-opening experience. Each brewery represented is unique and the flavors were all just great. I have a very refreshing light beer with a hint of lemon and then tried a chocolate-like coffee beer that was delicious too. The staff is friendly and the atmosphere is cool and refreshing. Don't forget to go for the mussel appetizers...just great! Tim W., Edgewater Beach, Chicago
