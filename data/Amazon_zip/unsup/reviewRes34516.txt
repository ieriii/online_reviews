I found this place thanks to Yelp, so first things first... thanks all! :-) Okay, on with the review... I can't say I can compare this place to any other breakfast/brunch spot in Chicago as this is the only one I visited, but I can say my experience there was quite good. The food is very fairly priced, the menu is extensive, and the taste was excellent. The whole place seems to be staffed by college students, but they do a fairly good job of controlling the masses. My only mark against it would have be the absolutely staggering crowd, and associated wait times. The waiting room on a Sunday morning around 11:30 was literally overflowing with people. The poor folks plastered in the corner between the window and the wall probably had no prayer of hearing their names called by the attractive yet softspoken hostess. Still, from what I've heard this is pretty much the case at any such establishment in Chicago, so I can't ding the place much for that. On a side note, for anyone planning on visiting the Field Museum or the Aquarium, Yolk is located a brief 10-minute walk away, just across the bridge leading to Museum Campus.
