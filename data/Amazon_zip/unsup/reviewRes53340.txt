This place truly is a chicago gem. Really one of a kind. The best place to enjoy an authentic Chicago style hot dog as well as the numerous other gourmet sausage sandwiches. I like the sauterne duck sausage topped with the truffle aioli and foie gras mousse...TO DIE FOR!! You have to try the fries fried in duck fat.
