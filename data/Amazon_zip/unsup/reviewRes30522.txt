This place is soooo charming! (with the exception of the jewelry...that threw me! Is it for sale....decoration?) The food delicious, fresh & plated pretty! (grits were my Fav) But the hi light for me was the drinks! Smart & delicious! My Nana-Rita had a hint of jalapeo & it was the BOMB!! My friend had a Stawberrry raspberry lemonade with lavender & it was equally, if not slightly better than mine! (the bartender is my new boyfriend... Someone tell him please! Jk LOL)
