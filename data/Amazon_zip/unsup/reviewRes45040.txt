Anteprima helped my boyfriend and I celebrate our 5 year anniversary together. With reservations, we got a saturday evening table. Our server was friendly, attentive and helped us make some great menu decisions. We had grilled octopus and pork sausage with white beans to start - both were 10s. My boyfriend has homemade bowtie pasta with duck, I had butternut squash ravioli - again both excellent. The smaller portions were a perfect size. They gave us a free lemon panna cotta with a candle in honor of our date! It was my favorite part of the meal - totally out of this world. I wish there was a 4.75 button! Only thing preventing me from giving this a 5? The space is tiny. Like, we could hear everything at the tables around us, even smell their dishes. As long as you really know that's what you are in for, the food is worth it. Boy is it worth it!
