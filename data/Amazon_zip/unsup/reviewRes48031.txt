Yes, this restaurant is awesome. the only Bad things: it can get a bit noisy. And although the food is top notch, the service and atmosphere would probably disqualify this establishment from ever receiving any sort of michelin star...and why would they want one? Everyone should fear the michelin man.  You should come here with people that you care about and want to share delicious food with. Because delicious food you will eat. And the world may be ending soon, so...get over here with your credit card or whatever. And eat. Amazing, fresh, spectacular oysters, excellent beer list, pretty OK wine choices, fantastic meats, a celebration of vegetables, a celebration of food. Thank you, Publican!!!!!! just go here. p.s: don't go to the club next door by mistake.
