I'll start with the good: best guacamole I've had outside of Texas. As a matter of fact, all of the food was great, filling, (this is important for those of us who "ain't ballin'") and it won't kill your wallet/purse/what-have-you. The not-so-great: the service could have been better. I've eaten here a few times and while the servers have always been nice to me they should probably roll their eyes a little less at some of the older, more pain-in-the-ass customers. Also, I've always eaten here at seemingly slow lulls in business and the service can be a tad on the slow side even when things are pretty dead. Overall, not so bad.
