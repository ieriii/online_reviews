Doug is one of the nicest guy's known to man. No one can beat his dog's!!! I'm so sad I don't live down the street on Roscoe anymore! I can't tell you how many times I've come in and he's given me a break when I've run out of cash. He also puts up with my little momma that loves to talk his ear off when he's trying to manage that massive line that wraps out the door and goes allllll the way down to the alley. Only thing that makes me sad is that he closes at 4 and I get out of work at 4:45 most days. WAHH! KEEP IT UP DOUG!!! I think your place is so unique and I forgot to mention that he plays the best music ever and has the most stylish glasses............one more thing.......he has this waitress that is one of the meanest most cold hard B***hes eve! His guy waiter is so nice and awesome though! :) You should give him a raise DOUG!
