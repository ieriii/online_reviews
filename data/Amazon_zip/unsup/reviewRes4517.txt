Ohhh, my beloved Green Mill, how I miss you now that I have returned to the East Coast! The New York jazz clubs are just too damn pricey. The Green Mill is the only place in America where you can walk in and hear world-class jazz for just $5. (The cover is sometimes $10 or $15 on weekends, for higher-profile acts, but that's still bupkes compared to the $50 cover at the comparable venues in New York). Seriously, Chicagoans-- you've got America's best jazz club right there in Uptown. Savor it!
