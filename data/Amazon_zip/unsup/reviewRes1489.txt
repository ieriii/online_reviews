Never been impressed.... Duck fat fries are forgettable, like floppy greasy  limp dinner fries. I always buckle when trying to pick my meal, so many amazing choices on paper -- unfortunately nothing yet to delivery that hot awesomeness to my mouth. Also, I've got to wonder about Anthony Bourdain. I had that same duck foie gras. I found the too rich and muddle it really lost that great delicate flavor. I'll keep going back trying to find something worth the long lines and horrible business hours. Until then 2 stars it is!
