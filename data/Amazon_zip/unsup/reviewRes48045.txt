Again, a fantastic Sunday afternoon. Gin and 'treuse... The pork belly bibimbap... pork skins lamb sausage... GRITS... and the staff... on their game! Wow, I'm so glad we got in and in retrospect, that the pork shoulder was sold out at the time of seating. I would not have ventured above otherwise, and it was outstanding. THANK YOU.
