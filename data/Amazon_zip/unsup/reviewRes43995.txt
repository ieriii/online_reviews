We went to Kinzie Chop House on a Tuesday night before the theater. The service was just ok, despite being relatively empty. The steaks were ok- mine was a little over cooked, but my husbands was much better. It was clean and the manager did stop by our table and make sure everything was alright. If you are running out of steak houses in Chicago to try, give it a shot, but I would not make it my first choice.
