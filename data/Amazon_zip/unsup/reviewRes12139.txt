Okay, so I have never had the pizza at Piece, a crime I know, but I have had some of the appetizers there and I can say that I enjoyed it thoroughly. I delighted in the taste of the spinach and artichoke dip, which was delicious, during an evening of live band karaoke. Good food, good entertainment, how could you want more?
