great during the day. if yer lucky, omar will be there. the beer and food are awesome. a little too crowded sometimes at night, and forget about weekend nights. but, if yer like me and don't have a fixed daytime schedule you would be missing out if you didn't stop in on a weekday afternoon. its a gem, although not so hidden anymore.
