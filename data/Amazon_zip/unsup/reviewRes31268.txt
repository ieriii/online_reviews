yummmmmm....one of my top 3 steakhouses! I went on the grand opening week and it was insane for reservations. I put in my reservation for the next day and when I walked in with my party they thought it was for a month from then! Who makes reservations for a party of 3 for a month in advance! I guess they were over booked and too busy to notice! I've got to the say at least the customer service was excellent. Even after they made the mistake they were able to fit us in and we only waited for 15 mins at the bar. If your in Chicago and like tantalizing melt in your mouth steak and hot friendly hosts then visit this new Mastro's!
