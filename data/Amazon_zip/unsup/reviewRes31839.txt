Wow! What a fantastic place. I had been really sick all week and for some reason when I came here, my head, nose and throat all cleared up. Maybe it was the lychee petal cocktail. We had great service and the food was amazing (we had a smorgasbord- maki, sashimi, salads, entrees, dessert and drinks). Some of my favorites were the hand rolls in rice paper, chilean sea bass, duck hash (?), garlic rice, eel on top of watermelon, the dynamite roll, oxtail dumplings and the creamed avocado, raspberry, mango dessert.... yum. Other than the great service and delicious food, the vibe was fun (a lot better than Japonais) and the sushi chefs were cute. Can't wait to go back!
