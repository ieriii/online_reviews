I've dined here multiple times, mostly brunch, twice for dinner. Pros: Great bloody Mary's, cute outdoor seating, nice indoor seating, pistachio chicken, pistachio chicken, pistachio chicken. Cons: Your brunch has upset my stomach on 3 separate occasions - NO MORE. The service is always slow. I also went with 3 girl friends and we ordered appetizers. I was disappointed with the proportions. Also, why is it always DEAD!! I agree, how can a place with this great of reviews be so empty? How are you surviving? Must be the bloodys......
