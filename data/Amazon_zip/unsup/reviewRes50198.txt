I came with a group of 7 to watch the Pens game. The entire staff was so accommodating. There wasn't room for us downstairs so they sat us upstairs right away. When we asked for the game there was an issue with the tvs but they so kindly fixed it and put the game on every tv for us. Our waitress so so nice, super helpful and all around awesome. The food was delicious, best sweet potato fries and the veggie burger was soo good. All around it was a really great experience!
