I just can't write a bad review about San Soo Gab San. I know their service isn't the friendliest. They always seem like it's such a burden to help anyone. That you better order enough meat for each person there or they'll raise hell... The food is good. It makes up for whats lacking. They have a ton of banchan which helps. People hates this place because of their service. I can see why. I've been to Korean BBQ in Cali and their servers were really friendly... I've also gone with some good friends who are Korean and it turns into a joke about the service. My one friend has to yell in Korean for the server because she was ignoring us more so then when I went without them... Just prepare yourself for that and you'll do fine.
