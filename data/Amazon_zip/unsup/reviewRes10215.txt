Went to Piece at 9 p.m. on a Friday night with 3 friends. There was quite a substatial wait and no room at the bar, so we just kind of loitered in the middle of the restaurant until a seat at the bar opened up. We ended up waiting 40 minutes for a table, which was really the only negative of my experience at Piece and I can't really blame them for being busy. I wasn't feeling 100% that night, so I stuck with water, but everyone I was with really enjoyed their beers. I would love to go back when it's less busy to sit at the bar and chat with a bartender and try some beers. We sat down and I saw they had guacamole on the menu, so I had to order it. It was actually really good, definitely made fresh. We ordered a large pizza and got half pepperoni and jalapeno and half sausage, mushroom, onion and black olive. They didn't have any pre-designed pizzas, so it was completely create your own. Even though we went with pretty standard toppings, I appreciated their wide variety of unique toppings (mashed potatoes, for example).  When we pizza came out we all gasped when we saw what we had gotten ourself into. It was huge! We actually made quite a dent in it, but had plenty to take home with us. It was really good too! A great crust and the toppings were great quality. The service was good. Nothing overly special, but no complaints. If back in Chicago, I would love to stop back in for some beer and a pie.
