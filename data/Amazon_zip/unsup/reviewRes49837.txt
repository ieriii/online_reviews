My boyfriend and I stumbled upon this place late on a Friday eve after having wandered the streets of Chicago trying to walk off the ginormous dinner we had earlier that night. We were looking for a nice glass of wine to cap off the night and hit the jackpot. We are cheese lovers (even on a full stomach) so when we discovered they had a cheese bar, we were thrilled. We bellied to the separate cheese bar and ordered a wine and cheese flight that was really good. Our server (I wish I could remember his name) was fantastic. He was incredibly knowledgeable and passionate about cheese which translated into a number of extra tastes for us. It was the perfect way to end a fun night in Chicago.  I'm hoping the cheese bar concept will take flight (pun intended) in San Francisco soon.
