How is something soooo simple sooooo good? I mean its chicken and rice. Or am I missing something? The chicken tastes like its been marinated for weeks and the brown rice absorbs enough of the sauce to make the chi-town chicken bowl exceptionally tasty. Other than it being a little on the spicy side once the sauce is added (even if you ask for the milder version) the food is fantastic. I've tried it a few times now trying to see if it was a fluke but nope chicken and rice is great everytime.
