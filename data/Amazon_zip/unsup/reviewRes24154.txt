My wife and I ordered takeout from here while visiting Chicago based on the recommendation of a friend. We were usure about what to get so the gentleman taking our order suggested the salt and pepper ribs, and all I can say is that they are outstanding. I am home in St Louis now, and right now I am craving those little ribs.
