This place earns another star from me...after a Jersey Boys show we were looking for a nearby place for drinks/appetizers, and having our Mom in town we decided to treat her to the Signature Room - it was overly crowded, horrible service and it smelled like a cruise ship....so my sister and I Yelped from our iPhones and discovered Grand Luxe is open late and was just a few blocks away! Plus, at 12am you don't get the hour wait and touristy crowd. Our waiter was wonderful and we had such a great time singing "Sherry" as we enjoyed our spinach and artichoke dip (with fresh salsa!) and a thin crispy pizza! The huge menu really comes in handy late night!
