Sexy. Intriguing. Mysterious. I didn't know what to expect but I liked it. The ambiance was dark and almost made you feel like you were hiding from someone or what you were doing something illegal. Some of the drinks definitely were stiff (such as the rootbeer drink) and helped you feel like you were back in the prohibition years. We stumbled upon this place so I had no expectations. I am almost scared to go back because I'm not sure I'll like it as much. Sometimes hype ruins it for people and I could see that here. However, I would still recommend checking it out if you are in the area. It's a refreshing change of pace from many of the surrounding bars.
