i love bongo room. so. damn. much. even though we live close by, we don't get there as often as we would like. there's always a wait but it is absolutely worth it if you have the time. i would say bongo room is much better for the sweet style brunch. and less desirable if you tend to like savory brunch. they have a lot of options either way, but in my experience, they're more experts on the sweet side. i always opt for one of their gourmet pancakes. some of these change seasonally and i always try whatever seems new. they never disappoint. i've also had a bunch of the benedicts they offer. these are great too, although, if you're going to bongo room, go for the indulgence - get the pancakes or french toast etc. yum. just yum.
