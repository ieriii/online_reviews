I don't mind waiting when given a correct wait time. But quoted 20 minutes and then turns out to be almost an hour?. we started with the the shaved hearts of palm. what a disappointment. it tasted like canned hearts of palm that were unrolled. had no flavor whats so ever. next by suggestion of our server an egg toast with a truffle oil. blah it didn't work. next a pizza with broccoli rabe sausage and motz. it was ok not done enough soggy, and sausage was flavorless. next 2 different pastas first crab meat in pasta with an uni sauce. it was marginal and a black pepper and Parmesan which was pretty good. Portions could been a bit bigger though. We were really disappointed. Phil Vettel just gave it 2 stars? maybe we didn't order the right things?
