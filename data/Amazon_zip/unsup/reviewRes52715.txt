You need to like red meat to appreciate this restaurant. We were a party of 5 and had reservations around 5:30 on Sat. 3/26, celebrating 2 birthdays. We were seated immediately. The salad bar was ample but seemed to be missing croutons (for the caesar salad) and soy sauce for the tuna. I'm told by one of my fellow diners that the mushroom risotto was excellent. The service was extremely attentive and friendly with a sense of humor. The meats, poultry and sausage were great. There were people in our party that like all different kinds of beef, chicken and pork. We all noticed a difference in flavors. We also liked the pineapple. We missed the fried polenta that they serve at Fogo. Some of us ordered dessert...good desserts...not over the moon, I'm in heaven great....but a very solid "good". All in all we had a great time. We were never made to feel rushed so they could turn the table. We will go back.
