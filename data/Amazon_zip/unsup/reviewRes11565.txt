I dig this place, but SOME of the waitresses/hostesses are such alternative-nation Stepford Wives that they barely know what you are saying when you ask for a table. If you can get past the raft of quaalude-filled chicks at the door, you're in for some great food. Oh, and make sure you get some cheese in your omelette or it will be dry as hell, but perhaps that goes without saying.
