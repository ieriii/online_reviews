For some reason I didn't like this place the first time I came here (thought it was overrated given the wait and all), but one day I just randomly started craving the roasted bone marrow and the nutella dessert. And now I come back as often as I can! My favorites: Roasted bone marrow: super flavorful bone marrow spread on toasty bread with cilantro salad and a sprinkle of sea salt--best way to start the dinner. Panino con nutella: s'more sandwich with marshmallows, bananas, and Nutella instead of regular chocolate. Can't go wrong with Nutella! Get there before 5:00PM and you'll only have to wait 15-20 minutes. After 5, the wait is 1-2 hours.
