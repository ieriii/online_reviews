My husband and I came here on an unexpectedly warm day in October and were seated immediately outside even though the place was packed. Our waitress was great, constantly checking in, but not in an annoying way. We started with the cheese curds, which were amazing! Not greasy at all and a nice crisp to them. I then had the chicken wings which were great and my husband tried 2 sliders, including the crab cake which he loved. We will definitely be back!
