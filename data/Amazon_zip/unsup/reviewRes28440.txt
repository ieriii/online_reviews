5 BEARS (my family), 3 appetizers, 1 soup, 3 Specials, 4 light entrees, 3 desserts, 3 drinks. Total cost: $220 inc t/t. Talk about new taste sensations in the mouth. It's hard to describe what to order since you really have to just go with your gut feeling and eyes. Peruse the menu carefully while waiting (you'll have a lot of time believe me) and decide what to get. Anything with duck is a good choice. Another good idea for firsts is the famous trio, trio, trio, three delicious ceviches complemented with house tortilla chips. The soup from the Topolobampo menu is divine. You will want that as well. It's essentially a tortilla soup drippin' in goodness and depth. You also might want to choose the "light entrees" which are cheaper over the "specials" to get a greater variety. But recognize the trade-off between more fanciful, high end food, and dressed up street food. The price varies accordingly. I also highly suggest ordering both a dessert and a drink (or two)! They're famous here for a reason. Note: On the line...yeah it's long. We got there at 145pm and got seated by 230pm. Wasn't so bad in my opinion since I expected to wait 1.5 hours!
