Was very disappointed with this place. We're looking for a private luncheon spot so we wanted to sample the menu. We came in for a late lunch on Sunday afternoon. We were one of 3 groups at the entire place, and the service was horribly slow. No customers; slow service? Wasn't a fan. We hoped the food would make up for it but we were not impressed. We ordered fried calamari to start and it was awful - the oil tasted like it had been reused and old. Bad flavor. I tried the fish special with sauteed veggies which was good, but nothing special. My friends got pizzas and the crust tasted off...definitely not freshly made. Overall just not impressed at all with this place. Wouldn't come back.
