I don't understand the appeal of this place. There's always a line, even early in the morning--people love this place. But I don't get it.  I've been here twice now, once for breakfast and once for lunch. When I see a line out the door at a restaurant I've never been too, I get excited, because they must be doing something right to get so many people to love them that much so they would be willing to wait in a long line for food.  My boyfriend and I came in for breakfast one weekend morning at about 9:30. The line was long but hadn't stretched outside yet, so we figured we were in good shape. It's cute inside, brightly lit, warm and inviting. We looked at what most other people seemed to be ordering and chose based on that. Maybe that was our mistake?  We decided to split the huevos rancheros and the smoked salmon bagel plate. We ordered, gathered our "supplies" from the counter, and sat down. Food arrived about 15 minutes later, except for the bagel. That came out about 5 minutes after the rest of the food. A minor annoyance, but I'd rather let the food speak for the restaurant. The smoked salmon plate was good, if rather expected. But the huevos rancheros, they were bland and boring--they tasted like someone's 75 year-old midwestern raised grandmother had devised the recipe. I want spice--hell, I'll settle for just taste in a batch of huevos rancheros--but these had none. I don't like to judge a place based on just one trip, because sometimes the problems on the first occasion can be solved just by ordering differently. So we came back for lunch, to give Milk and Honey a chance to redeem itself. We decided on the avocado sandwich and the BLT. The avocado sandwich was good, but the BLT was served with bacon so limp the bread got soft from the grease. I just don't get it.
