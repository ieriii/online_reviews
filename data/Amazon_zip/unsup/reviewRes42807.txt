So, apparently I'm the last of my friends to try this pizza. Despite trying to "eat healthy" lately, I said, "Ah, what the hell." And ordered a margarita pizza from them. Over-the-phone service guy was really nice and friendly. (Which is not the case with, say, Chicago's). The pizza was really good and satisfying. I think it's a little different because it has some sauce underneath the cheese even though it's "margarita," but they still had the basil and tomatoes on top. Yummy. In fact, since i didn't want to waste it, it was my lunch for the next three days. Definitely tastes better the night you get it, of course. I am looking forward to trying the other pizzas from here.
