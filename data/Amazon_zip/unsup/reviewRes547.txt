There is a reason this is the best restaurant in America. This was the best restaurant I've every eaten at and one of the best meals I've ever had. Dining here is a an experience you will never forget, Achatz deserves the hype, there is little I can say that will encompass the entire night, but the genius not only behind the food, but in it's conveyance is to be noted. For instance, eating a salad while hot rocks fill the air with the aroma of the basil placed on them gives you the sense of dining in the midst of a garden, or the cut of Kobe beef so succulent that your mouth explodes with the flavor. Each course is not only satisfying in taste but in presentation and consumption. I'm doing Alinea injustice by trying to write about the quality, just know you should go.
