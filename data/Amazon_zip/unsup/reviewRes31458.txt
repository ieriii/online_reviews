I have been here twice. Once for regular dinner, and once for happy hour at the bar. I've tried a bunch of things including various rolls, the duck baos, the watermelon unagi, oxtail pot stickers, and the duck hash salad. The only thing really worth mentioning here is the duck hash salad. It is SO DELICIOUS. Nice asian flavors marinated into the tender duck, a citrusy frisee, and daikon hash squares, with a very nicely fried egg on top. Make sure you have a little bit of everything in your bite, the flavors are wonderful.
