I hate giving 1-star reviews, but I was so flabbergasted by the shittiness of this experience that I couldn't even Yelp about it right away. I needed to complete a mourning process first. As I was eating my friend was like "Aw hell naw you gonna Yelp about this shit?" And I was like "...You know what? I don't even know." So I had to let the dust settle for about a week. Here I am, and let me tell you, the only two times I haven't tipped are here (they probably didn't even notice, or care, honestly) and at Hooters in Schaumburg when I got a girl with drawn-on angry Sharpie eyebrows and an attitude to match, but I digress. We came in, sat down, and waited some CRAZY amount of time (like half an hour, no joke) and couldn't even motion to anyone for service because it was such a crazy clusterfuck of "service" that I couldn't tell who was authorized as a server, who was a door-opener, who was a bucket-holder, w/e. So fast forward, my friend's a skeleton growing a beard, I'm looking at a Botox pamphlet and showing people pictures of my grandchildren, and a jolly little server comes up and GIGGLES (omg, GIGGLES, SERIOUSLY) and says "Sorry it takes so long. What you want?" We ordered, food gets there, it's pretty nice, it's in a big bowl and I got some mint twigs to play with and gnaw on like a minty koala. I took a few bites since this was on weekly binge day and I had already had Popeye's (better service and food), and took the rest home. While waiting for the check/getting mummified/slowly dying/being turned into a diamond, only us and another family remained. The staff starts picking up chairs, violently swinging them around and throwing them on top of the tables to clean up, sweeping dust and debris and garbage all over the aisles, screaming in Vietnamese (probably about that goofy, decaying, dead couple in the corner), etc. We somehow got reanimated and walked out, just barely managed to make last call at Flatiron.
