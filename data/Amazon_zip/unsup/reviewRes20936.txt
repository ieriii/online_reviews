I was first introduced to The Gage six months ago when a friend brought me there for lunch. I ordered soup and salad, which doesn't seem like anything special-- unless you're at The Gage. The soup was rich and flavorful. I was head over heels for the decor and the different seating areas in the restaurant. After my first experience at The Gage, I told my brother Peter about it, at which he told me he'd been there several times and cannot get enough of the Scotch egg. From the way he talked about the Scotch egg, you'd think it had cocaine sprinkled on it. This weekend I returned to The Gage for brunch and finally tried the Scotch egg as a shared appetizer. Peter was right: you have to order the Scotch egg! Everything else about my second visit to The Gage was spectacular. The service was great, the food was adventurous and pleasing, and the ambiance was perfect! I highly recommend The Gage if you're visiting the downtown area or if you're a Chicagoan meeting up with visitors who are staying downtown.
