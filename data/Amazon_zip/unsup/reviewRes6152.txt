Live in the area part-time...been here THREE times in the last two weeks. Go early, it gets busy and LOUD. Grub = We have tried a lot of the menu in these three visits. Enjoyed everything with the exception of the Pizza della Frattoria. Personal taste, I guess, and the egg was completely raw...yolk AND white.  Service = We have only had one mediocre server out of three visits.  Pet Peeve = You only get four small pieces of delish, oven-grilled bread (tuscan toast) with your crock of choice (vasi). Ask for extra bread upon ordering it. You will want anything you can to spread this goodness on. Favorites: ricotta & honey vasi, cacio e pepe (they are not kidding with the pepper, very spicey), pizza D.O.C.  Try it soon...it just made the Chicago Magazine top ten restaurants to watch in November. It is bound to get even busier!!!
