felt like i was at a stuffy, overpriced corner bakery... sandwich and soup menu with overpriced add on's - chips and salsa or guac and ok churros (churros aren't really my thing though). i felt like the counter guy taking our order was a former server applicant of frontera that just didn't make the cut. he was savvy...but knew it and it was annoying. i don't like goat cheese - i don't hate it - but will avoid it when possible. apparently at xoco, no substitutions can be made when ordering the all arugula sandwich with some mushy "roasted" mushrooms soaking in goat cheese. my options were limited (1 vegi sandwich, 1 vegi soup).  i don't normally "do" soup unless i'm cold or sick) so i had to play along and eat goat cheese.  the chips and guac were good but for $4, i wish we would've stopped at whole foods where we could get the same exact thing (frontera brand) for less. like others have mentioned - the bread is good - DAMN good. i scraped off the mushy shroom-cheese mixture, made a salad out of the arugula and had my side of bread :) after dissecting my meal, i realized that i had not gotten my glass of wine. we flagged down a server and he ran back to tell someone behind the counter. counter chick came over and asked us for a receipt! we were only given a credit card receipt so she said she'd have to check the register records. what the... by the time my wine came, i didn't even want it anymore... though it turned out to be the best part of my meal. note: as others have noted - i'm still airing out my sweater that reeks of greasiness. better ventilation needed. stat.
