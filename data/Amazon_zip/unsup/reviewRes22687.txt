When my Greek friends want to take me out to eat authentic Greek food, I go wherever they tell me. In this case, Greek Islands. It had been a long time since my last visit to this fine establishment, but it was just as wonderful as I remembered. The restaurant is buzzing with people, especially on a Friday night. It's a nice, laid back atmosphere, perfect for a date or a group outing. To start, we enjoyed a cold appetizer platter with tzitziki, octopus, and some other wonderful things (one had eggplant, the other roe) to smear all over our bread. Yummmm... I had to remind myself not to go too crazy because I still had my main entree coming. Continuing with tasty appetizers, we ordered the saganaki. How can you go out for Greek food and NOT order the flaming cheese??? For my main entree, I had the roasted leg of lamb with potatoes. So tender and delicious, the lamb melted in my mouth. The potatoes were a perfect compliment to the meat. Service was terrific. My water glass was always full and the waiter made sure that we everything we needed. On top of all the great things about Greek Islands, the added bonus is the free valet. What more can a girl ask for??? With or without my Greek friends --- I'll definitely be back for more!
