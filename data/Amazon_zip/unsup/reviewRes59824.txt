By far the best deep dish, stuffed pizza in the city!! I have not even ordered anything else because their pizza is so delicious! They do offer great day to day specials and awesome prices. The sauce on their pizza is unlike any other, they don't over do it with the grease and cheese like Gino's or Giodanios. They use just enough cheese and a good amount of crust. I love their pizza so much I always order more than I can eat in order to have left overs! I suggest making sure to have left overs and pop a slice in the toaster oven for lunch the next day!
