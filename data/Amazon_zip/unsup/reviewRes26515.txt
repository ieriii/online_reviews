The restaurant was packed throughout the day on Sunday. We took all the people heading in after church and the older people coming out as a very good sign. While it was very busy, I was impressed at how the staff was able to get everyone seated pretty quickly attentive and once attentive without rushing anyone once we were seated. I was surprised to receive a complimentary appetizer that seemed to be similar to chicharrones (with a tortilla) and was delicious. I couldn't resist the combination plate, which I was thankful actually seemed to have somewhat small versions of the taco, enchilada, tamale, and tostada. The horchata was overly sweet to me and I would recommend the barbacoa over the carne asada. The prices are all very reasonable (byob!). I would come back.
