Deciding how you feel about the Bongo Room involves hours of thought and sudoku-like concentration. This is a place that, on the right day, and when you're in the right mood, can be a total blast. They serve up some fairly creative, and cavity-inducing. styles of pancakes, and the rest of their menu features a seasonally changing list of unique meals. The problem is that the restaurant suffers from Chicago Cub-itis. They got so popular and have generated such a steady revenue stream that they aren't forced to spend money and put a winning team on the field. Such is Bongo Room. With the position in the book of trendy, the power of word of mouth and the good food came long lines and longer waits. It's not common now to wait two hours for a table, and then find yourself looking at a menu that you swore was more interesting the last time you were there.
