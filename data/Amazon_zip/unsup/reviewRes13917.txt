Love me a nice laid-back gastropub. After hearing about it from my bf's brother several times, we finally made it out to Logan Square for a late lunch. We waited about 5 minutes and were seated. The staff is attentive and our server was nice but nobody filled my water glass once. :( No bigs. First things first, you see all kinds of people here. Quite the eclectic group from hipsters to middle-aged couples to young families. Next - totally appreciate the affordable prices! I feel like they could get away with higher food/drink prices but they don't - impressive. I hear that some ex-sous chefs with really unique ideas became the chefs here, which is cool because they have some pretty unique twists on their dishes. We started with - of course - the bacon fat popcorn. I had no idea what to expect but this stuff was tasty. We also had the potato cakes. I'm not *huge* on curry so they weren't my fave but our vegetarian friend loves them. I had the Hombre burger: smoked poblano pepper, avocado, Chihuahua cheese, red pepper crema & tortilla strips - yum. It was huge and I could only eat half - plus all the fries. My bf had some of the best beef stew I've ever tasted - super gourmet: slow braised in mild ale and balsamic vinegar with garlic cream cheese mashed potato, french bean and carrots. Perfect. His brother had the smoked buffalo chicken pizza which gave us an idea of both their pizzas and their wings. Holy buffalo tomato sauce! It was tasty though. I was happy to taste a few of their items and can't wait to go back to try more. It seems as though you can keep going back and have a completely different dining experience as far as their different foods. I've heard the blue cheese potato salad is delish so I'll have to keep that in mind. As far as beer, I'm a wheat/Belgian fan and thought the Cross of Gold and the Bottom Up Belgian were good. I wasn't blown away though. My bf loved the Thee Destroyer a lot and isn't even a double IPA fan.
