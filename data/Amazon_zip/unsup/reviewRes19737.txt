Went here a while back w/a couple friends.  Recap: We wait a while for a table. Got seated and brought a couple of bottles of wine w/us. We ordered and asked to get a bottle open. They ran out of wine glasses so we got regular glasses. We poured some wine and then after a bit, out regular glasses of wine were filled with WATER. So all that went to waste and we got new wine glasses and opened the other bottle. Later our waiter spilled another another glasses on the table after knocking it over. Thru out the nite, I had to constantly look for him because he was no where to be found. To order more, I had to go get him at another table. Let's just say the service was HORRIBLE at best.  Then when we paid out bill, the hostess and waiter thought it would be appropriate to ask why he was not tipped more. (note: TIP = To Insure Promptness.) She said that it's typical to tip at least 20+% for their service.  Have ordered carryout a few times since. Got 3 stars because of the food. It seems that everyone agrees service is poor but food is good.
