First time visitor a few days ago. I heard all about it in papers, books, and friends. I finally got the time to head over there. I didn't know what to expect at first, maybe just the usually hot dog restaurants that I've been to. I ordered the Superdawg which came with a Chicago style hot dog and fries. The food presentation was unique. Food came in a small box which was ideal for eating on the run. The fries buried my hot dog when first opening my meal. I wasn't sure if I even received my hot dog. Eating a few unraveled the delight. Made to order from the first bite. They were quick and efficient. Will definitely head over there to try more of their entries. I look forward to my next visit because I heard a lot about the milkshakes and dessert!
