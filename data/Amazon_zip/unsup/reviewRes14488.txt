You gotta be kidding? How could something this good be so far away? And why in the h can't it be replicated in Indy? Where are all the Indy Cuban entrepreneurs? I don't even remember what I ate cause I had retrograde amnesia from the orgasmic wave that hit be after the first bite. Worth a three and a half hour road trip or a permanent move to Chi town. BTW only came here after reading Yelp reviews on nearby joints while freezing our ganorts off waiting in a ridiculously long line at Hot Doug's... glad we bailed!
