So I actually needed to go here twice before I wrote my review because the first time I went to Revolution I didn't order a burger, but my hubs did. And, of course, I stole a few bites and thought "Oh my God... I think this may just be the best burger I've ever had!" Needless to say, this is a very weighty claim and I needed to verify. So last night we went again, this time with my Mother in tow as well. And I ordered a burger (as did everyone else) and low and behold it is confirmed. Best burger in Chicago, in my humble estimation. The ground beef is fantastic that they use, its perfectly formed and seasoned and doesn't fall apart as your eating it. The toppings are also wonderful and don't overpower the burger, and the bun is really good and can hold up to the weight of the meat and toppings on top of it. It's the whole package: great meat + great toppings + great bun = the perfect burger. Oh, and the other stuff is great too, beer cheese soup, chicken wings, pizza, all good. The beer is fantastic, one of the better microbreweries in the greater Chicago-land area. It does get PACKED though, so plan to wait. And its LOUD, very very loud, no intimate conversations or romantic dinners here, but its a microbrewery so I wouldn't really expect that. They could put up some fabric panels or something though, to deaden some of the sound, but really nothing is going to stop me from coming back, so five stars!
