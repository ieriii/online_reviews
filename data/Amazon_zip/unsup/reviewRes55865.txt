Hands down the BEST Indian food in Chicago. The flavors are excellent and the heat level is perfect for a variety of tastes. They start you off with this tangy, creamy, tomato-based sauce for dipping with pieces of soft, fresh naan. So delicious it is making my mouth water just thinking about it. I love the samosa's and all the chaupati corner (Bombay street fare) items. Not many places can get the tamarind chutney just right with the perfect blend of sweet and tangy with nice consistency. This is the best I have found. The menu items are delicious, and you can't go wrong with the buffet either. The buffet food is kept fresh and warm unlike other places with dried out, overheated, old food. The mango lassi is again the best I have ever had. Sometimes, I like to get it as my dessert!
