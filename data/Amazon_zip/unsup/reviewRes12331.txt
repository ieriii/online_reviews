Dear Cafe 28, Do you remember me? When I first moved to Chicago, I used to come to you several times every week. Despite my little paycheck, I would come here for a few things: 1) Mojitos made by the adorable bartender (best in the city I've had so far) 2) Dirty Martinis made by the adorable bartender 3) Scotch on the rocks, 3 cubes of ice made by the adorable bartender and helping him out with his cig breaks Heehee. ;) Seriously tho...I really do miss you and your food: 1) Coconut shrimp -- omg, even after eating all the shrimp, the rice it sat on was phenomenal. 2) Plantains...you got me hooked on those things 3) Crabcake Benedict -- my weekend wouldn't be the same without this for brunch at least once every Saturday or Sunday 4) Honey Jalapeno Porkchops...delicious...delicious...haven't found anything around me that remotely compares 5) Tres Leches cake...a masterpiece...but I don't know if Mama Maria who used to make this is still there..... 6) Last but not least....best ceviche I've had in the city...seriously. Unique, flavorful, and sooooooo good.....I haven't found anything else like it I miss you, Cafe 28. I do....thought you were delightful....now, you are a little too far for me to go....maybe one day if the Blue and Brown Line ever connect...or if I find a friend with a car that's willing to take me. Much luv, The Asian Girl PS. Is that adorable bartender still there?
