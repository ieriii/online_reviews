I am sad to give this place only three stars because I was so looking forward to coming here and had high expectations. I think the main issue that brings down my rating was the seating that we got. We were practically sharing a table with another couple next to us and my chair was broken. We passed like 5 empty booths and then got seated in a cramp spot in the corner. I was quite disappointed and it definitely took away from the romantic ambiance. The food as delicious though, as well as the wine. If I go back again I would enjoy just having the cheese platter and some wine. And hopefully get a seat in the room with the live music and farther away than arms length from other eaters!
