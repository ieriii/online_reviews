lechon sandwich was delicioso. pork was tender and the sweet plantain gave it a nice touch. the veggie platter was also very fresh and well seasoned. the highlight would have to be the mamey tropical smoothie. it has hints of vanilla in it and it was just exquisite. end the meal with a cordadito or espresso shot and you'll walk out feeling like a million bucks. all this, for just $30.
