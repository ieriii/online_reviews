There are hundreds of restaurants in Chicago, but on my last trip I went to Le Colonial three nights in a row! The menu was a mesmerizing and I could not resist trying as many things as I possibly could. My favorite was the Bo Luc Lac(French cube steak with watercress and shaved red onion), which is by far my all-time favorite Vietnamense dish.
