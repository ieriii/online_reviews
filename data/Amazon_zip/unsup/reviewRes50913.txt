Soooo good...I came here for a breakfast/lunch after another place was closed, and I am so glad that ended up being the case. I don't remember the appetizer or breakfast I had but I do remember liking it, and being crazy stuffed. But what I really remember are the beignettes. OMG. This was a surprise that came with the coffee or tea (not sure which) that we did not order but was a "free" side. These pseudo doughnuts with powder were MMMazing. I spent that night comparing prices for deep friers b/c I wanted to make them so much (I also searched for places I could get them in Chicago but didn't come up with much). The rose tea was great as well, but the beignettes.
