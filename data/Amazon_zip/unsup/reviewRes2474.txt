What a awesome place. It was worth the 30 plus minutes in the freezing weather outside. We came directly from O'hare on a Friday afternoon. We were so glad we made it before the 4PM closing time. Since it was Friday, we were able to ordered the Duck Fat Fries, unbelievable delicious. The sausages were excellent, and the price was great. The two drawbacks to this place is the wait and the smokiness of the dining room (from the fryers and grill). But the food, price and friendliness of Doug deserves a 5. Don't miss the Duck Fat Fries!!!!!
