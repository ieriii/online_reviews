Coming here I had high hopes that this place was going to have amazing sushi after reading all the reviews. However, I was very disapointed. The rolls were tiny and the prices were too high for the quality of the fish. The rolls didn't taste special and our waiter was arrogant. I guess you have to try everything once and now I know that this place is just overhyped.
