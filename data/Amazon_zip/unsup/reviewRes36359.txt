Oh man, I could go on forever with this place. Everything we've eaten here has been great. This includes various types of omelets, the cheeseburger, cloud 9 crepes, stuffed french toast covered with strawberries. All the ingredients are the best quality. Fruits are delicious...the marmalades are homemade (My wife bought me some for home cause I love em so.)...the eggs are cage free (I believe...some type of healthy ones)...the whole grain toast is a great healthy option. My wife believes the cheeseburger is the best in Chicago...I agree. We usually pick our own dish and share a dish of the cloud 9 crepes. These are chocolate crepes with strawberry filling and real strawberries inside and on top. Oh yea, I'm not a coffee guy, but my dad said it was good quality stuff. Only negatives are that you will have to wait...be prepared for at least a 30 minute wait....and parking is difficult.
