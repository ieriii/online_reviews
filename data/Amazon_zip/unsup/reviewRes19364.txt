Came here for brunch after the Shamrock Shuffle with my friends. Although in sweaty clothes, I didn't feel out of place at brunch - but later in the day I would probably want to change clothes. Excellent strong coffee! Great unique beer menu. Corned Beef Hash = yum. You must get the scotched egg - it was so delicious, especially with the coarse ground mustard! Roasted potatoes were the highlight of my meal. Everything had wonderful flavor and I was happy to taste that they aren't afraid of spices and seasonings. Waitress was a little absent minded but it was busy so I can see that she was a bit forgetful. I'll definitely be back for brunch and try out their dinner!
