An all time favorite and best place for pizza in the city. My topping choices: pepperoni and goat cheese or sausage, basil and feta, both with red sauce. Pepperoni one is also amazing with a little ranch for dipping, but you'll have to bring your own. Note: the more toppings you get the more expensive the pizza. I suggest going in a four top and splitting the bill. On average, $30 per person with cocktails. Appetizers while you wait for your pizza: The greens salad (I literally crave this) or their guacamole (very authentic, must try). Drinks: Cider lovers, they have an extra large can with only 200 calories! Best time to go in: I suggest dining in during the week, although there is usually a wait. We usually put our name in and head across the street for a cocktail. Be sure to check back about 30 to 40 minutes later, their wait time is usually spot on. I've gone on Saturday afternoons too and you can usually sit pretty quickly then. I generally avoid weekends because the karaoke is so loud and the tables are so large you can't hear your friends. We love when we score a booth up top in the back, but only best for a four top. If you take it to go, don't be discouraged by the phone staff who will put you on hold a million times, presumably because there is a customer at the pickup counter. I don't get why they'd risk loosing a phone customer who can just hang up, just to take care of someone in-store, who's already there and not leaving! Knock out the phone orders or make that one person's sole job on the weekends, duh! It's about time management reevaluate the customer service going down on the pickup side. Trust me, business is being lost. If it weren't for the amazing pizza, I would have hung up too. Yelpers, don't be discouraged, it's so worth the wait.
