Pros: fast service, fun decor, impressive location Cons: I was not impressed by the food, especially considering the price. I generally got the sense of a McHaute-Cusine restaurant. Wine flights are overpriced and not so good - avoid. Overall: perhaps better for lunch. If you're going to spend this much, head over to MK instead - you'll be better wined, better dined, and no poorer for it.
