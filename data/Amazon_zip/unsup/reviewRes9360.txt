Don't let the name fool you, Le Colonial doesn't seem to show a lot of French influence in their cuisine. But don't let that deter you. The restaurant itself is very romantic with a soft, patio feel to it. And the service is excellent with servers constantly removing plates and refilling glasses. We had a tuna tartare appetizer - quite delicious. I then had a Chilean Sea Bass dish. The fish was excellent, very tender and soft; but I felt the sauce was a bit overpowering. Dessert was...meh. And the Vietnamese Coffee was a bit of a letdown. The reason I cannot give this restaurant anything higher than three stars is because I know I won't be coming back. Why? Because there are so many more excellent restaurants in Chicago. I just don't see myself as a regular here, and I don't think I'll be taking guests to sample the cuisine. Yes, the food is delicious, but considering the price, there are many other comparable establishments that provide better cuisine. It's worth a taste, but not much to return to.
