We were rained in on a Friday night and I cannot think of better place to be stranded. The interior is nondescript, but I don't think they are going for style points. The focus is definitely on the food and the booze. The whiskey selection is superb, they carry everything from white whiskey to bourbon. Their house old fashioned seemed a little heavy on the orange bitters, but it was tasty nonetheless. Even the wine selection had me happy with a great Tempranillo by the half bottle. The menu looked intimidating at first, and was definitely not what I was expecting. Dining with a pescatarian, her options were a bit limited. But the few choices she did have were fantastic. The ricotta cheese balls were amazing and the deep fried soft shell crab was perfectly crispy, but not at all greasy. Possibly the best I've had, even better than fresh fried crab in Louisiana! The meat eaters decided to get a little adventurous, for our palettes at least. The duck testicles were surprisingly good, and tasted like bacon - they must saute them in bacon fat. The sweetbread was identified by the MD at the table as a thymus. It was prepared to what I assume to be perfection, because it tasted damn good!  Unfortunately, by the time our dinners arrived, I was absolutely famished and drunk, so the reviews on the entrees could be a bit biased. My lamb shoulder was delicious. The meat was incredibly tender and the mint and cucumber were great match to the heavy flavors. The beef was good, but not my favorite. It was a bit chewier than I would have liked. But the person who ordered it was a big fan, and also a huge red meat eater.  I will definitely be returning to Longman as they challenged my palette and won me over with flying colors.
