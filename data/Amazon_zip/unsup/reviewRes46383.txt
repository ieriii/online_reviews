Sold! I am officially a fan, i have been to the Cheese cake Factory many times with varying experiences, but i have to say the Grand Lux Cafe kicks major Cheese Cake Factory Butt! We luckily got seated facing the wall of windows facing michigan avenue, my friends ordered the calamari salad and this indochinese chicken and shrimp dish, both were delish! Am already planning my next trip. (went on a Tuesday night, no wait and no tourist!)
