I was pretty excited about getting pizza from here and we ordered the thin crust, which was probably the mistake given everyone mentioned the pan-style but I don't really care for a lot of crust in my pizza. Unfortunately, the trust was soggy and and toppings didn't blow me away. Delivery was quick. The pizza was still warm but the garlic bread was cold and I had to re-heat it. I've simply had better pizza.
