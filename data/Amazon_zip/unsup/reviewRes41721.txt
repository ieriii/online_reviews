Holy crap this place is GOOD. Ate here for my birthday with boyfriend and sister. We ordered 2 new york strips (rare and PERFECT), the mashed potatoes, potatoes au gratin and green beans. My sister ordered the 3 course fall/winter meal with the filet w/ shrimp and an amazing salad (mixed greens, roasted corn, fried garlic, dried cherries, salted pecans, crumbled bacon and gorgonzola cheese I think) that I believe is seasonal as it's not on their main menu. Everything was SO good! I prefer their steak over Wildfire. Their steaks are aged and seasoned very well too, so they're incredibly flavorful even in the center. Do yourself a favor and order it rare. The hot plate will cook it a bit more as you eat it, but it tastes incredible when it's tender and rare. The butter is whipped and salted and so so good, on the steaks, on the bread, in the mashed taters, pretty much in everything. The restaurant is super dark though, but that's also a restaurant ploy to make you eat more. Valet and coat service are great (valet is $15 i think) and the servers are fantastic. For dessert we got a chocolate molten cake on the house since it was my birthday, and even though we were so full it was a little painful, the cake w/ ice cream and a super ripe strawberry (even in Dec) was incredible. This place pays incredible attention to detail; my boyfriend commented that even the silverware was so clean and shiny. They general manager also wrote me a card. Attention to detail can really put a restaurant a cut above others, and Ruth's Chris's attention to detail definitely does that for them. Next time there's a big event for a small group of people, we're definitely coming here!
