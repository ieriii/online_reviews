I LOVE Korean food. Nothing will beat it from the motherland, but sometimes when you just have to have some Dol Sot Bi Bim Bap you have to have it. This place is open 24/7 and it's good. Prices are fine, the staff is fine (there are definitely better and worse servers) and you leave smelling like Korean BBQ. One thing I DESPISE about this place is their uneven allocation of side dishes. Although they allege you get more when you get Gal Bi or Bul Go Gi, it's kind of hit or miss. Sometimes they just give you what they want. At times it may be a lot, at times you know you DEFINITELY did not get as many as the table next to you, though you ordered relatively the same things. I would've given them more stars had I not witnessed this on multiple occasions. What to try: Dol Sot Bi Bim Bap Dduk Man Doo Soup What to eat but know that it's better somewhere else: Jap Chae (it's too oily here but good) Single order of Bul Go Ki (When you cook it yourself it tastes better)
