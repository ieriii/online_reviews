After years of drooling over everything Rick Bayless made on TV, my husband and I finally got a reservation. Good thing too--they were running a 45 minute wait at 1:15 on a Saturday. The decor is colorful, gorgeous, and authentic. The tables are kind of on top of each other but whatever, let's get serious, we were all there for the food. And it DID NOT disappoint. Our order: *we were on a mission to eat our hearts out Micheladas--like a citrusy Bloody Mary made with Pacifico. Very different, very refreshing. Albacore ceviche--tasted great but it wasn't all that visually enticing. Tortilla soup--this will go down in history as my favorite soup of all time. It was absolutely show-stoppingly unbelievable. Bistec enchiladas--the hubby clean plate clubbed it with a few "yums" here and there for good measure Verduras milanese--so amazingly, deliciously unique. A welcome departure from standard Mexican fare. Came with a splash of habanero salsa and a warranted warning. I think I've finally met my match in terms of heat! Chocolate pecan pie with Kahlua whip cream--YUM Chocolate cappucino--picture perfect and tasted great to boot. Frontera lives up to the hype. GO.
