This a fun place to go, though you go there much more for the fun and atmosphere (and wine) than for the food. Menu consists of different combinations of beef, chicken and shellfish. Dinner is cheese fondue, entree (meat or fish) fondue with plenty of veggies, and then chocolate fondue. It's lots of fun. I get a kick just thinking about it .. big pot of boiling oil, crowd of friends poking forks at each other, the occasional floater ... ahhh. The scene is nice too. Very dark, heavy wood everywhere. Warm and inviting on cold Chicago nights. And oh yeah ... the wine list is phenomenal!
