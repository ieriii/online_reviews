OH MY GOD. I had dinner here for the first time last weekend. WOW. I went with a chef friend so naturally we got a bunch of stuff to try: the duck charcuterie plate and pork belly for starters, then the rabbit stew and brisket for our entrees. I have never had duck liver mousse before and was hesitant at first, but it was DELICIOUS. Everything we had was so well prepared and presented and tasted amazing. It's been a while since I had a meal of that calibur.
