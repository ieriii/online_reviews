I LOVE hotdogs and when I went to Chicago, I HAD to try this place. I think I saw them featured on FoodNetwork or Travel Channel as one of the best hotdog places in Chicago. So we went a little before noon & there was already a long line, parking was difficult, we parked like 2 blocks away on the street. I think I ordered a regular Chicago dog, drink, and fries that were cooked in duck fat (YUM!). It was good. They have a good selection of hotdogs made with all types of different meats. The food was good but the place was so packed that we had to wait (10 mins)for someone to leave so we could get a table & eat our food. Definitely was worth the wait (about 30-45 mins) & every hotdog lover should try this place least once
