My husband is more of a fan than me. I still go there cuz he loves it. He loves the lunch menu and I thought it was great that you can order it ahead of time. I do like their pizza I just can only eat one slice.. I'm more of a thin crust pizza and I know they have it but usually we go there for the deep dish. The service is good and they have dr. pepper!!
