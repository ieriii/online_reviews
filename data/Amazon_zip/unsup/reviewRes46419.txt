My husband and I received a $100 gift certifiate to Grand Lux which excited me because I had always wanted to try the restaraunt (I pass it all the time when i am on my way to pick up the hubby). Anyhow, we were lucky and got seated right away. The place is huge, and by the time we got done around 7:30, it was packed. The decor is really awesome, and I am sure the view from the window seats are awesome. I will say though that it was really cold inside the bulding. They are owned by cheesecake factory, so if you like the cheesecake factory then you won't be dissapointed. We asked our server for some reccomendations which were helpful. For starters we had the lettuce wraps. They were good, but way too many of those dried noodle things. Not sure if I would order them again. For dinner, my husband had an awesome chicken dish. It was like orange chicken but better. I was really jealous that I didn't get it. I had the pasta with sundried tomatos and veggies and chicken and it was tasty. They do the desserts made to order (at least the baked ones). We opted for the apple tart which was amazing. I had it with a hot choclate and it was perfect. All in all it was a great time and I will be back. My biggest complaint is that the valet took forever to get my car (20 minutes).
