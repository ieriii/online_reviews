I'm a little embarrassed to admit I called Alinea to make a reservation the day after I booked my flight to Chicago. I couldn't resist the chance for the Alinea experience I have been hearing and reading about for years and I didn't want to risk second thoughts on the part of my dinner companions. Do: plan for a leisurely meal, dress up (there is a dress code), be able (and willing) to forget price for one evening, and build up a healthy appetite beforehand, follow your server's directions (to avoid food disasters - lets just say I had a tapioca accident) Don't: forget to mention food preferences or allergies, be afraid to try new things, expect a single "main" dish, choose dinner companions you can't spend three hours straight with (no flat screens or music), memorize the menu beforehand (ruins the surprise) We had the touring menu and chose to forgo the wine pairing (not all of us were big drinkers). Instead, we ordered champagne to begin and a bottle of red wine for the meal. I can't begin to describe every dish we ate (some were quite mysterious even now), but a few of my favorites were the roe, foie gras with kimchee, and yolk dishes.  No need to memorize or photograph every dish, you'll get to take home a copy of the menu. The service was attentive and smoothly delivered (without being snooty), the decor was modern and understated, and the experience of exploding, swinging, erupting, melting food is both surprising and delicious. I won't say this is/was the best meal of my life (mom's home cooking is hard to beat), but it is definitely the most memorable dining experience I've ever had and (in my opinion) worth the cost. Note: While waiting for our coats in the hallway, we caught a glimpse of Chef Achatz hard at work in the kitchen!
