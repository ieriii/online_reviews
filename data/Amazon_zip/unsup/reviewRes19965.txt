Our wait was about 30 mins and we shared the following: vegetable soup, chips w salsa & guacamole and churros with dipping chocolate. All were phenomenal!!! The soup was so rich and flavorful and was perfect for the freezing temps. I also don't like guac but this guac was off the chain! And don't get me started on the churros....If it was socially acceptable, I plow thru those multiple times on a daily basis. That chocolate dipping sauce was just divine!  Additional perks: seats at the window watching the world go by and the choice of still or sparking wawa.
