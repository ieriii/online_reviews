I went for a business lunch today at the restaurant. I give the place 5 stars for decor and ambiance, what I enjoyed was the several photos of topless women which I thought was very tasteful. In the interest of an orderly meeting we were offered a set menu. The presentation was beautiful but the taste was par not sensational. This restaurant loses a star because many people wanted to go boxes but they refused to give any which I thought was just ridiculous. I'm willing to give this place another chance and choose something off the menu at which point I may give them a higher rating.
