Great restaurant! I went here with a big group of people. We forgot to bring our own wine and when we asked for a liquor store the manager/owner? insisted that he would send someone out to get it for us. Later, we went through one bottle of wine and he sent someone again to get us another!! great service - food was delicious. I had the catfish bowl - so many lovely flavors.
