My favorite restaurant in Chicago. No place can come close in terms of sheer value. You will walk out of here stuffed beyond belief for less than a 20. I've tried the Pho from the surrounding restaurants (when I've mistakenly drive up here and tried to get my fix on a Wednesday when they are closed) and none of them compare. Watch what you get though, some pretty exotic ingredients if you order the wrong thing. I stay pretty conservative with the traditional Pho which is enough to feed food to feed a large family and their neighbors. The other highlight is their steak bahn mi sandwich, I usually order 3 more to go just to stock up on at home. Fresh ingredients, perfectly marinated beef all soaked up in a crispy baguette. I like that they have several variations of Bahn mi, but much like everything else on the menu I haven't tried any of it, because I don't want to risk being let down from the high expectations of what is my favorite meal ever.
