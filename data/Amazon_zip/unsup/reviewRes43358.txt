I've been checking out places in Wicker Park since I might decide to move there and my oh my do I really like Milk and Honey. I had the Chicken Lime and Orzo soup and I would die to have the recipe. I also split a sandwich with a friend. It was their in house Roast Beef and you know what? There are 1,000 ways to screw up Roast Beef but Milk and Honey did NOT screw this one up. It was the most delicious sandwich I have had in a long time. I saw this advertisement for a Special Five Course Dinner they're having on April 14th for 85 dollars a person and I am seriously considering going, it looks absolutely delicious.
