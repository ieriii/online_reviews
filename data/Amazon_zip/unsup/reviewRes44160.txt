My new neighbor and best friend.  Breakfast sandwiches on the weekends are becoming and obsession and all the standards are awesome. Dipped into the cakes and pie case for the first time this weekend with parents in town visiting and was not disappointed, cheese cake turtle and key lime graham, mmmm.... Great coffee, people, outdoor seating, dog treats, etc etc etc
