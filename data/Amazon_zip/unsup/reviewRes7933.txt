My first experience to a Brazilian steakhouse.  Our party had to wait about 15-20 minutes even though I made a reservation--a slight annoyance. We were sent to the bar which was very busy with just one bartender cranking out drinks to about 2 dozen waiting guests. The service was really good after that. The meat servers were quick and friendly and they actually asked if you prefer any specific variety. They tried to come back and make sure you'd get more of what you liked. My favorites were the lamb chops, filet mignon (medium rare), beef with garlic and, surprisingly the chicken (white meat, wrapped in bacon). The lamb (shank?) was not very good. The variety of sirloins were decent. Generally the meat quality was quite good and nicely seasoned (some on a bit salty side), and you can choose how done vs rare it is. No sauces required! The salad-cold cuts bar was merely a "distraction" in this kind of rather pricey all-u-can-stuff-your-face meatfest. Why waste room in your stomach!! The veggie, cheese, coldcuts quality was pretty good though. The side dishes we had were mashed pt--ok; fried Plantains--very good (or just bananas?); and polenta--blah. Of course, we had no room for dessert. Overall, very good food (and lots of it!), great service, pricey (but average for this kind of place I guess.) The setting is festive, seating comfortable, good for small or large groups. I saw a solo diner and also families with little kids. I would love to go back, but am scared of getting Gout! This is a great place but a once-in-a-blue moon kind of experience.
