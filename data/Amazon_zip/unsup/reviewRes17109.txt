This restaurant had some of the best Indian food around. The restaurant is tastefully decorated not over the top or garish like some Indian spots. The appetizer of naan with butter chicken sauce was fantastic. The chicken tikka was good but the chicken curry was exceptional. Exc - Food, atmosphere Good - Service Ave - None Poor - None
