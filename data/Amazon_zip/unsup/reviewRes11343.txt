This place is not that good. The pizza takes a long time to come and is not worth the wait. If you want pizza in Wicker Park go to Pizza Metro. Moreover, the layout is the opposite of cozy. I appreciate the fact that they have live band karaoke, but the atmosphere just ruins it. I would go to Stanley's on a Sunday night instead.
