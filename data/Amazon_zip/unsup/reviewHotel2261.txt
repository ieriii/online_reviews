The hotel is a great location on the Magnificent Mile and across the street from Nordstom's! Praise the lord the Marriott Downtown hotel had the availability since I was scheduled to have my event at the JW Marriott (ahem Legionnaire's disease - no thanks!). Anyway it all worked out the catering & hotel staff is top notch here. Everyone is super friendly and helpful. Plus they have an abundance of meeting space. The hotel rooms are small and needs updating. But who's complaining...this hotel is great for meetings.
