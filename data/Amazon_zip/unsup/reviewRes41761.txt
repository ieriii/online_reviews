Finally tried it. It was good... but not $250 for two people good. Great place but you are paying for the name. I have had steak just as delicious if not better for half the price. I was warned by a couple friends that "you're paying for the name". They hit the nail on the head. My girl and I tried the salmon patties, filets, shrimp (a little overdone and undersized), asparagus, potatoes (french-fried), and the chocolate cake dessert. All just average with the exception of the french fries fried potatoes - I love when they make them that thin! I'd recommend if you have money to burn - Try it once.
