Wow, what a place, it almost makes time stand still. My wife and I walk in and it's a 60's supperclub done with amazing food at great prices. My wife and I sat on sunday night and ordered a bottle of wine, then decided to order a few pastas. The pastas came with soup and salad. The fungi pasta is amazing and incredibly rich. We left the restaurant full, with still a chunk a change in my pocket. I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for 5 star food and service at a 3 star price.
