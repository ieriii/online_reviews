Milk and Honey is an all time favorite brunch spot of mine, and thankfully it is so close to my house! I have loved everything that I tired there, my favorite being the huevos rancheros that are only available on the weekends! I was here earlier today with one of my fellow yelping buddies she had the huevos rancheros and I had the Pancakes du jour. We both had fresh grapefruit juice to drink- and wished the glasses were a little bigger! I think the way the restaurant is run is awesome- you order your food, pay and then get seated. So by the time you get seated you wait for your food, eat and then go! You don't have to wait around for the check and getting change..etc.
