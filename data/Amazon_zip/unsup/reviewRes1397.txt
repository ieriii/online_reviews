So you ask yourself, "Is two hours an obsurd amount of time to wait for a hot dog?" The answer I gave the folks as I walked out, who asked me the same question, "Absolutely NOT!" The man friend and I took a cue from Lance Armstrong and embarked on a "Tour-de-Chicago", with half-time-hot-doug's in mind. After a slight error in directions on my part, we took our spots in the long line around 12:30...at approximately 1:30 I started second guessing and eyeing up the Popeye's down the road...at 1:45 everyone around us started with the tired and hungry fits of complaints...at 2:15 I was on the edge of the stoop trying to get a feel for if people enjoyed their dogs and rationalize the wait...at 2:30 we had three beautiful dogs, cherry cokes, duck fat fries, and huge grins on our faces!! The menu is overwhelming...people printed it out beforehand so they wouldn't hold up the line...we pulled it up on my phone countless times to come up with our plan of attack. I went with the pork with apple sausage topped with gouda and siracha mustard...three things I would've never put together, but tasted extremely gouda on the bun!! My man friend opted for a jalepeno dog with pepper jack cheese and an original hot dog with chili, cheese and carmelized onions...this one was ol' faithful and won for the best! Don't even get me started on the duck fat fries!!!! Whoa...party party in ya mouth!! We had nothing left on our table except for some chili-filled napkins when we were done.  Let's just say the rest of the bike ride had us moving at a slower pace....but Hot Doug's was well worth the wait!!!
