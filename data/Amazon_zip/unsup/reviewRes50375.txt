Wow less than half full on a Saturday and for good reason. We used to love this place but the service has declined and prices have gone through the roof. Food was good besides cold beignets coming out 1 minute before food and a half a rotten avocado on the corn cake dish. Ordered a sausage dish that never came. We are done with big jones unless we have a big party on sat or sun and are desperate for a table
