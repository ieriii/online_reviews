I have only ever had the pleasure of enjoying Sunday brunch here and it is so delightful that my friends and I have made it an almost weekly ritual to haul ass here after church and cross our fingers that they aren't out of anything! First thing we order: Publican mimosa is amazing - I never would have thought beer and orange juice would be so much better than a champagne mimosa! I even tried a "beer-mosa" at Cafe Centraal in Milwaukee for comparison and it came nowhere close to the Publican mimosa. The German beer that they pair with the orange juice is perfect. Second thing we ALWAYS order - fries w/fried eggs on top and the maple syrup braised Publican bacon. Those dishes alone make for a perfect meal but when there are at least four people fighting over every last morsel, you really should order an entree! I have tried the red-wine poached eggs, la quercia prosciutto (that is sliced fresh in house), sourdough & bearnaise - best kind of "benedict"! The fried french toast I had once but a bit over-fried and kinda hard, but the warm apple compote and housemade maple sausage that accompanied it made the dish really stand out. My sister once ordered the ham & eggs and when the plate came we felt like the Flintstones! The hunk of "ham steak' seriously reminded me of the "brontosaurus burgers" made popular in the opening credits of the show (that caused the car to tip over in the drive-thru). Last but not least - if you are lucky enough to get there before they run out, the cashew sticky buns are TO DIE FOR! I always take a few home to enjoy later once I get my stretchy pants on!
