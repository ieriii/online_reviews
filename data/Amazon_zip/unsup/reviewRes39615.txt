What is it with bars serving expensive food these days? I thought bars were supposed to be cheap. I really liked the food, atmosphere and service at L&E but I just don't appreciate the $9-10 apps and small plates with three bites of food. And I'm being generous here with the three bites. So why the four stars? Well, it's hard to hate on a place that does everything right except for the price. OK Christoph, we've established that you are cheapo, now get to the point. Alright, for starters the food and drinks I tried were phenomenal. I had the cheese plate and the scallops. And our server, I think his name was Mike, was funny and cool in a way I'll never be. Actually I think someone else brought out our plates, but they were very patient and friendly as well, taking the time to explain everything to L&E newbies like myself. Maybe this is unimportant, but I really loved the sparkling water in corked bottles. It made me want to get one of those soda maker kits from SkyMall so I can make my own carbonated drinks at home. Plain water is just so dull, am I right? So I don't know the first thing about whiskey, but I did enjoy the single barrel flight. Three perfectly poured 1.25oz samples made for interesting conversation, and surely added to the enjoyment of the evening. The crowd was slightly older than I expected and the tables are so close together it's basically communal seating. Not a bad thing, just giving you a heads up. I'll reserve any further judgement until after my second or third visits, as I can't comment on entrees or desserts just yet. Needless to say my mouth was watering just reading the menu so I expect great things. See you soon, Longman & Eagle.
