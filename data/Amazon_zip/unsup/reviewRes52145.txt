I almost gave Gino's East 4 stars based on the service but really the pizza makes up for it. One piece of advice.... PREPARE TO WAIT! You will find a long line when you get there. The nice thing? You can drink while waiting!!!  The place was incredibly busy and they were running low on what seemed to be everything, but the pizza was so great~!! I loved that there was so much sauce and cheese, my 2 favorite things on a pizza! Usually I can only eat 2 pieces, but I just stuffed more and more down it was so delicious!!! The portions are healthy and I can't get over the taste! Would definitely go back!!
