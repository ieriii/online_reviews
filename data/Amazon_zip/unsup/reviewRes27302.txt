I have to say GE is a concept that felt right for my wife and I. Yes the music is loud but I like loud music and I like when it is Jimmy Eat World and Kings of Leon.  Second thing, the popcorn here rocks. Sometimes when I can't eat anymore and I end up at a movie after dinner I *still* get popcorn. If you are one of those people, I think you will enjoy popcorn vs. bread. Third, it definitely is odd that: 1) there's a hair salon across the way; and 2) artichoke is used extensively as artwork / display. But I love the food, service and ambience. Also after living in NYC frankly I've seen much worse next to great restaurants. Food: Scallops are a must, they are served with bacon and topped with fried pickles.  Also my Halibut was one of the best dishes I've had in a while, smoked eggplant with cous cous which sounds standard but this wasn't anything but. If you are not too into smoked foods, I might caution you about this place, as both dishes were for people who enjoy smoked flavors. - Service was great, our waiter was very attentive, made great wine suggestions and did not rush us at all.
