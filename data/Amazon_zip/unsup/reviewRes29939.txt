It should be noted that I am not a vegetarian or a vegan and that I came here unaware that this was a vegan restaurant (yes, I am the only person in Chicago who didn't know this was a no meat zone). That being said, I was unimpressed by the food and thought it was quite drab. We got the "cheez" sticks and they were runny and unappetizing. My quesadilla was very plain (just cheese and tortilla) and my boyfriend's gyros were...interesting. The service was wonderful and very friendly, but I won't be back. To all you Chicago Diner lovers out there: more power to you. It just isn't my thing.
