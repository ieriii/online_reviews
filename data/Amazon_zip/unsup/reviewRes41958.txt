The place was totally packed, and service was certainly not attentive, but if you just want a steaming hot bowl of deliciousness, this is clearly a good place to go. My soup was absolutely perfect on this dreary, rainy day. The broth was flavorful and delicious, and there were tons of noodles for me to happily slurp. They also brought a huge plate of basil, mint, and bean sprouts for me to add. Again - it's seriously a no-atmosphere kind of place, but for a quick lunch on a cold day, it was PERFECT.
