I was utterly surprised by Wildfire. For whatever reason, I had this preconceived notion that it was some cheesy restaurant which was in way too close proximity to Hooters & Ed Debevic's (eww to both). But I was shocked at how good the food was. From the "Starters" portion of the menu, I had the spinach & artichoke fondue and the cheese crusted portobello mushrooms. Both were just amazing. I then had the Wildfire chopped salad. By looking at the menu, the ingredients look like they are all over the place (scallions with tortilla strips?), but I promise you, it tastes really good. Now for my favorite part of this meal. The night that I went, there was a special on a trio of steaks. I had one with black peppercorn, horseradish, and blue cheese. OMG. All three were amazing. But the blue cheese filet stole the show. Honestly, I didn't even have room for dessert. I took one bite of the triple layer cake (which was delicious) and that's all my stomach could take. I highly recommend going to Wildfire. Its not a place to "be seen" if that's what you're looking for. But the food is amazing.
