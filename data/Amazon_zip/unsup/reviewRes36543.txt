We LOVE breakfast and brunch, and this place does not disappoint. Egg dishes are very good, if you are a fan of omelettes and fritattas, Juices are fresh, coffee is good. Wait staff is very attentive and very nice. I have been here about 10 times. Parking is easy in Greek town in the morning. Kid friendly, too!
