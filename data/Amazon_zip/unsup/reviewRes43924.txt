The food here is decent, at best. To be honest, there are a few great items, but the vast majority of the food is fair (if my rating was on the food alone it would get a 3). The service is awful. The staff is unfriendly and always seem very busy, unwilling to proactively help. No one smiles either. ever. Here is the icing on the cake: my meal the other morning was $17 and change. I paid with a $20 and the girl at the counter put my change in the tip jar!? In no way did I give her any impression to do so. I wanted to take my coffee to go, and it took me 4 minutes to make eye contact with someone behind the counter to even look at me.
