Ok second time here and honestly again, the service was spotty at best. Our server, Natalia was quite possibly the most apathetic waitress I've encountered. My friend and I ordered various appetizers that never arrived only to be told later that they sold out. That followed with an entree that never came and then we ordered dessert - affogato (scoop of ice cream with espresso poured over it, pretty flippin' basic, right?) 15 minutes later Natalia waltzes back to tell us that they now have a broken ice cream maker. So she returns with another dessert to compensate on her. The gesture would have been very nice if either one of us actually were asked what we would like instead - we weren't. She never once checked in on us. NOT ONCE to ask if the food was good, did we need anything, go to hell, etc. Her attitude was like someone who did not want to be at work.  Her co-worker on the other hand, spent time with each of her tables, talking to them about their food, wines, etc. Basically giving good customer service. Natalia should take some pointers from the others or find a job she's actually interested in doing.  And just the like the last time I was there, the other servers were just bringing out small plates and plopping them down, looking for us to make room and accommodate them.  Sorry at The Purple Pig's prices, you need to train your staff and remind them that they are in the hospitality industry. They are not the ones expecting good service, they are the ones expected to give good service to paying patrons. The food is good but with shit service people will go elsewhere.
