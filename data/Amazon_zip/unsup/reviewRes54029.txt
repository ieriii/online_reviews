Our Journey starts on a plane from Seattle, and could have very well ended at Violet Hour and I would have been happy. Finding the place was just the beginning of what added to the mystique in my mind. Marked only by a light and a door handle, the door almost eluded us. After passing through the large velvet curtains I felt transported. The tall blue booths, lovely marble bar counter, and a back bar full of the herbacious liquids I so desire...Violet Hour was nothing short of my idea of heaven. We came in from Seattle to celebrate my birthday...and the drinks I got there were the perfect dessert. I was in on Oct. 29th, and Thursday night, and it wasn't very busy. The bartender was fantastic, and made me a delicious negroni type cocktail and a mouth watering Manhatten. When I come back to Chicago...I will be back at Violet Hour.  Cheers
