I will give this place a 3.5 I went here the Saturday before Valentines Day to celebrate. I will agree with what everyone says. The food and services is great. This place can be truly romantic and the live music is a nice touch. Nothing was pushy or over the top just classic romance. All of that was great. For all of this, it deserves 5 stars. I didn't give it 5 starts for 2 main reasons. I booked our reservations on the first day they take Valentines day reservations. When I did this, I requested a booth. We did not get a booth. Instead we got a horrible table next to where they store extra chairs and tables. And we couldn't even sit across from one another. (they cram wayyyyy too many tables into this small restaurant) Secondly, I understand that it is part of a fondue place, but you leave smelling of burnt oil. I know this is expected, but i didn't think it would be bad enough to have to get my coat dry cleaned. You have to go. It is part of Chicago. Just know that you will have no elbow room and should go wearing elastic pants.
