We met some folks here on a recent weekend evening and waited and waited and waited and waited for a table. All in all it was a 2 hour wait for a table (the hostess misjudged the waiting time by about 30 minutes). We had been warned that this was likely going to be the case and, luckily,we spent most of the time waiting at a nice wine bar across the street, Beviamo. Yet, the restaurant's no-reservation policy, combined with its popularity, leads to a 4 star rating instead of a 5 star rating and would be an impediment to a return visit from us on a weekend.  The restaurant is very small and includes a longish bar area at the front. It was very crowded (and we avoided the crowd by, as indicated above, taking refuge in Beviamo across the street).  The restaurant itself was crowded and it seemed that a number of the tables consisted of large groups of diners. The Italian-centric food is intended for sharing (think Italian-inspired tapas) and was excellent. Highly recommended are the grilled romaine salad (their take on a caesar salad), truffle egg toast and the pizza della terre (mushroom, leeks and truffle oil). Surprisingly good was the cheeseburger! Service is efficient and not rushed. The wine list appears to be mostly Italian (though we chose a Priorat, which we don't seem to find on many restaurant menus in Chicago). We were told that the wines sold by the glass are priced at retail with a $7 corkage fee (as of February 2011). The pricing was reasonable given the excellent quality of the food.
