My wife and I tried this restaurant after seeing the chef on TV. We were greeted by the staff and the manager Jeff who were all extremely nice and courteous. We had the halibut and the walleye which were both fantastic. The only bad part of our evening was that we had an incredibly obnoxious and drunk woman next to us that would not stop talking to us and rambling about everything and anything. The waitress noticed this and Jeff came over and very nicely offered to buy them a drink to have out on their outdoor patio. He apologized to us and gave us a discount on the bill, all of which was unnecessary but entirely appreciated.We will definitely be back again.
