Very good breakfast joint. I went here on a weekday and the service was eggcellent. Sorry, couldn't resist:) The food is good. My girlfriend got an egg white scrambler which was divine! I had a skillet, which was pretty good. It was overflowing with cheese and potatoes, which was a little too heavy for me. Sometimes less is more, Meli. My OJ was freshly squeezed and the jams are delish! The service was absolutely top notch. Our waitress was very attentive and polite. I will definitely be back!
