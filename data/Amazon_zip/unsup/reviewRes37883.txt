Maybe I'm not a fan of the Chicago deep dish style, but i felt that the pizza wasn't that great. There was too much cheese, not much of anything else (I ordered the special with pepper, mushrooms, onions, and sausage). Also, the tomato sauce wasn't seasoned well, and it was very plain. You have to wait 40+ minutes to get it as well, but that's just the physics of cooking something that thick.  Service wasn't that friendly and it was hard to figure out where to order, go, sit, etc.
