Roasted Duck Hash Salad. let me say that again. Roasted Duck Hash Salad. I love this thing. GLAZED DUCK, DAIKON CAKE, FRISEE, CRISPY EGG, UNAGI GLAZE. This was the first item I saw on the menu, and the only thing I really read. Duck-i love it. Daikon-one of my favorite things. Egg-eat it every day and enjoy it. Unagi-had initially planned on getting an eel roll anyways. So of course I ordered it and it was the best thing I've had all month. Shared a bit (just a bit) with a friend, and we even had to order a second one. Yes, it's that amazing. The service was also very nice. We came before the dinner rush and sat at the sushi bar. The very nice chefs in front of us gave us complimentary salad and rolls. Our waiter was constantly available as we kept ordering more and more plates. Our water was always full. The kitchen was zooming fast. Our plates all came before we give it a second thought. Overall a very enjoyable night. I was already planning my next trip back as I walked out the door.
