I so want to like this place. It's a nice cozy little place with a fantastic beer selection. What's not to like about that? But when this place is so packed, cozy turns to cramped, then trying to get to the bar was the next challenge, and trying to get a beer at the bar, good luck. You would think that getting your beer means that you would have won, but your final challenge is trying to transport your sweet nectar of fun back to your table without spilling it or someone bumping into it. Makes a Survivor episode look like a walk in the park. The beer will bring me back, but I'll be here early to avoid the crowds.
