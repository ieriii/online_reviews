I really wanted to like this place. It's very comfortable inside and has a very casual vibe. The food, however, was not that great. I had the empanadas appetizer. I chose the goat cheese., chorizo and rojo viejo options. They weren't flavored very well and were very salty. The goat cheese was pink and had pimentos in it, like it was made from a cheese spread, or something. We also ordered the tostones rellenos, which were the worst of the worst , stinky tiny shrimp, mixed with tomato sauce with no flavor, except a ton of salt. It's possible these would have tasted ok with some sort of sauce, but there was none served. My co-diner then ordered the lechon dinner which was tough-ish and tasted like onion soup mix. It was also really pricey (12.95?) which did not fit the super casual look of the restaurant. There was no pico di gallo or any sauce for that either. They also served the world's largest rice mound which took up most of the plate. The wait staff was really nice, though.
