Debating between 3 and 4 stars here. The drinks are excellent and probably will impress just about anyone. The deviled eggs are a no-no, but the peanut butter, banana, and bacon sandwich is surprisingly good. The $11 you spend on each drink includes tax btw, so I guess that's an added bonus. Now what I don't like: Speakeasy? Que? Come on, you're not that cool. Prohibition ended in what 1933? Why are they playing soft 50s and 60s music and marketing a sandwich as Elvis's favorite? Every third bartender or so had a striped shirt and suspenders on reminiscient of a poor vaudeville getup, but it wasn't across the board and they didn't match so it didn't quite work. If they really want to come off as a speakeasy themed bar, they have some adjustments to make. As far as the quiet relaxing factor - I suppose this is a nice change of pace from the typical Chicago bar, but I have to admit, I grew somewhat bored after the second drink and wanted some audio or visual stimulation. It was also sooo dark in the back room I could barely make out the people 5 feet away from us. Maybe you're not supposed to stay much longer than a drink or two? Oh yeah, almost forgot... re: the smoking policy, apparently that is not enforced in the unisex bathrooms as I'm quite sure the person before me had a little one man/woman party in there. You might even say a one hit party.
