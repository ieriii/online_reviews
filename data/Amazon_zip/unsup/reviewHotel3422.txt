Let's be honest, the Allerton only has one thing going for it. That one thing is its amazing location. It is right in the middle of Michigan Avenue, right in the middle of the stores, crowds, restaurants, etc. It's just a few blocks away from the red line so very easy to get to from either Chicago airport without a cab or renting a car. Unfortunately, that's where the good things end. The Allerton is a very old hotel and it shows. The elevators are teeny, teeny, tiny and are comically inadequate to service a hotel of this size. The bedroom furniture is quite old and there's NO DRAWERS in the rooms to put your stuff. There's no BATHROOM COUNTER or anywhere else to put your toothbrush, etc. There's just a free standings sink. Even that sucks because the edges of it are slanted so if you try to balance anything on it, it just slides into the sink! I can't complain too much because we got a good rate on Priceline. I do not at all agree that the Allerton deserves it's 3.5 star status that Priceline assigns it. The excellent location is the only reason I'll give 2 stars versus 1.
