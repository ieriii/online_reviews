I give The Purple Pig 5 stars on each of the 3 occasions I have been there, for a grand total of 15 stars in 2010. Sure you could order something that wouldn't normally satisfy your ordinary taste bud preferences, but the joy of The Purple Pig is that you discover a new taste that you didn't know existed, or that you didn't fathom you would like. I have gotten the Braised Pork Shoulder (which melts in your mouth) every time as an anchor in case the more adventurous options are a little too adventurous. Thankfully, I haven't had to rely on the Pork Shoulder to bear the load.
