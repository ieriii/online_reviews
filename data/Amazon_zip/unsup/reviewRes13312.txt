After reading all the reviews for Glenn's we figured we had to give it a try. Our first impression was really messed up by a hostess that made us sit at a table near the door (it was like 40 out and cold as hell) while there were open tables everywhere. We asked if we could take some of the other tables but were told they are all reserved. Our first instinct was to leave right then but we decided to stay and give the place a shot. We really were disappointed to see that all the "reserved" tables remained empty the entire time we were stuck next to the door freezing our azz off. Lots of great places in NorthCenter so we don't think we will give Glenn's a second try...
