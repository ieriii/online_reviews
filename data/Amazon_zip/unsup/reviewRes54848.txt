Despite the waiting, waiting, waiting which I'm obviously not great at - I can't even take a star off because I enjoyed the food so much. Veal cheeks with morel sauce, pork belly with avocado mousse, belgian beef stew, mussels and frites - all to die for. If you can't find a beer there you like, well then you probably just don't like beer very much. I wish it wasn't so far away from my entire life in the west loop, but it's well worth the drive and even the dreaded wait.
