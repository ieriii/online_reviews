So much has already been written about Hot Doug's, so I will keep this review brief. Simply said, Hot Doug's is one of the most charming (it's certainly the most hippest) hot dog restaurants in the city. And with a large menu of various dogs and sausages (even a vegetarian dog) complete with colorful ever changing names, you can be as adventurous you want to be. But don't worry, if all you want is a Chicago style hot dog, you won't be disappointed. My only complaint (other than the poor location) is that Hot Doug's is only open until 4pm. Also, you should be warned that if you make the trip out to Hot Doug's on the weekend (closed on Sundays) you will find yourself in a line that goes out the door and down the length of the building's side. Oh, it should also be noted that Doug (who takes your order) just might be the friendliest restaurant owner in Chicago.
