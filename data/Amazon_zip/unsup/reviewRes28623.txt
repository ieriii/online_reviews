I was the only local of my group who had been there more than once-no one would go back because the staff is so rude, but I over looked for the food; which I liked and no one else thought worth the price and snot factor. BUT NOW.....I too am a hater. I called well in advance for a Tuesday reservation stating it was my Mother's 80th and she wanted to try the restaurant. As of a week later I was unable to get a call back but finally reached a very curt girl Monday at 4 pm. She informed me that there were 80 calls to return as they had been closed for the week end. That's wonderful for you I said but half those calls were probably mine and I called well in advance of the week end.. Then the nasty derriere puts me on hold for 60 seconds (at least, I just hung up, enough is enough). There are so many thankful and fine restaurants in Chicago, why pay for abuse?!?!? Anyways, I know they will miss locals like myself in the cold winter when the rich and ignorant are dining in warmer climes!
