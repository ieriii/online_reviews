The reputation of Chicago Diner precedes itself, but I still feel the need to show some Yelp! love. This place is the mecca for vegetarians/vegans...BUT I have dined here enough times with omnivores to know that it can please even the pickiest of meat eaters. My go-to is the Radical Reuben with sweet potato fries and a Bell's Oberon (in season). Other favorites include the california reuben (close second), gyros, sweet potato quesadilla and the mac and cheese. The biscuits and country gravy are A MUST if you are in the mood for brunch. Chicago Diner makes seitan taste so good, it is actually illegal in 7 states! Let's be honest, there isn't a bad thing on the menu. Having recently moved to San Francisco, I really, really miss this restaurant. I actually have dreams about it...I usually wake up from them drooling...
