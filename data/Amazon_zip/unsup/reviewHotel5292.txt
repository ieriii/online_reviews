If you are looking for a good price, this is pretty much it, but spend a few extra dollars and get a nice room, say the Doubletree. This particular Red Roof Inn needs to be totally gutted and renovated. It is terrible. It was the worst night I have ever spent at a hotel in my life and I have travelled quite a bit. Even a little motel in the upper peninsula of Michigan is nicer and cleaner than this place!  I complained and got my money back, but it took 3 weeks.  The manager was very nice and said they were going to be putting in new floors, but it needs so much more work than this! It is a shame, because it is in a great location, walking distance of the Magnificent Mile.
