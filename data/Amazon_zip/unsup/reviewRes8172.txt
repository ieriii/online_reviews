Fogo de Chao has all the standards of a Brazilian steakhouse: the salad bar, a well stocked wine cellar, and plate after plate of various meat products. Once you flip your little marker over, the staff starts its onslaught of deliciousness. Most of the meat was amazing. The rib eye tasted a little dried out; however, because the portions are small and the selection so large, they can afford to have one that's a little weak. The rest was amazing. The salad bar left me wanting for more. It was limited to bad romaine/good ice berg lettuce, a couple cheeses, a couple meats, and few randomly placed vegetables. The staff is unbelievably attentive. My water glass was always full and was asked no fewer than six times how it was going. Once you decide to start on the meat, they come with far greater frequency and if you're not careful, will end up with a very full plate within minutes. Overall a great restaurant. I would definitely go back.
