Pot au Feu was cold. Meat was chewy. Had to hunt down server multiple times to order, and get condiments. Burger was decent, but doesn't compare with Revolution Brewing or Kuma's. Pork chop was on point. Nice atmosphere and whiskeys. I'm not sure how this place gets so much hype, they must have some real connections around town.
