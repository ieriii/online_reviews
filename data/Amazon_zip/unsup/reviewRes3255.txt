Was going to give this 4 stars, for the chicken wings were really good. Fall off the bone tender, great crispness and flavor. But.. But... The last thing you'd want when the chicken cools slightly is for it to be sitting in a pool of oil. Yes, I know, it's fried food. And yes, it will have oil. But not a pool of it at the bottom. If you're that kinda food lover, then you'll love that the wings sit in oil. I couldn't help wondering why they wouldn't put it on some tissue paper to soak the oil up before saucing it...  Other than that, great bbq burger, fries and kimchi. Brought the remaining kimchi with me home... super fresh and nice.
