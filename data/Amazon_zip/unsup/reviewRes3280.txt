Here are a few comments I see repeatedly written about Crisp that I'd like to clear up: 1. "Ohmigod, the Buddha Bowl was LUKEWARM!" - Crisp's Buddha Bowl is essentially Korean bibimbap. It is served cool/room temperature (like Crisp's) or in a hot stone bowl (dol sot bibimbap). It is supposed to be this way. If you do not like this, go to a Korean joint that serves the dol sot variety. Just because American food isn't served this way doesn't make it wrong- become informed about Korean food before criticizing it. 2. "IT'S NOT HEALTHY!" - Nobody is claiming this stuff is diet food. They're a Korean-American fast food joint. They are selling fried chicken wings, french fries, onion rings, and fried mushrooms. If you're concerned about your bibimbap having a little sesame oil in it, please know that it contains vitamin e (an anti-oxidant), it helps lower cholesterol, and it also contains magnesium, copper, calcium, iron and vitamin B6. Your body needs some fat to support cell growth- if you're so concerned with a little bit of sesame oil then stop eating out and go back to frantically working out on your elliptical machine while watching in the mirror and crying.
