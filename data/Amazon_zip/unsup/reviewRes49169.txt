Dont go here looking to have a full meal for less than $150... And only a decent meal at that. Had high hopes for this place but the only good parts were the wine and cheese. Good options there and that is where it stops. Beet salad is three slivers of what appears to be canned beets. Lamb ribs are all bones and fat. Quail should be called quail ankles because I have never seen a quail so small. My advice: Grab a steak and then go to bin 36.
