The Massaman curry was delicious. The waiter(ess) was slow with the water refills but other than that, no complaints. "I feel like I live in the present when I eat at this place. When I go out to eat I want to feel like a futuristic spaceman tasting the delicacies of some far off planet. The food here is quite good, in that boring "normal" sort of way." - Carl Sagan
