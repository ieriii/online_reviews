I was quite skeptical of this place due to the fact that it is a chain, but decided to give it a try after watching it on Check Please. Now I know why it is a chain, because the original is GOOD. The handwritten menu looks homey with interesting choices and lots of seafood dishes. We ordered calamari fritt - tender and juicy and just right bruschette alla toscana - i never knew a simple combo of tomato basil cheese and ham could be so good, and not soggy linguine alla sora assonata - pasta with scallops & spinish - yum linguine al funghetto - very mushroomy and good rigatoni dei sardi ravioli con pesto pollo arrosto alla romana - need salt tiramisu - super light & fluffy molten chocolate cake - with bits of chocolate in the middle, wow profiterole - giant puffs with ice cream in the middle peanut butter chocolate cake - salty and sweet white chocolate gelato - tasted like coconut to me! in one world, DELICIOUS! The pastas were cooked al dente, which I loved, and all the sauces were good. I have to say, I thought the other restaurant from last week had more flavorful sauces, but the desserts were EXCELLENT.
