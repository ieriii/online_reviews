I wish Davanti Enoteca was closer to where I lived, but part of the charm of this place is that it's right on the Taylor Street strip of restaurants and bars by UIC. We came here for an early Sunday dinner and still had to wait...but it was completely worth it. While we waited for our table to be ready, we drank a bottle of wine from their WINE STORE, which is, by the way, GENIUS. You can get some nice bottles of wine without the traditional mark-up of a restaurant and the corkage fee is only $7. The inside of Davanti is homey and cute. Doorknobs and keys as coat hooks? Yes please. I'm also a sucker for brick walls and random posters with pig and lard humor. The food is GREAT - Italian small plates with enough time in between them for you to chat and actually enjoy your food. Even though Davanti was really busy, we never felt rushed. We loved the beet salad with walnut butter as well as the seared hearts of palm. My favorite was the marscapone polenta with the ragu of the day, which happened to be some tender pork shoulder. We got a prosciutto & cheese plate, which, to be honest, you can find at a lot of restaurants. The proscuitto e rucola pizza was also really delicious and I'm going to try to recreate it at home... This place kind of reminds me of Quartino but as I type this, I realize that I like Davanti wayyy more than Quartino in both food and atmosphere. Davanti is cozy, smaller, and unpretentious. I'm not saying Quartino is the complete opposite, but there is a rare breed of drunken yuppy that you can always count on being surrounded by when you go to Quartino. I can only handle it occasionally. Davanti, on the other hand, is a great place for a couple or a small group. You can even come alone and sit by the bar. So yes, I love this place and even though it's a little far for me, I definitely want to come again!
