This is my absolute favorite Brazillian Steakhouse in the city!! I've tried them all, Texas De Brazil, Brazzaz, Zed ... and nothing can top Fogo. They have the best customer service. The steaks are made to perfection. The salad bar is excellent. The side dishes are not over powering. Yes, it is a bit pricey, so go hungry. It's definitely worth every penny!!
