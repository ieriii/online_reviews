This is one of the best breakfast restaurants in the city hands down! First off, be prepared to wait in a long line in the morning. I've come here twice now and both times I've had to wait about 30 minutes to get a table for 4. Its definitely worth the wait! Both times I've had one of their omelette dishes and have been fully satisfied! They have a wide variety of different dishes with the whole range of breakfast foods to choose from. The dishes are usually very big! The omelette dishes come with hash browns (sprinkles with parsley, yum!) and some fresh fruit! They have freshly squeezed fruit juice with a wide variety to choose from. They also serve LaVazza coffee which is a great plus! Both times I came here it was after a night of heavy partying and I must say, the meals I had helped my recovering body!!! Prices are reasonable, staff is very nice and the setting is very nice! I would highly recommend this place for an extremely satisfying breakfast in the west loop!
