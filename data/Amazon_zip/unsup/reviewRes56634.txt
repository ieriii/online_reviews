We had a great dinner. The food was outstanding. We could not believe it when we saw a $7.00 Corkage fee on a $30.00 bottle of wine. I can understand corkage when you bring your own wine, but not when you order it from the menu. I have eaten in restaurants around the world and the USA. This is the first time this has ever happened to me.!!
