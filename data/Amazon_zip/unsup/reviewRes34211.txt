Every time I come here I say to myself, "I'm going to try something different!" WHAT A JOKE. Anyone who has tried their falafel sandwiches will never eat anything else from there again! Ok, over exaggerated but I know that this is exactly how I feel. I can't break up the love affair I have with these freaking sandwiches. Seriously. Just. Ugh. This review is solely based on the falafel sandwich. I like to say that I have a pretty large appetite, and one of these sandwiches fills me up. So with that being said... Why would you try anything else when you're only paying ~$4 for a meal? My mouth is watering. I should be a spokeswoman for this place (after I pry myself away from the norm and try new things). Every bite is a piece of magically delicious heaven. Really.
