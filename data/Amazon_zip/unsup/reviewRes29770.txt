All the servers were awesome and our server was super cool and gave us a free shake just because he was so nice. The food was tasty and not too expensive and I'm pretty sure my smile didn't leave my face once. I really liked the pictures of animals around the place which is the reason why I'm vegetarian. I definitely appreciate their plentiful vegan options. Going back for more soon
