I love you Tank Noodle. Simple Beef Pho hit the spot. We also ordered the Marinated Pork Banh Mi (only $4!), vietnamese spring rolls, and something that was similar to Thai Iced Tea (i'm not sure what they call it here). This place is super jam packed on the weekends so make sure you call ahead or go on an off time if you have a group.  Only things they could improve on is the bathrooms (ick) and the decor is a little lacking. But for good pho, i'd go anywhere.
