I heard good things about this restaurant and always see it packed with people. The first time I tried to eat here, the restaurant was closed for vacation. The 2nd time there was a line out the door and I didn't feel like waiting. Third time is a charm and charmed I was. I was able to find parking right in front the restaurant, bonus! The people working there wore some sort of camouflage clothing for the tank theme and I thought that was cute. They were all very friendly and helpful. We were greeted right away when we entered, which I found to be rare in this neighborhood. The staff was attentive and the food came out fast.  The menu is huge and it took me a while to get through it. There were so many choices in the noodle soup category alone. Other offerings include clay pot, fried rice, sandwiches, hot pot and lots more. The $9 combination egg noodle soup I had was fantastic because it was loaded with assorted seafood and meat. The $14 catfish and pork clay pot was delicious. LOCATION: On the corner of Argyle and Broadway, across the street from Ba-le. This place is BYOB.
