Great deep dish pizza. Hits the spot when you just finished your flight in. Only problem with this place is waiting. Last time I wanted to go, the line was around the corner (minimum hour wait). No pizza is worth that wait. But if you can walk in or wait 20 minutes, it's a great meal! Best deep dish I have had.
