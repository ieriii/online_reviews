After all the hype, including a Michelin star, I was looking forward to dinner at Bonsoiree.  My friend and I selected the 5-course menu: 1. Carpaccio of Tuna and Kona: 3 stars - the texture and flavor of the tuna were a bit off. 2. A Pea and Fava Bean Soup: 4 stars - served luke-warm, this soup packed the pea flavor. Unfortunately, I don't like peas but recognize that it was a well-flavored soup.  3. Scallop & Crap Motoyaki: 4 stars - my favorite dish other than dessert, it was very tasty though had a slight fishy aftertaste. 4. Lamb Chop: 2 stars - despite being best served rare, this was so rare that I couldn't even cut it. I hope it wasn't too tacky that I picked it up and ate it Flintstone-style. 5. 8 Chocolate Dessert: 5 stars - 8 bite size plays on chocolate, including chocolate milk, a peanut butter cup, a banana/chocolate combination, etc. Each was excellent; this was my favorite course of the night. In short, I wasn't impressed with the food but recognize that the menu may not have "spoken" to me. Given that Michelin, Yelp, and so many of my friends praise Bonsoiree, I definitely want to return when the menu is different. Service was excellent! They had to cancel our first reservation and recognized it appropriately.  The space is stark and smaller than I had envisioned. As a BYOB and $68 a person, Bonsioree is an affordable option among its peers.  I look forward to trying Bonsoiree again as I'm not ready to write it off just yet...
