Excellent. We ended up having to wait 45 minutes, this is what we were quoted when we added our party to the list, and this is exactly what we waited. We were able to go to the "bar" area and order coffees,lattes, etc while we waited and review the menus (reg & specials). Our entire wait was spent tryin to make a decision on what we would order...everything sounded super yum! The layout of the place is a little weird, with the servers having to battle the wait line a little to get to the dining room, but at least we could preview our food before we ordered! Ultimately, each person in our group ordered something different from the menu, and each of us was impressed with the yum-ness of the food. Huge portions, hot & fresh. Worth the wait. From the outside of the building it doesn't look like much...even the interior leaves you with a question of "where am I and why am I here". Within minutes of seeing the food service & menu, you have your answer. I will visit this place every chance I get when visiting Chicago.
