I really like coming here. It is one of those places where you can get high quality food while wearing jeans and a t-shirt, but if you are looking for a fancy special-occasion dinner, you can do that too. Basically, everybody is made feel welcome. There is an appetizer (seasonal) that is fresh avocado bruschetta, it is truly AMAZING. Outside of that, every entree that I've had has been great. The gnocchi is tasty, the lasagna is fantastic and doesn't taste like you could make it at home, the rigatoni caprese is great if you want something lighter. Really, get anything and you'll be happy. Plus, the servers are all really nice and helpful. They are more than willing to make suggestions on food and wine, and they won't just be the most expensive thing on the menu. Plus, Chef Anthony sends out coupons like crazy, so you always get to feel like you are saving some money. All in all, this is one of my most frequented restaurants in Chicago and I've never been disappointed.
