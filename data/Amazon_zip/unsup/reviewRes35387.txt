Duck duck duck duck duck duck duck... That's all I've ever really heard about regarding Sun Wah...I had the faint idea that they probably served other non-duck, possibly Chinese food items, but I knew they had some popular duck. As a duck fan, I traveled several red line stops up to Argyle from my home, which is only two stops away from Chinatown. The duck was fantastic, though admittedly one duck probably isn't big enough to serve nine people. They bring out little bao buns, sauce, and little vegetable strips to make mini-duck sandwiches that are great. Also, don't forget to get some of that crispy duck skin. I also love how they roll the duck around and carve it at the table - it's a wonderful opening number before the main attraction. But the rest of the food we got to go with that duck? Mehh...the only other standout thing I had there was the roast pork, with the curry chicken and stir fried fish filet also being decent selections. Overall though, nothing too special. While I do think it's worth the trip up here at least once, I think I'll be satisfied with getting my Chinese fix down at Chinatown.
