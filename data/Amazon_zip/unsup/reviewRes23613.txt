As soon as I walked in here I said to my husband "I already love this place." It has a very nice Greek painted walls, stucco tiles look, but without being tacky. The service was great and the food was fantastic. I highly recommend the mousaka for your main course and then they have this really good Greek version of tiramisu for dessert.
