The beer here is very good. The pizza leaves something to be desired. The pizza plus the long waits and deafening noises from the occasional live band pushes me to give it 3 stars. I have to admit I'm a crust person, and Piece's crust just doesn't cut it. The dough not the airy chewy crispness I look for in all of my pizzas (I do not like Chi-style pizzas). Their anchovies also taste a bit cheap, though I recently got the caeser salad and they were much better in there. I like how even for the classic pizza they do not put too much cheese and their sauce is very good. The beer is very tasty and the ones I've tried have a very complex flavor. I love hoppy beers and while Piece's beers aren't the hoppiest, they are still very good with the pizzas.
