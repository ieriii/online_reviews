Very Very nice place to take that special someone. We went there for my honey's birthday dinner. Food and wine was wonderful, better yet a 60%off Groupon Coupon is so worth it because they are a little pricey. Definitely a special place to impress :) Start off with Cheese Fondue, Main Course and my FAVORITE! Chocolate Fondue that is awesomest to my tummy.
