I like Brazzaz and many of my clients and guests like it because of the ambiance and it can be a wonderful experience for meat lovers. I go once a month when I'm in the mood to eat meat. Dinner is $50/per person, Salad Bar is $25/per. My favorites: the garlic steak , the warm pineapple is DELICIOUS, and the risotto. The service is great --- and hey why would I complain about guys in theme outfits bringing me meat?? The dessert choices are fab and don't forget to have a nice cup of hot coffee with your dessert. Wine selection is good... but boy talk about the mark up. I suggest going to Andersonville wines & spirits first to buy a nice bottle of wine, drink a couple of glasses, and then go to Brazzaz for dinner! You will be completely full. The crowd is always a mixture of people, which makes it lively. Parking is awful... opt for valet. If you want to go on Fri or Sat evening make a RESERVATION on line in advance. One more thing - - its not the best place for young children (although very doable).
