My review of each food item I ate: Crawfishcakes: I'm no crabcake, or, in this case, crawfishcake connosieur, but these were the best crawfishcakes (or seafoodcakes) I've ever had. Macoroni & Cheese Side: Horrible. I've tried making baked mac & cheese before at home, and mine failed in the same way Wishbone's did: bland, not cheesy and dry.  Home Fries: These are okay, salty and served with onion. Nothing really to write home about, though. Sweet tea: A little too sweet for my taste and I suspect that it might have been Arizona tea because I saw a giant bottle of Arizona tea in the fridge as I was leaving. The service was superb and exactly how a server at a casual diner should be: friendly, eager to serve and does not keep you waiting. I would bring someone here from out of town since it is nearby to where I live and a good alternative for picky eaters.
