Went for a work/birthday lunch. Could feel the sense of family in the restaurant, definitely enhanced the experience. First time eating in Pilsen, what an introduction! So many salsas, tons of chips. We got a complimentary cheese/tortilla appetizer that was killer. Our food was hot when it arrived. I ordered the Enchiladas Suizas with mole - fantastic. Good portion size - not too giant, but enough to eat and take some home. Would love to visit again.
