Popped in here on a Thursday night at 6:40ish. The place was already so packed that the wait for 2 was at least 45 minutes. But I don't count in my review, as you get this lots of places. That's informational only. My husband and I were actually able to snag two seats at the bar shortly thereafter because we're good vultures, though I did have to wrangle one away from a few portly ladies. We ordered the venison pate as a nibble to start, which was brought out pretty promptly. Except that when the waitress delivered it, she said it was duck and scurried away before I could clarify. Now, it looked like pate, but there was a duck rillette on the menu that night. It didn't look like rillette at all, but, she said duck, so I wanted to clarify. Ten minutes later (after not having been able to touch our nibble in case it was wrong), we finally get the bartenders attention who assure us it's the venison pate. Fine; but get on your servers a$$ to know what the heck is on the menu that day. Shared the gnuddi, foie gras and scallops. Scallops - perfectly cooked, but was waaaaaaaaaaaayyyyyy overshined by the large heaping of braised oxtail that came with 'em. If the oxtail is the star, nix the scallops and just have an oxtail dish, I might have appreciated it more. Gnuddi - AKA: naked ravioli. I would expect that there would be no shell, but it seemed these were deep fried to maintain the round shape? Who knows, they just didn't have much flavour. Foie Gras - this was actually pretty decent, especially the side of 'foie gras hot chocolate'. But decent does not a 5 star yelp review make. Just like a night spent with a sub par lover ,"I've had better" was the only thing I could utter after this experience. It's not "bad" - there's just nothing special there. I won't be back, nor recommend.
