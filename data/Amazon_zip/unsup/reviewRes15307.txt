Since 1994, I've been a customer of Calo's. I don't know of many places that can maintain a consistently high level of quality and service. For pizza, there is only Calo in Andersonville. (I've ordered from some of the other places, but I find myself always comparing them to Calo, so I finally just tossed the competitor's menus from my file.) Both dining in and delivery are always positive experiences. As the first go-to of the neighborhood Italian places, and for the span of time and consistency, I give them top marks. Thank you, Calo, you're doing it right.
