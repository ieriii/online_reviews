My life as a Chicago resident was Clearly Deprived - I can't believe I never had Hot Doug's. This has been the best re-introduction to Chicago life, ever. HOT DOUG'S!!! Just like on Anthony Bourdain's No Reservations... but more importantly, in my old neighborhood! How can you not love an "encased meat emporium" that has its own theme song and serves fois gras fries!? I tried both the "Jalapeno and Bacon Duck Sausage with Blood Orange Mustard and St. Pete's Blue Cheese drizzled with Honey" and the "Cherry Pork Sausage with Cassis Mustard and Cocoa Cardona Cheese" - both were phenomenal, but I think I liked the cherry pork the best. The cocoa-dusted cheese just put me over the top. Oh, and I tried a bite of the rattlesnake, which was also amazing (albiet a bit spicy). However, there is no way that anything that comes from this establishment is bad... if sausage was good for you, I'd choose to eat at Hot Doug's constantly. It was definitely worth the 1 hr. + wait in the cold to get a mouthful of this amazing meaty goodness. I Love Chicago and I Love Hot Doug's!
