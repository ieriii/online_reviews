This is the taco shack next to the restaraunt. There are 4 non-beverage items on the menu.  Taco options - steak, barbacoa(?) some kind of shredded beef, chile relleno, cheese. I've had the steak and chile relleno. The chile relleno (one of my favorite mexican specialties) was eh. But there was something about the steak that keeps me comin back. It was greasy- slightly, cilantro and onion-check, salsa- acceptable not mind blowing. All combined in a $2 package makes me happy. I used to think that a $2 taco was too expensive but that was before I started buying $3 cupcakes... For now- every time I go to the post office I find myself craving a taco.
