I would not classify this as a diner...more of a seafood shack with a kitschy feel. Although my friends who got the all you can eat crab on Tuesdays were very full, my fiance claims that the butter had no garlic in it, and I thought the crab had an odd texture. The coleslaw and Parmesan corn were great though. My fish was bland, however very fresh, I will give them that!
