Note: One person probably cannot finish the sangria pitcher. But it's worth a try, because the sangria here is amazing! The food here is very good as well, and the prices are good. My experience has been that the food usually comes quickly and the portion sizes are good as well. I'm not a mexican food connosieur but I think it's pretty authentic too. I hope to be back soon!
