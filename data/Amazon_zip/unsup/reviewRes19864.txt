As a first-time (very excited) diner at XOCO, overall, I was pleased with the entire foodie experience. Here's what I ate: Woodland Mushroom Torta http://bit.ly/aWajrh [wood-roasted garlic mushrooms, goat cheese, black beans, wild arugula, 3-chile salsa] --RUSTIC. The wood-burning oven cooking technique works absolute magic for these tortas. The crisp, crunchy bread contrasts beautifully with the textures of warm/oozy goat cheese and soft/juicy mushrooms. --TOMATO BROTH. Order it on the side. Totally worth it. I preferred dippin' this torta into the tomato broth as opposed to the 3-chile salsa. The flavours in the tomato broth are simpler, yes, but eating the uber crunchy torta slightly softened by the tomato broth just felt like a match made in heaven. Vegetables & Black Bean Caldo [woodland mushrooms, zucchini, potato-masa dumplings, black bean broth, spinach, avocado, serrano chile] --HEAT. Not temperature; spice. Not for the faint of heart! Next time I'm sick, I'm heading straight for this soup. I'm sure it's capable of curing any illness. For real. --SALTY. The potato-masa dumplings were the greatest thing about this dish. Initially thought I had bitten into a piece of plantain! However, the black bean broth was just too darn salty for me. Perhaps I'm hyper-sensitive to salt? Churros http://bit.ly/c8Pi3C --Fell in love with churros the first time I tried them in Barcelona. http://bit.ly/bKCOrs To this day I prefer them exactly the way I had them the first time: smaller in size & plain/un-sugared. Happy eating, all!
