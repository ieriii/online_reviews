Gilt is one of my favorite Chicago staples - sexy space, amazing food/drinks, stellar service. You cannot go wrong with the menu. I suggest ordering a number of plates for the table to share so everyone can experience it all - I crave the steak tartare! The cocktails are delish - and if you don't know which one best suits you, just ask Zach and after a quick flavor profile Q&A, you will have your perfect drink.
