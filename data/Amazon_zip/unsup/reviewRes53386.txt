Wow. Truly the dinning experience of a lifetime. I have a lot to say about the meal I had at Grant Achetz's Alinea. I haven't stopped talking about it for the last three days. However, so much of the fun comes from the surprise that awaits you with every course I wouldn't want to spoil anything with too many details. I'll just say; the food is art, it's theater, it's emotional, it made me laugh out loud several times, it was epic, and worth every penny. Cheers to Chef Achetz!
