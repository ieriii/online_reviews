I really like this place. Im partial to the Sturgeon when they have it. But all the fish dishes are really quite good. Also, their "comfort" food is really good too- my wife really likes their meatloaf sandwich. For the price- you can't get better seafood in Chicago- maybe not at any price for that matter.
