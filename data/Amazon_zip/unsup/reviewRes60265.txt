Shortly after posting my initial review. I received a response from the owners. The site now indicates the $15 minimum order at the start. I was impressed with the customer service of the follow up. Don't always find that. I ordered the pizza last night and it was as good as my friends had stated. I love thin crust pizza and this is amongst the best. Great pizza and customer service. Will be back for more.
