Full disclosure: I have a couple of friends in the kitchen and a couple of friends on the floor here. That being said, Frontera is phenomenal. There's not much I can say that hasn't been said already, so I'll keep the review short: excellent guacamole, great ceviche, top-notch service, and a menu that changes very often to keep things new. And man, that mezcal margarita will haunt your dreams, it's so tasty.
