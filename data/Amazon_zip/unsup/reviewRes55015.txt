Wanted to wait until I've eaten there twice to see if it was a fluke or not....The decor is great, staff has always been attentive and amazing, and I have gotten a table within 5 minutes both times.This is the only place in Chicago where I have closed my eyes and savored every bite.... the depth, complexity, just amazing.I love the chicken there... so moist and wonderful. Have been impressed with their wine list.Last visit had these gruyere doughnuts with a marscapone..... yum yum yum!!!!recommend L&E to anyone who will listen to me gush.
