Not the most incredible Italian restaurant but still REALLY good. You'll walk away painfully full and probably smiling, if only because the waiters and Chef are so friendly and sweet. They are great with taking reservations and check in on you frequently during the meal. The food is pretty good but nothing special. One thing I will say is they are very attentive and Chef Anthony always comes out to say hi and chat. He genuinely cares about his customers and appreciates their business, which is rare these days!!
