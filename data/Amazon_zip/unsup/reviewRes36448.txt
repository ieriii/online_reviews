Yay - Indie Cafe has become my new favorite Thai restaurant! I despaired last summer when I moved up to Edgewater from Wicker Park, thinking no restaurant could even approach my beloved Thai Village. Indie Cafe, however, is a horse of a different color. Where Thai Village was classic and kitschy, Indie Cafe is hip and modern -- but in a way that results in tasty food an an unassuming attitude. Here's a tip: If you dig curry, order the Indie Katsu. It's a special not usually listed on the menu, but they can always whip up a dish. It's got a generous helping of tempura chicken, along with carrots, broccoli and a bit of basil. The sauce is pleasantly spicy.
