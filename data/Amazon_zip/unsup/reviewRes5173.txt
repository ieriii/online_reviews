We had: Pork Fried Almonds with Rosemary & Garlic: Who knew almonds could become divine? This was the first time I've ever eaten whole cloves of garlic - they were cooked and seasoned perfectly. Pig's Ear with Crispy Kale, Pickled Cherry Peppers & Fried Egg: Good. The egg was delicious but the kale was a bit salty for me. Pork Neck Bone Rillette & Mostarda smear: The red sauce here was divine, rich and meaty beyond description! Pork Blade Steak with 'Nduja & Honey: Just okay. We should have ordered something else (the pork shoulder!) but everything else was so good we let the "okay-ness" of this go. Sicilian Iris: This is a ridiculous dessert. So good! Fried brioche filled with ricotta and chocolate chips - delicious without leaving you overwhelmed. The service we had was also fantastic. The waiter really knew their wine and beer and made excellent suggestions to go with what we ordered. Highly recommended. Parking is a bit brutal though!
