After reading and yearning to try it out, I visited recently on a Saturday to try some beer and go behind the scenes on a free tour. I have to say that this is on the top of my list of Brewpubs. Great service, great beer, and brewers that are friendly, know what they are doing, and have a passion for what they are doing. If you like beer or brewpubs this is a must stop. If you are into brewing it is worth the trip on Saturday to do the free tour at noon. The only criticism I have is the amount of small children here. Now this is not Revolution's fault, but it is odd to be on a tour where a husband offers a sample of beer to a wife who, at the time, is breast feeding their child...WTF??? I can't be more to the point than say great beer and a great place.
