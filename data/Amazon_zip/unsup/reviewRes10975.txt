Do you like candy for breakfast/brunch? If you do than the Bongo Room is the place for you. Unfortunately for me, I do not. It is O.K. though, because they offer some blander fair like the egg, bacon, and cheese sandwich I had. It was delicious. Some of the other items that may tickle your sweet taste buds are the variety of mimosas, think raspberry and champagne, the banana creme brulee stuffed french toast with shaved dark chocolate, and french toast that is swimming in strawberry compote.......... Rich, Rich, Rich! Since I usually love breakfast spots, especially ones that leave my mouth gaping as I watch the plates go by to neighboring tables. The Bongo Room gets minus one star for the wait. I don't mind waiting for a seat in Chicago on a nice Sunday morning, but you need to get your guesstimation right. Don't tell me an hour when it is actually two. That said, if you have not tried the Bongo Room for breakfast, you are missing out.
