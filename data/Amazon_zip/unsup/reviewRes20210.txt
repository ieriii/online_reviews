Run, don't walk to XOCO. I saw Rick Bayless on the morning news, and decided to beat the lines by going early and try their breakfast on for size. I showed up at 10:31, and was informed they were only serving pastries and hot chocolate before the lunch service began. So I waited, and came back 29 minutes later; I thought it was a little weird how they had a hostess direct you to your seat/spot in line, but whatever. The scent of steaming caldos and wood fired tortas was beckoning me. I ordered two sandwiches so I could try half of each: a wild mushroom torta with goat cheese, black beans and arugula, and a Jamon torta with cheddar, avocado and chipotle mustard. Holy SANDWICHGASM batman! I consider myself a sandwich connoisseur, and the ones I had at XOCO are definitely in my top 5 of all time. Everything here is made from scratch, and it shows; the flavors were so balanced, so delicious, the menu items so well thought out. I was overwhelmed by how solid everything was, especially given it's popularity. I also had a churro, flecked with cinnamon sugar/dark chocolate bits (heavenly), which finished off this lunch perfectly. Screw people who dock a star because they had to wait in line; there's a reason people are flocking to this place. It fucking rocks.
