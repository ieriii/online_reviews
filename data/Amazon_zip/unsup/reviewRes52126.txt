I didn't know how many locations Gino's East had until I decided to review it, so their authenticity kinda went down a notch immediately upon realizing it's pretty much a local chain and not really a singular 'institution.' The place is visually interesting inside, with basically every surface covered in tourist scribbles ... I guess the restaurant thinks they're hip or something because of this. I personally found it a bit corny and was frustrated at the lack of artistic talent in general. We ordered a big deep dish with half pepperoni and half 'famous sausage' (crumbled). Understandably, and with warning from the server, the pizza arrived at the table about forty minutes after ordering it. It was good, don't get me wrong, but I don't know if I'm totally sold on the Chicago deep-dish style thing.
