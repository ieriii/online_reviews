I have tried this spot 4 times. The food has been hit or miss; literally split between twice good and twice bad. By no means was it terrible or fantastic. What brings it down for me is the service. It has been consistently off. One night we ordered a bottle of wine and it showed up during our main course, couldn't find the server during our salad or appetizer to ask him where it was. Its interesting because most of the staff is very kind and attentive, minus the waiter/ waitresses. The food runner, hostess, water guys are all on point and on top of things. The waiters just seem a little understaffed. If you do go and it is nice out, check out their patio... it is awesome.
