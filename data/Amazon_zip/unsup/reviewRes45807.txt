I've been here a couple of times just never got around to writing a review. It's at a great location in downtown Chicago, right on Michigan Ave, so kinda a tourist trap in my opinion. However, you can get a really good seat with gorgeous views of the city, so I really recommend coming here at night if you come. If you are into Cheesecake factory, this is like it's twin, but more of an evil twin since I prefer the food at CF. The food at Grand Lux is just a a okay, it's tasty, but not outstanding, nor has it ever gotten us grossed out. The bread is delicious, drinks and desserts are HUGE, as are all the portions. This place gets packed fast, but it's really big so you shouldn't have too much trouble getting a table. If you're visiting Chicago and you want some decently priced big portion, average tasting food, and some killer night views, this is your place. If you're a foodie, you will not be impressed since our city has some other amazing options available.
