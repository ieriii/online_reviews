I have always been a fan of RC. The lobster bisque is fabulous, the sides are fresh, and the filet is amazing. The food has never been the problem.... When I was there last year my chair was placed in the pathway of heavy traffic. This caused me to get bumped by servers, hosts, and patrons. Not fun. I went back last weekend and while my friend and I were eating our bisque, the waiter decided that would be a good time to take our order. By the time we finished ordering, our soup was cold. I will go back because the food is excellent. I just might have to ask for a booth and a patient waiter next time.
