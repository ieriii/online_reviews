Spent this past weekend in Chicago and stayed (with 4 "young adults + husband). Booked two rooms, the kids stayed in one, hubby and I in the other. There was plenty of room, even with 4 in a room. Kids complained that pullout sofa was uncomfortable, as most of them are, but in the end, they slept pretty soundly as evidenced by the fact that we had to wake them up each morning!  The real draw for us was 1) location - within walking distance of Navy Pier, Michigan Ave. and many of the major attractions, and 2) free buffet breakfast and happy hour. Buffet breakfast was pretty eh, the made-to-order breakfast (omlets, etc. are a better option) and the nightly happy hour gets so crowded you almost WANT to pay for your drink if it makes the line move faster.  Also, don't go there looking for top-shelf - it ain't happening! They really should figure out some way to make this run more smoothly.  This property is somewhat older, but it is in very good condition; rooms and public areas were very clean and service was top-notch. We arrived about 2-1/2 hours before the 4pm check-in, but the rooms were ready and they allowed us to check in early. The elevators are a little on the slow side, particularly during the breakfast buffet and evening happy hour, when everyone seems to be wanting to travel at the same time.
