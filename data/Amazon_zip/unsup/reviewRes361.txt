If you're reading Yelp to decide to go to Alinea, stop reading, and just call to try to get a reservation. Amazing, once in a lifetime, incredible culinary experience. I thought that Alinea was like Moto (also amazing), but it's worlds apart - in great ways. Each course after course was spectacular.  I don't want to give 'spoilers" away on the experience, because it was just that - a great experience. Same with the food courses - since Chef Achatz changes the menu it just is a visual and I hate to type it again, but amazing.  At one point I mentioned to one of the waiters, that I was expecting a 'throw away' course, you know the course, a "non spectacular" palate cleanser or something - and he said, oh, that course is coming - so great service, sense of humor, Chef's family (and I mean that in the exceptional customer service, from every person at that restaurant works in harmony - no necessarily related).  I had a co-worker who was going 3 weeks to Alinea after me, and I didn't share a word about the place, and we both compared notes afterwards, which 3 weeks apart, some dishes were different, presentations, etc, so it's best not to know.  There isn't anything bad or negative I can say about this place. Was it pricey? It was worth EVERY SINGLE penny, and I would do it again, and plan on it.
