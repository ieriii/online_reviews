Great food and even better beer. What's not to like? If you enjoy beer or have considered enjoying beer or enjoyed beer at any point in the past, there will be something for you on their extensive, eclectic and rightfully lauded beer list. It's quite possible that you won't find a familiar name on their draft list, but don't let that deter you. Creative, thoughtful descriptions and a knowledgeable waitstaff will help steer you towards something delicious. My favorite was a drink that had the same flavor, aroma and viscosity as a cream pie, and likely the same caloric footprint. Totally. Worth it.
