Mediocre food, terrible service! About 3 weeks ago, my boyfriend and I took our friends from Spain to Wakamon for dinner, what we thought was one of the best places in Lakeview for sushi. Best place for Sushi?!!..maybe not, for the following reasons: 1. We were told the wait was 45 minutes, we finally got sat 2 hours later. The response from the nice host, "I'm really sorry for the wait, we will seat you as soon as possible," Response from unprofessional host, "I'm not sorry, it's a Friday night we're busy, all these people are waiting just as long as you." 2. One of the wait staff spilled wine on one of our friends from Spain....Red Wine! And no offer to pay dry cleaning. 3. Waitress was unfriendly 4. $8 Corkage fee...our $7 bottle of wine (probably shouldn't admit that)just turned into a $15 dollar bottle of wine. Really?! 5. When we finally got so fed up with the unfriendly service, we asked to speak to the manager. Manager's response to our complaints, "Look around, all these people waited just as long as you did for a table." When we questioned her on what she could do for the overall terrible experience and for the wine being spilled on my friends shirt -like waive the corkage fee- her response, "We're not take anything off your bill, this is how it is on a Friday night." Overall experience....Terrible!  Not worth 1 star!
