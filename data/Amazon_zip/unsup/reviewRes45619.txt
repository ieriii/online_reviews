The first thing I thought of when I walked in here was cozy. Warm, inviting, coziness that just made me want to snuggle in front of the fire with a pint or a glass of wine and settle in for the night, (yes, I did say snuggle). Dark oak, white tile, much bigger than you think and very friendly. I took a friend here for her birthday, her choice, and I wasn't complaining. Now I know they just opened up just not even a month ago, but things moved fairly smoothly. I sat at a rather large table, my friend said she invited another friend to join us, so I was sat at a 6 top, I felt bad. Here I was sitting all alone waiting for friends and taking up a large table, I mentioned to the host if a smaller table opened up I'd be happy to move, his reply? "Don't worry, just sit and relax it's your table." It made me feel, well.... welcomed and not just some shlup off the street. I eventually did move, but it was a good gesture. I started off with a pint of Guinness, (apparently they had Guinness reps come in and make sure they know how to pour a proper pint and it showed), and a cup of vegetable soup. The soup was a little bland, however I did appreciate the fact they left the seasoning up to me, though a touch more would be better. I did end up having a chicken sandwich with swiss cheese and mushrooms, very good with a ton of fries. When we moved we switched servers, I think the first one I had was a little bit in the weeds, the second was fairly attentive and friendly. The place was fairly full, groups kept coming in and the place was hopping and I'll be hopping back here soon enough.
