The boyfriend and I decided to stop here on a whim. It was about 5pm on a weekday, the place looked pretty packed inside, but we were seated quickly without having to wait at all \. We scored a spot at the outside patio (great for people watching while eating). I ordered two tacos: the rice and beans, and the spinach and broccoli. Rice and beans taco was just average. Refried beans, rice, lettuce, chopped tomatoes. I was surprised with how much spinach they managed to fit in the other taco, though. So that's a plus. Ordered a side of avocado, which was perfect without any black/brown spots. Perfectly ripe. Boyfriend ordered a pork burrito, which was HUGE! He seemed to enjoy it. Another great thing about Garcia's is that the price is sooo right! For both our meals it ran us about twelve bucks! Would probably eat here again.
