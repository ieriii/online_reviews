Yolk didnt do it for me, the food came out fast. But our server had a bad day, she looked lost and didnt want to be at work! Coffee was great and food was hot. Pancakes way to dry and taste like card board, I must say I dont go eat breakfast based on hype. I will go back and give them another shot, I think the menu has a lot to offer.
