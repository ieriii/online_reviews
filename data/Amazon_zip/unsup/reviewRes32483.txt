Not a fan. We ordered several appetizers that were pretty good. The oxtail dumplings are yummy. But, the entrees were very anti-climactic. Although some of the sushi was decent, I've definitely had much, much better. And, my noodles with blue crab was bizarre. Not asian tasting at all. It tasted like an italian seafood dish gone terribly wrong.
