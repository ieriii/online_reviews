Anyone who gives San Soo less than 4 stars has NO idea what they're talking about. I've had Korean BBQ many times growing up, but never authentic and never as good as this. Charcoal fire, grill plate, dozens and dozens of the small appetizer dishes and a killer galbi. If you're coming for 4 people, all you need are 2 galbis, and tons of OB (beer) and soju. The appetizers, rice, lettuce, sauces all come with the meal. If you're coming with more, also try the pancake, bacon and tofu soup. This is such a great place for friends to come out, have some good food, get liquored up and have a great time. The staff are extremely friendly (especially when you're drunk), and the place seems to be always busy and packed (yet you never need to wait too long for a table). Good atmosphere, good food, great times!!!!
