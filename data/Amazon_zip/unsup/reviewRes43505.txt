Yummy. I was hesitant to go to Milk & Honey mainly because I was in no mood to wait forever to eat brunch? But I'm glad I did. Had the breakfast panini (tasty) and the huevos rancheros (holy cow, delish). The only beefs, waiting in line and ordering food before seated. My friend and I were also confused by how to tip. Do you put money in the jar by the cash register or do you leave it at the table? I imagine you could do either, but we went for the tip jar :)
