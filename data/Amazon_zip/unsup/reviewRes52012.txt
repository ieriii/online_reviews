Dark. Gloomy. Graffiti'd walls. My kinda place. okay, not really. But the pizza is what matters right?  In my opinion, their stuffed crust pizza is heavenly... in comparison to Giordano's that is. Maybe it's because they put so much marinara sauce that I absolutely love love LOVE and because their crust is actually edible.  It's a must try but it's actually up to you if it is a miss or a hit.
