Due to all the hype my friend suggestied this place for dinner and I loveeee chicken wings so I couldn't resist especially with all these rave reviews! There were 4 of us and Tamia and we decided to order all together of 1 Big Buddha Bowl, 10 Seoul Sassy wings, 10 Crisp BBQ, 1 Original Buddha Bowl, and Cabbage Kimchee. I really enjoy the Seoul Sassy wings - crispy and just the right touch of flavor, extremely delicious. The 10 Crisp BBQ was good too, but a bit too much sauce, but I still devoured it. The Big Buddha Bowl had a good mixture of vegetables, but I wish there was more rice. I'm a rice and chicken kind of girl, but maybe next time I'll just order rice only, but I like eating vegetables too -- so I'm kind of in a dilemma. Our kimchee came out very late - right as we were all just about done eating and it's only a side order. (We had order it separately because I didn't realize they had kimchee.) The kimchee was alright, definitely not as good as traditional Korean restaurants. My 2 cousins and our friend also enjoyed the wings and even Tamia enjoyed it. By the end we were all licking our fingers. When we were leaving we also ran into one of the Co-Owners of Crisp and he was very nice, taking his time to talk to us and explain his concept of delivering the best wings in town! *thumbs up* I've officially been Crisp.
