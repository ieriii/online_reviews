Honestly, their chop salad is amaaaazing!! I read all the reviews raving about it, so I ordered it and it exceeded my expectations. The dressing is light and delicious and it's just so fresh and good! Plus, they sell bottles of their salad dressings, which I'm planning on buying cause it's just that awesome. Also tried their ribs, which are also super delicious, and I would highly recommend them as well. And, they have amazing fries. They're soft and flavorful. Absolutely delightful! My bf and I eat here like once a week we love it.
