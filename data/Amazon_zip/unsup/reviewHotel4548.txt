This is a place that you should se if you are in Chicago. The entrance is amazing. The lobby is huge and very ornate. I was told it just went under a $165 million renovation. Very close to Chicago Art Museum and Millenium Park. Great old hotel. Rooms are small but you shouldn't spend time in there anyway.
