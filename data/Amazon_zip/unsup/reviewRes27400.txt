when it comes to pizza... i'm always down... I went here last week and the pizza is still on my mind! The deep dish is hands down one of the best I've ever tasted! I can't wait to go back.  How can I explain their pizza? The crust isn't over buttery but has a flavor of it's own! The cheese infuses with their sauce and their italian sausage wassssss heavenly! The price was totally decent I think for a small deep dish we spent a total of 25 dollar with an appetizer! Give it a go!
