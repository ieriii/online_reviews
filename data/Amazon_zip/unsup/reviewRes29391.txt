This is hands down, my favorite thai place I've ever tried. If you like crab rangoon, you HAVE to try it here. For $4.99, you get either 8 or 10 large pieces. I'm pretty sure it was 10, but there was no time to count as we inhaled them. And as far as noodle dishes are concerned, everything here is excellent. 5 stars all the way for Opart Thai!
