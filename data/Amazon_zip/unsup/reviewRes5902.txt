This place is phenomenal. Start with the ricotta and honey mason jar, next the prosciutto and lastly the giant ravioli (although the pecorino noodles are delightful). This restaurant is quite out of the way - but definitely worth the trip. Have only been there for work lunches. Would be interested to check it out on the weekend. The atmosphere is... For lack of a better word...hip! Check it out!
