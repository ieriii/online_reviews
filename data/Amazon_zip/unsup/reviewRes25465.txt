I was in Chicago recently for a weekend visit with my good friend who recently moved from KC to Chicago. We always had girl's night out at The Melting Pot in KC, so when I finally made it up there for a visit last weekend, she suggested we go to Geja's for a good, local fondue experience. While wondering what I should wear, she told me it didn't matter because the lighting was so low you can't see anything. Wow, she was right. I could barely tell if I was skewering a piece of bread or an apple for the cheese fondue. Really, if your wait staff needs to point out what your food is with a flashlight, then maybe you should turn the lights up a tad. I couldn't even see my watch to try to time the cooking of my meat.  One thing on the menu really grabbed my attention, and not in a good way. Under the meat selections, they made a point to highlight that their beef is USDA Prime CORN FED BEEF. Uh...no thanks. Why would you point that out on the menu?! I also thought it was strange there was only one choice for the fondue, but it didn't matter because swiss is my favorite anyway and chocolate is chocolate. Everything was very good, besides the occasional cooking grease splatter, and our waitress was attentive and nice. We did have a little trouble flagging her down during dessert to ask for some bananas and strawberries...resulting in our chocolate burning. I used one of my skewers to cover up the flame myself. Overall, it was ok. I wish it had been better, but I found myself comparing it to The Melting Pot since that's what I'm used to and it came up lacking. I love to support local businesses as much as I can over chains, but Geja's definitely fell short.
