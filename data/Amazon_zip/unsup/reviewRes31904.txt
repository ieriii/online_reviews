Food was excellent and so was service, at least by our server. Very hard to get a reservation and if you're not there on time for your reservation, they won't hold out your table long for you! They also have time limit on your table, max 2 hours because next reservation is waiting. Because of the really great food, it's still worth coming back to this place, just don't be late with your reservation.
