Went in there for some Romanian food. Btw, the flaming cheese is not Romanian. The waitress was brand new, totally lost in space, extremely slow, and forgot to bring the silverware. The food was OK, but the cook must have been in love, since everything was super salty. Bring your Lasix , if you are hypertensive. The owner doesn't know his dishes, and I would recommend a trip to Romania to refresh his memory. He wasn't entertaining at all, quite the contrary, I should say, with some poor taste jokes. Since he could tell we were not happy, tried to bribe us with some free wine. Too little, too late. The bill was outrageous. Never again.The food tasted like home, minus the salt, therefore the 2 stars, instead of one.
