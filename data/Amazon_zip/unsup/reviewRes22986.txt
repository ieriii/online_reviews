I've dined in and taken out multiple times from Greek Islands and each time have been thoroughly satisfied! I'm a lover of Greek food and grew up with many Greek friends, so I'm quite picky about Greek food. While I have been to cheaper restaurants, the atmosphere is great and service is wonderful. Although the restaurant gets busy, there is always someone to help and you're never left waiting for a long time. My personal favorite is the spanakotiropita! For a healthier option, I would highly recommend the stuffed bell peppers. At some restaurants, peppers can come out soggy, but not at Greek Islands! Pair it with a salad and you're good to go! If you have friends or family coming into town, this is a great restaurant for Greek food!
