This restaurant is like every other Francesca's - good food, decent prices, good service. The only difference is that his location is really cramped and loud. If you want a nicer facility, hop on the el and go to the Francesca's on Bryn Mawr Avenue. Same great food, quieter and larger restaurant. However, we still had a great dinner and our Saturday night reservations were honored within five minutes of arriving and there was valet parking.
