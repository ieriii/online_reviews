fantastic time at gilt bar last weekend! we came to celebrate my birthday...without a reservation (oops)...but ended up finding comfortable seating at one of their loungey couch/table type set-ups. i really like the atmosphere here. the lighting fixtures are cool, and the music they play is actual good music, and isn't too loud. the drink i had (prosecco, st. germaine, and soda) was really delicious and refreshing. and george really enjoyed his gin based drink that came in a coupe glass (love!) with a sidecar. we then ordered some frites to share...also delicious. my sister and i shared the house salad, and it could have used something more in it besides just lettuce and dressing. maybe a tomato or a bit of grated cheese? onto dinner, i tried the mushroom pasta and it was very tasty. everyone else at the table enjoyed the chicken salad sandwich, the orrechiette with sausage, and the meatballs (yum!). we also had a few bottles of very delicious wine...bodegas vallobero rioja 2008 - a tempranillo (how's THAT for detail). finally, and most important...DESSERT! because it was MY birthday, i ordered the brownies a la mode with hot chocolate sauce on the side. unfortunately there was no whipped cream available, otherwise i would have been in brownie sundae heaven. nonetheless, the brownies were delicious and i enjoyed the fact that the size of the dessert was not tiny (it was, in fact, huge). we also ordered the toasted coconut and mocha cream pie and wow is that good. did i mention that everything is reasonably priced?! i will definitely be back :)
