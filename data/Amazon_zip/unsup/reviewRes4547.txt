If Kimberly Gordon sang there every night, I would be a regular. She is absolutely incredible!! Unfortunately, her trio only plays on Sunday nights as far as I know so I only get up there if Monday happens to be a holiday and I don't have to work in the morning. Her set begins at 11pm and they play a couple of sets through the early morning. She is amazing and the cover is way too low for the quality of entertainment. I would probably pay a lot more though I'm stoked about it, just the way it is. If you're into checking out local hot spots that have been featured in films, the Green Mill definitely has to be a must-see on your list. The films PRELUDE TO A KISS, KISSING A FOOL (is that what that Jason Lee/David Schwimmer film was called?), and HIGH FIDELITY all featured scenes shot within the Green Mill. And I'm sure there were others, too... This is the perfect, perfect place to bring your out of town guests. They will think you are really, really cool.
