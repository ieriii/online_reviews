This review is based on the macarons. My fiance surprised me with macarons from Alliance Bakery when I was getting my hair done at Strange Beauty Show. He knows my love for macarons. I agree with one of the reviewers-- why is it so difficult to get good macarons in Chicago? Is it just Chicago? After traveling to different parts of the world and having the luxury to taste excellent macarons (and I'm talking about Pierre Herme macarons.... he is the god of macarons, IMHO), I was always disappointed at the lack of good macarons in Chicago. Alliance Bakery's macarons look so pretty and they taste so fantastic. Ok granted, no one can beat Pierre Herme. He is after all, the god of macarons. But still, Alliance Bakery's macaron is pretty damn good! Another best part is that the macarons here are only $1.50 each. OMG seriously? I'm so glad I found a place for my macaron fix.
