I've only eaten here a handful of times, but have loved it each and every one. The first time I was there, I had the Apple Jacks encrusted Talapia with green beans and red potatoes, soup and salad. All of which was delicious.  And I'm not a seafood fan. Other times, I've had breakfast (fresh veggie omelette... yum!) and they're chicken salad sandwich.
