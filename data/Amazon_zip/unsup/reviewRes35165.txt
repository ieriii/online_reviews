Great food and service - always consistent! Shaw's also has really good specials like LobsterFest...my personal fav! I recently hosted a group there in their, "Oyster Hall of Fame" room and my group loved it! The service before,during and after the event was excellent and they loved the food! Eating in the bar area is always fun and casual.
