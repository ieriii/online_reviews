Fantastic Pizza!!! I love there signature deep dish pizza with the burnt cheesy edges! This is one of the BEST places for pizza in Chicago. The atmosphere is fine for beers and a relaxing, friendly night out. Great deals all week long! Please go when you get a chance. Heck, make an outing just for Pequod's!!!
