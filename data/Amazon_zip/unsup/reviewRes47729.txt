I know there are a lot of haters out there, can't help, I like and have fun. Okay, only ate a cheese plate and had a drink, so I cannot comment on the food. But, I'm not going there for the food. I go to hang out on the roof top patio, chill with the great view, and (like another reviewer noted) watch the cougers with trout pout. So, for some of the same reasons she's dogging, I'm raving. Lots to see, laugh at and enjoy. Plus, man (or woman) cannot live by Nomi alone. I like that management never let's rooftop get too crowded. If you want a good seat, go a bit early and enjoy the summer. And, to the comments about this place being started in the burbs, who cares, it's still a kick ass patio. And seriously, get over it. Chicago, in the heart of the midwest, isn't exactly all that.
