I just recently visited The Grand Lux Cafe with a friend.. We went for lunch. I've never been to a Cheesecake Factory so I had no preconceived idea about what it was like. I loved the decor and could spend hours looking at everything from the tin ceiling to the beautiful retro velvet seating. We got a window seat and it was fun to watch the goings on below us on the corner. It was a nice day and people were out in droves.  We had a waitress who was very attentive and quite helpful. I questioned her about some ingredients because I eat vegan and wanted to make sure I could get something for lunch. She was so accommodating to me and for that I am grateful. I had gemelli pasta with vegetables - dried tomatoes, eggplant, zucchini, broccoli and I found it to be very good but a little oily. My salad was delicious. I can't wait to go back. I loved the little loaf of warm bread and instead of butter, they brought me olive oil. It's not many restaurants you can go into that will work so hard to please you. This one does. I'll be back.
