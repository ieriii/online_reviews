Nothing new to add here. Just posting my stars. It's all about the beer. Best beers in the city (I love Belgian beer)! Actually, I hope you don't go there because it will be less crowded for me. Looking forward to the expansion. Hope that will make more room for you and your tourist parents. Seriously, don't go here.
