Had been wanted to hit this place up for weeks and finally had the motivation to get out of my apartment (which still didnt have power from the massive storms on the 4th). The counter girl was very pleasant and did a great job juggling the many diners. She suggested the seoul sassy sauce..and it did not disappoint! The "half" portion was PLENTY- the breading was just right and the chicken super tender. What blew me away, being the pop junkie that I am, was the selection of sodas...MAN! I stood there looking at the cooler completely puzzled for at least 5 min. Settled with a Diet A&W Root Beer...MMMM. I like this place. Ill be back for the burrittos!!!
