the oatmeal shake really will change your life. i am now obsessed with mastering this recipe so that i can drink one every day. a friend passed along rave reviews about the vegetarian burrito and i couldn't imagine what would be so special about a simple burrito... now i know. it was damn delicious and only 5 bucks. you have the option of adding other vegetables and i added zucchini. overall, the burrito was amazing and delicious but i don't think it needs any additions. keep it as cheap and simple as possible for maximum happiness.
