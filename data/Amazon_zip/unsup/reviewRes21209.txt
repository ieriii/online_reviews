Mmmmayan Palace. Good stuff. I finally got around to trying out Mayan Palace this Sunday night and am so glad I did. The restaurant itself is really cute and rustic looking. The service was excellent. We were greeted and seated as soon as we walked in. Throughout the night it almost seemed like we had 3 waiters. Our main waiter and two other waiters that would come around to see if we wanted refills on chips or drinks. It was great. Onto to the food...the chips I thought were a bit on the hard side but the guac was really tasty and fresh. I ordered the tortilla soup and ooohoohoohooo it was so good! Wish they would of used the chips from the soup as their dipping chips. The soup had corn, chicken, black beans, cilantro...man it was good. I ordered a combination platter. Tamale, carne asada taco and a chile relleno. Tamale was a bit on the dry side so I probably wouldn't order that again but the chile relleno and carne asada taco were really yummy. Drinks I had a mojito...not very impressed but I've yet to find a place that makes a mojito better than La Fonda. The sangria on the other hand was very good...would definitely order that again. Didn't have room for dessert unfortunately but we will be back! Next time I want to sit in the back patio which we checked out before we left. Good times!
