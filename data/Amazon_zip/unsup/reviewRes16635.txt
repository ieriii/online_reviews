So, its September in Chicago and my birthday weekend. WHAT is a girl to do???? Go to Carnivale with several of her favorite people. I must say that when you pass this place the outside does not do it justice. The bar area is colorful and fun. The dining area is just beautiful. The staff was very accommodating and the food was just plain ole good. If you are feeling low you will instantly feel lifted when you walk in the door. Oh and a Raspberry mojito won't hurt either :-)
