I'm not vegan. I'm not even close, but since I stumbled upon this place, I can't seem to stop myself from coming back. Dairy and I recently broke up and the loss has been hard on me. But at the Chicago Diner, I can get the most incredible and only moderately soy-tasting milkshakes that don't leave me with hours of nausea and stomach cramps. And did I mention that they are incredibly flavorful and thick milkshakes? From the dense yet delicious vegan cake to incredible soy chorizo filled enchiladas to seitan gyros that had even my carnivore friends satisfied and sold on the joys of the Chicago Diner, this place does not disappoint. Add in some sweet photography on the walls, the feel of a classic diner with vintage booths and a immensely attractive and friendly waitstaff, Chicago Diner is worth stopping by, vegan or not. (And for you cheese lovers out there, you can get regular cheese on your vegetarian dishes)
