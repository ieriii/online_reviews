This review is only for the Sunday brunch, which I could see from the other reviews was hit or miss. I had high hopes but ultimately the experience fell flat and I can't say I would recommend a visit here. On Top Chef, many contestants have good ideas but are not able to execute their dishes properly. My girlfriend and I shared two dishes, the Steak and Eggs and the Eggs Benedict. The skirt steak on the Steak and Eggs is covered with a thick, flavorless batter that falls off immediately when you try to cut into it. The steak was also way undercooked (pretty much raw) and had a very stringy, rubbery texture. This was probably the biggest offense of the meal and possibly the worst skirt steak I've ever had. It's interesting because in one of the reviews below mine, his/her steak was well done. The short rib Eggs Benedict was pretty good in flavor and balance, although I wasn't sold that fried green tomatoes was a good idea - the runny egg was a waste when combined with the corn batter and tomato. All the garnishes were tasty, and the eggs in both dishes were perfectly done. The brunch cocktail, the Fizz, was decent although could not really taste the bacon in the bacon infused vodka. Good value here though, unlike the appetizer we ordered. Foie, english peas, eggs - $12 for basically 5 pieces of 'deviled' eggs with a flavoured mousse inside. I probably just made it sound better than it was. The conclusion there was 'Meh, I've experienced better' which basically summarizes the brunch experience. TL:DR A restaurant where you can easily spend over $75 on brunch for two people should be able to produce a decently cooked steak.
