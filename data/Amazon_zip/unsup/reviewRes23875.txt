We finally went to Icosium Kafe! We had always been curious about the "crepes all day" restaurant on the corner of Foster and Clark in Andersonville. It was a busy evening, and there was only one waitress working - but she totally made it up for that by being super friendly, helpful and sweet. She answered our questions with no rush and promptly informed the ingredients that were sold out (it was Thursday, and she told us they have their produce delivered on Fridays). The waitress asked if we were sharing the crepes and we loved the fact they divided them in the kitchen. Very thoughtful and convenient!Savory crepes were DELICIOUS - light and supper yummy! I highly recommend the "Marrakesh" (no need for any meat!). For dessert we ordered the nutella and banana crepe. I would like to have tasted some more nutella, but it was still very good . We plan to go back soon and try more flavors. Oh the coffee was super good - I really enjoyed my latte.
