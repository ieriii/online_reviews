I don't think i'm giong to say anything that hasn't already been said in 700 reviews...This is probably the best possible Hot Dog preparation and specialty versions...In the world. If you want the best competitor in NYC, go to Crif Dog's in the East Village. They don't have the same level of Gourmet Stuff that Doug has, but it will definitely be tasty. The one thing that bums me out about this place are the specialty dogs being $7-8, if they were $5-6, i would understand, but $8!!? C'mon Doug, i know you probably deserve it, but we all don't have that kind of cash on a daily/weekly basis... :-(.
