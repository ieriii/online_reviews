This is fast becoming my favorite restaurant in Chicago. My wife and I can only afford to eat here on rare celebratory occasions, but it is a treat. Last time I tried the cornish hen. Let me tell you - I thought there was a limit on how good chicken could be. I was wrong. My wife had the lamb chops, which were also delicious, as was the gnudi (like gnochi, but better!).
