I've worked at a lot of breakfast places, and its easy to grow tired of omelets and pancakes. Once I moved to the city, I was thrilled to try out some trendy brunch places. Uncommon Ground was my first, and it was very exciting. The waitress we had was a doll, and the breakfast burrito was HUGEEEE. My boyfriend had the uncommon eggs and I almost wished I had gone with his. We both had a cup of chili as well. The boy is a red meat fanatic so I waited until after he ate the chili to tell him it was vegetarian. He loved every bite of it! A bit more expensive than I would have liked to spend on breakfast, but I know I'll be back soon.
