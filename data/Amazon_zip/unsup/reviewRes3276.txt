Thought it would be mostly hype but Crisp delivered pretty well. My roommate killed the leftovers cold the next day and was blown away (not bad for fried chicken). They also delivered it in a half hour which is rare for the city. I really enjoyed the Sassy Seoul and BBQ sauces (ask for a little more spice if you're in to that). Also got a Baby Buddha Bowl with Beef to share which was a great compliment to just having a load of fried stuff.
