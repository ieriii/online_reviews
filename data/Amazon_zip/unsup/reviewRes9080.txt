A friend and I went to try something new. I'm happy to report it was a pleasant experience. Nice atmosphere and friendly service. We started with grape leaves, hummus, and a Persian salad. I loved the salad and hummus. My friend enjoyed the grapes; they were a little too different for me. I would blame this on my taste buds and not their food. I ordered the chicken and dill rice kabob solely because the menu read "juicy chicken" . It was amazing!!! Extremely juicy! The dill rice was also very tasty. The steak was also good.
