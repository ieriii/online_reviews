Biggest plus here to me was location. It's right across the street from the Hancock building. You're right Millenium Mile so there is A LOT of shopping to be done. You're also right by one of the hop on hop off tour buses so how's that for convenience? The Lobby has been recently updated with nice seating areas and decorated with fresh orchids and other flowers. Wish the lobby was "grander" though - for a Westin, it's not a flashy or impressive first impression. Front desk staff was very friendly and efficient, as was the Belldesk. The rooms were clean and updated - granite countertops, curved curtainrods, comfy bedding. We had some issues with the wireless internet; 40% connectivity is pretty low when you're paying 12 dollars a day for internet! We had to call our own company IT as well as the Westin engineer to get up and running. Conference rooms were nice enough, no AV problems. Continental breakfast was so-so. They also did a boxed lunch which was OK. We had them cater a social event too but the food wasn't anything spectacular. Would stay here again.
