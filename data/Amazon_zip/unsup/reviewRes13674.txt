Busted my butt to get here for the Fresh Catch special before 6 PM...and it was absolutely worth it.  We got there at about 4 PM, it didn't smell like old fish, were seated right away, and had the best service all night. We were tempted to order the other fish specials, since they only have 3 different fish (tilapia, trout and catfish) for the special, all served the same way (pan fried with baby reds and mixed veggies).  Started with clam chowder - DELISH! A bit too creamy but was deliciously fresh with lots of bits of clam. Salad was a bowl of mixed greens - nothing fancy but agreeably a great traditional salad. The trout. EXCELLENT quality! Fresh, tender, moist, a FULL FISH. yummmmmmmmm. What surprised me were the sweetened pecans on top - I normally don't like my fish like this but it was a pleasant surprise. I was just glad it wasn't all over the fish. For $14, I really could not ask for more. We can't wait to come back for brunch, especially since they take reservations. Yay!
