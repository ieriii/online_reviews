It must have been an off night. Friday night and very busy. First impression? The service, for the prices paid, was awful. We got two Chef's Choice dozen clams when we ordered one. The ham sampler didn't come until - I kid you not - an hour after we ordered two of them. And there were various other service guffaws from our waiter and his helpers. The food? Really, really, really good. We sampled about 10 or 12 different things and they were top notch, though expensive for the portions. This is almost a really expensive tapas place, but with great imagination. The beer? Whoa! What a list - though, again, very expensive. Try a Mad Bitch if you have the chance - great.  The tab was on the company for our holiday gathering. If I'd paid, I'd rate 1.5 stars. I'd rate 2.5 stars since I wasn't paying :).
