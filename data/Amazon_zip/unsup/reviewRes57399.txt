I love this place!!! Tuesdays and Thursdays are the best, with half off margaritas. The staff is always super nice, and since I work in the area I go in quite often (tues and thurs!) and they always remember me. The food is great and decently priced. Always get the taco salad or quesadillas, and its always the best. Thanks Mayan Palace!!
