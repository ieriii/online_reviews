Why did I wait so long to try this fantastic, affordabley priced restaurant? Lemongrass- who knew it makes everything taste so good? I don't have a lot to compare it to but Vietnamese is clearly a cuisine worth signing about, and the atmosphere is the icing on the cake. It's constantly filled with people. And for such a busy restaurant you don't have to deal with a long wait, because the staff are usually really accurate about your wait times. No its not very trendy, and yes it can feel like a slap dash cafeteria but it's a place this friendly, and food this good but cheap you don't really care. It's just another gem that makes Edgewater the most diverse community in the city, a meeting ground for families, and garden variety South Andersonville yuppies. Eat your mint and shrimp spring rolls, drink your bubble tea, and be merry the city offers places like this to experience the food of the world.
