Sorry this is such a limited review... but had to do it... amazing amazing amazing churros. I was expecting just fried doughy cinnamon goodness, but this was so amazing. And no, I was not just hungry so everything tasted good (I had already had 2 meals in 3 hours)-- I had the 3 churros with mexican soft serve ice cream. The churros had a faint cornmeal taste but not overbearing. The consistency was still chewy with a crispy fried outside and perfectly lightly sprinkled with cinnamon sugar. Ordered with a side of cold mexican vanilla soft serve for dipping..... must I say more? get some. now. Wish there was one in Dallas :(
