What a great way to start the day! We went to Nana to taste their organic breakfast and were nicely impressed, the food was fresh and with a very good taste. Great service and reasonable prices. It is a family owned restaurant with a very nice history behind. "Nana" is the way they call their beautiful grandmother who happened to be there that day. I ordered eggs and my husband ordered the duck for breakfast, who would have thought! We both liked our choices!
