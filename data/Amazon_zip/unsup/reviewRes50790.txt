I hadn't been here for a while and we happened to be in the neighborhood so figured it would be a good place for a lazy Saturday brunch. I ordered the Mega Mimosa which I think is a combination of champagne, orange juice, mango puree and amaretto?? I could be wrong though so don't quote me. It was good although pretty sweet, I probably should have gone with the regular mimosa. I ordered the crab cakes with eggs, potatoes and a biscuit. My man got craw fish cakes and the same sides. All the food was really good, well seasoned and generous portions. I actually liked the craw fish cakes better than the crab I think because they were a little spicier. Our waitress was excellent, friendly and prompt. The wait wasn't bad, only a few minutes. I'm glad I went back and will definitely keep Wishbone in mind next time we're looking for a place to eat breakfast.
