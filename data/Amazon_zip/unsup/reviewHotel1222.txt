I would not recommend anyone stay at this hotel, unless you're attending a conference at McCormick Place. Negatives- 1. Far away from city. $12 cab ride/each-way. 2. Food in restaurants is horrible and super expensive. 3. Parking situation is crazy. They never explain to you the difference between Self park and Valet. 4. TV's are ancient. With 30 cable channels only. 5. No Wireless internet and its $9.99 a day. 6. Bed has no fitted sheet. They lay a flat sheet on mattress so by the end of the night, you're sleeping on the mattress. Gross! 7. Freezing- The hallways are kept at 50 degrees. and... NO ONE ELSE IS HERE I can't think of a pro, other then there is hot water?!?! Do Not Stay Here!
