Just good greasy fun! I love coming here with friends, filling up on OB beer and soju and ordering EVERYTHING off the menu. Don't worry about being uninitiated to Korean BBQ as the staff will help you out. Try everything placed before you and you'll probably like 90% of it. The marinated meats are sublime! I think this place is closed about three hours a week too so if you're both hungry and awake, they're waiting for you.
