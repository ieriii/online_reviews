Let me just say, mediocre. The experience of using the drive up car hop service was fun to share with the kids, the ambience gets 5 stars, but the food was just okay. We each ordered the Superdawg with everything on it. I drove 38 miles jut to try them out. No regrets, just no need to go back. My eight year old daughter said the fries could use a little more salt. I felt the hot dog bun was soggy due to "the works", and we all had trouble with it falling apart as we ate it.  I recommend going once with the kids for a fun activity, but really, the hot dogs are just good, not great, just okay, not terrible, just okay. ***they are cash only***
