Simply gorgeous, inside and out, the views, everything is just outstanding. Fabulous downtown location, breathtaking views (especially if you stay in the old tower). The bar is fun with great drinks, top notch bartenders, and comfy couch/chair seating. The chocolate restaurant/wine bar is fabulous and an experience you should definitely have. The room was huge, the bathroom was huge, everything was updated nicely, and a very large flat screen tv- the chocolate truffles were a really nice touch too! All of the staff were truly exceptional, and they went out of their way to ensure a lovely stay.
