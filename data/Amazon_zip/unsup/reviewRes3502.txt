I love fried chicken. Wait - I love anything fried. Especially deep fried. I was so excited to try this place and I was not disappointed. The fried chicken is so tasty. The meat is juicy and tender, and the breaded skin is fried to a perfect crisp.  I came here with my dad and my boyfriend and we shared half of a fried chicken and a Big Buddha Bowl. It was delicious. The ambience is cool and very laid back. I really liked the long wooden tables and benches; I have no qualms eating next to strangers.  I can't wait to come here again, and I'm bringing all my friends! :)
