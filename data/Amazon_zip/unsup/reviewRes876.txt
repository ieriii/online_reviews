If you go, expect a line, normally a pretty long line. The line is there because this place is the bomb. However, it is the best line I've every waited in. First, because it has really colorful and interesting people to talk to who are also super hyped about eating at Hot Doug's and second, because you know that at the end of the line is the best Encased Meat Emporium in the nation! Fois Gras dog is the best, but the $2 Chicago Dog is just as good. This place isn't just incredible food, but a chance to experience Chicago neighborhood culture at it's best. Go on Friday and Saturday for Duck Fat Fries nirvana. Put this place on your culinary Bucket List!
