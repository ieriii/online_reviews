Ah the perils of high expectations. I had been wanting to visit The Bongo Room for ages, but was kept at bay by all the talk of lengthy waiting periods. Let's be real, I'm not going to wait an hour for pancakes, no matter how delicious they look. I ended up free on a Friday morning, and decided to hit up Bongo Room in hopes that on a weekday there wouldn't be a wait. My boo and I hit up Bongo Room at around 9:30 on Friday morning and there was no wait at all. The place was still relatively full, but if you want to check this place out without waiting, definitely come on a weekday. I had been drooling over the white chocolate caramel pretzel pancakes since I first saw a picture of them on Yelp, so I didn't hesitate to order them. My boo has no sweet tooth and ordered some sort of breakfast croissant sandwich dealy. In my imagination, these pancakes tasted awesome. In reality, they were just OK. I definitely wouldn't get them again. They were light and fluffy, but after about half of my plate I just got sick of the taste. My boo was unimpressed with her breakfast sammich, and didn't see the appeal of the place. At the end of the day, I'd say be wary of having too high expectations when visiting The Bongo Room. The dishes all look pretty, and obviously take skill to execute, but between all the hype and the pretty pictures on Yelp something was just missing on my visit. The Bongo Room will most certainly not be taking a spot among my favorite Chicago breakfast spots. Definitely a spot for people with a breakfast sweet tooth, I'd say go on a weekday, and keep your expectations in check and you' may have a good time. I can't understand waiting an hour for this place. File under glad I tried it, but probably won't be coming back.
