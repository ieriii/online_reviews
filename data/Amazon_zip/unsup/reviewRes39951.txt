went for 23rd anniversary with friends who were also celebrating their 23rd. checked in, had a drink (beers, great selection) and then dinner. Dinner was fabulous. we ate like small plates and ordered multiple items; -tongue this was dense and ok -scallops, done perfect -cavatelli was amazing -gnocchi very very good -venison was my fav -OMG boar sloppy joe w beef fat frieds( everyone has to have this) - buffalo frog leg just tasted more buffalo sauce than anything -rabit pate, yummy and three desserts, but everyone needs to try to donuts! but how can you go wrong with gruyere donuts when you have had 6 scotches?! haahaa, great time was had by all. left for more drinks elsewhere but came back for port as a night cap.  BREAKFAST-duck hash was so flavorful!, crabs benedict was perfect, and hubby liked the market omelet. Girlfriend is in love with boar sloppy joe, this is what she had for breakfast! (amazing). This was also the best bloody mary ever. so full we were uncomfortable. we need to come back to try the other half the menu! I cant believe the wonders that come out of that small kitchen...
