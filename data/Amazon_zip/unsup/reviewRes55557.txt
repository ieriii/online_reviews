Visited this past Sat. with some friends. Crazy busy and loud, but pretty awesome! Great feel to the restaurant and the food was creative and delicious! We were told it would be a 45 min. wait but it ended up only taking 15! The hostess was unusually outgoing and welcoming for Chicago and the wait staff were quite attentive to our refills and questions. Overall, a great place for brunch!
