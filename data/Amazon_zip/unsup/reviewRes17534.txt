If you're looking for a place with a vibrant atmosphere, tasty food and rockin mojitos....look no further!! Some things I LOVE: Their guacamole - i think this rivals some of the best in the city, the Ropa Vieja appetizer - the flavor profile is unique and delicious, and the mojitos are awesome. The thing I love about Latin food is the combinations of flavors - sweet with spicy on every single thing on the menu. It's outstanding. Such a fun place too. Totally recommend it.
