Arrived on a Sunday morning, prepared for the standard Chicago wait for brunch. My party of 4 waited about 20 minutes, which I thought was not too bad, minus the cramped waiting space. After narrowing down my choices, I selected the black bean cakes, with BOTH the mango salsa & the red pepper sauce (who could pick just one?), as well as the cheese grits. The cakes were tasty, but a little dry for my liking. The sauces, however, made the dish. The mango salsa was the perfect balance of sweet and spicy, while the red pepper sauce...let's just say I would eat a bowl of this and call it an amazing soup. SO GOOD! Cheese grits were just OK, I had to add a little salt & pepper to mine to get a real good flavor out of them. my dining partners had the crab cakes, which they said were also quite good. Ooh - and the corn muffin - be sure to get it as your side! Service was a tad slow, and I understand that it's a big place, and they were busy, but our waiter didn't stop by to see how everything was until our plates were basically cleared. I guess I wouldn't have minded so much, save for the large number of whiny children seated around us...overall, I'll probably check this place out again - maybe not on a Sunday morning...too many kids!
