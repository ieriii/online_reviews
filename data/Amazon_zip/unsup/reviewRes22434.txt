First of all the service is hit or miss at this place. But it doesn't matter to me because the food is that good. This place has the best Chinese food I've ever eaten, gave me my taste for spicy food, and always leaves me satisfied. Living in Chicago I would hit up Lao's for lunch at least once a month, and almost every time I had a visitor in town we would end up here for a meal. I've since moved, but when I'm in town I try to make it to the restaurant and often bring tupperware containers in my carry on suitcase to take some food back with me. When my friends from Virginia find out I'm going to Chicago they automatically start placing their orders from Lao's. That's how much we love the food. I can't testify to the hot pot because I've never had it. I happen to be a big fan of the spicy cabbage they serve you at the beginning of the meal, and yes it is very spicy. I always always get the Don Don Noodles, spicy noodle dish that is just heavenly. Some other favorites include Dry Chili Chicken, Spicy crispy eggplant with ground pork, Lamb with Cumin, and Tony's special three chili chicken. I almost never order Americanized Chinese food here although I have had the beef with broccoli and the moo shu beef which are both good. Their pork pot stickers are also delicious. As another reviewer mentioned, make sure you order one of the more authentic dishes. You can get Americanized Chinese anywhere but I've never had better authentic Chinese cuisine anywhere else. And believe me I've looked! Get over the extra charge for rice. The food is worth it!
