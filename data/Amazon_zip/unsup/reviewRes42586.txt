Caveat: Delivery Only So, I needed something to replace my still-lamented Annette's for delivery chicken. Enter FOGO2GO. I guess they do pizza, but I already got a guy. Anyhoo, based on a strong recommendation, I ordered their whole Brazilian chicken special. From the moment I opened the door to a cheerful and early delivery guy, I was feeling pretty good about my order. I opened the box and as the aroma assailed my senses, I knew it would not disappoint. Delicious, dark, smoky, charbroiled chicken stared up at me. I ignored the plate, fork, knife and napkin I'd set out and grabbing a wing, tucked into it like a savage (or my brother) - URG! GROWL! GRUNT! MUNCH! Perfect! YUM! Just what I wanted! Standing at the counter, inhaling this divine protein, I was pretty happy. It came with a grilled pita and 2 sides - of which I chose the garlic rice & black beans, yum. I finally managed to act civilized and piled up a plate. There was so much food I had enough for the next day, too - and it was delicious re-heated, too! The only bummer is the $4 delivery fee, but of course I'll order this delicious chicken again, and maybe even remember my oh-so-delicate-flower, ladylike manners next time.
