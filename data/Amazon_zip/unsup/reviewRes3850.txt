I am so glad I found this place! This place has some of the best chicken I've ever tasted. Also, they give you so much. I suggest sharing a meal with someone as the portions they give are substantial for 2-3 people. The staff is also very friendly and accommodating. I've come back to this place over and over despite the hard to find parking in the area.
