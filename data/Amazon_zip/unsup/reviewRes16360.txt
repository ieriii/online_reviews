Just ordered food through Grub Hub. I told the guy that the order was wrong and he tells me I just talked to you and told you if you wanted this or that. Funny thing is I never talked to anyone, I ordered my food online. So right there was a fight. The food I ordered was incorrect and he fought with me if it was wrong or not. I eat at the restaurant all the time and order the same thing so ordered online what I always get but was completely the wrong food. The person I was talking to said it was not their problem to call grub hub. but hello!!! the food comes from your restaurant so it is partially your problem. The guy was such an ass to me on the phone. Customer service is definitely not a priority for them. They just completely lost a loyal customer. I'm sure they will lose plenty more if that's how they treat their customers. and I have my own successful business and if I had a customer complaint I would just resend the correct food no matter whos fault. GET IT RIGHT INDIA HOUSE!
