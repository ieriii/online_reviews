The Wheeler Mansion is an amazing bed and breakfast and has been such a great asset to the South Loop. I was truly surprised they would go out of their way to hold a free Farmer's Market every week on their grounds. The vendors were great, the music was great and a lot of tasty things to eat and buy. Can't wait to go back and support every week!! What a wonderful market at a classy venue.
