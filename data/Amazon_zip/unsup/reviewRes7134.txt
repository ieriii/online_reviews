I so wanted to love this place more than I did. The decor is very nice and the service was attentive. I like barbecue, but maybe I'm just not a connoisseur. It was good solid comfort food, but I wasn't blown away. I admit, I did love the pickles just a bit too much! The Bacon and Cheddar Hush Puppies were decent. And I enjoyed my Pulled Chicken (super tender!) and Pork Shoulder entree. However, my friend's Brisket might have been a better choice for me.
