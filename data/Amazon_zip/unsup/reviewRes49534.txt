Came here at the behest of some friends. It was a Wednesday night, and we had an 8 pm res. Our party of 8 was seated promptly and the service was very good. Not overbearing, but not absent, either. One individual pointed out that the water glasses had gone empty without a refill, but it wasn't long until the waitstaff resolved that issue. I had a couple mojitos, which were delicious. I'm hardly an expert, but it tasted as good as any other mojito I've ever had. The skirt steak, however, was remarkable. I was amazed that they could take that cut of beef and cook it a perfect midrare, and whatever brine/marinade they used was incredible. The steak was served with a fried half of a yucca, fried half of a potato, and a fried half of a plantain. Don't waste your precious belly room on the potato, but the yucca and plantain were great. I especially liked the plantain run through the leftover meat juice/brine. Perfect combo of salty and sweet. The price tag wasn't awful, but it wasn't cheap, either. Overall, I would definitely eat here again.
