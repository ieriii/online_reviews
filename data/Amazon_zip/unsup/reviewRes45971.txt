Grand Lux always manages to serve up some pretty good food, regardless of what you order on their large multiethnic menu. The space is huuuuuuuuge and super nice right above the mag mile. The prices are moderately expensive but you get what you pay for. And the staff is quite obviously instructed to be overwhelmingly friendly and accomodating to you. In a good way. I like this spot.
