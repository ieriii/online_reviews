Great atmosphere, great beer, good food, and love the vibe. Went with some friends on a Sunday night and the place was comfortably full. We all tried different beers and were happy with our selections. For apps we had bacon fat popcorn and sweet potato cakes. I wasn't a fan of the popcorn, but my friends were. The sweet potato cakes on the other hand were flavorful and a great pick. They have a nice selection for both the carnivores and vegetarians. I tried the Tempeh Reuben which was pretty good, but will probably try something else next time. They had a special chocolate cake with gelato for dessert, and it was divine. Reminded me of the chocolate stout cake I make that is always a crowd pleaser.
