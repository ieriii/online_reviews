One of the best parts of a recent trip to Chicago was breakfast at Meli. The bacon, avocado, tomato and gouda omelette was probably the best that I've ever had (granted, I rarely have them). Their home fries were perfectly fried, not overly mushy or crumbly, nor overly dry like many other places make them. The meal came with some sort of a melon that was a mix between cantaloupe and honey dew but so much better than one or the other--perfectly sweet, not sickeningly so and very refreshing. The multigrain toast was quite tasty and their sweet butter was a perfect match for it. I also got a berry smooth smoothie, which wasn't as fantastic as their food but was well balanced and well blended. I probably would have liked it to be just a little sweeter or maybe with a little less ice.
