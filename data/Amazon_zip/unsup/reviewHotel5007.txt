The staff was very helpful, patient, and eager to answer your questions! The staff is what can make a O.K. trip to a 5 star trip! Great place to stay on the corner of the loop, the mile and water front! So you can walk north and see all the cool stores and lights or back into the loop and a ton more stores plus so many places to eat you don't know which way to turn! Next cross the street your in the bean park, cool to see and walk around. The "Hard Rock" hotel is a cool looking older building with lots of great looks as of many of the buildings in the area. The staff will help you with bus info. The bus stops are within 100 yds. to all the important bus routes. Also there is a "Walgreen's" next door for the stuff you forgot. great place to buy you bus passes, drinks and maps! P.S. don't move the stuff in the mini bar it has a sensor in it that records the items as removed and bills it to your room! The cleaning staff filled us in on that! Great to know, not for your "leftovers". Found a deal on our room for $120.00 plus tax a night. @ Travel-Ticker. Took Am track in from Milwaukee 30 min. walk from union station , And no driving or parking to worry about. We will go back again!
