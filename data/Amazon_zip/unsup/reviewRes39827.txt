Here's the thing - in reviewing any restaurant, I can only highlight or point out the things that were important to me. Right now, it's important to me that when I bring my eight-month old out to a new and cool spot that I don't get treated like another yupster parent who is ruining the noshing and boozing of others by injecting a *shudder* child into the mix. Obviously, I stick to some general rules of polite parenting - get there early or late, go on an off night, leave if the kid goes nuts. And check. Those little boxes at the top of the L&E heading say it's not good for kids. I disagree. My baby got oohed and ahhed by the hosts, a high chair was brought round, and I noted quite a few other kids there ranging from fresh-born to grade school age. These are the things that allow me to enjoy my food. My drink: A classic sidecar, perfectly chilled. Starters for the table: grouse pate, meatballs with polenta, duck rillettes, Maine scallops. My favorite of these were the meatballs as I felt like this dish gives the truest sense of the food L&E does best - very stylish comfort food. Not sure what led me to choose the skirt steak as my main, but I was one of three in my party of six who did. The highlight was not the fact that the meat was cooked to perfection; rather, it was porcini agnolotti served with the dish. These little delicacies melted in the mouth and though they may have been too rich to be a meal of their own, I wouldn't have minded trying to eat my way through a bowl of them. Other raves at the table for the boar sloppy joe and chicken... Normally, I skip dessert - and I did this time too. But I'll be honest, I did stick a spoon into my sister's chestnut custard and I was happy I did. Apparently, L&E has just added a pastry chef. I approve.
