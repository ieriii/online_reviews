Yum Yum Yum Yum.....I love fish so a restaurant where most of the menu is dedicated to a large verity of the little swimmers really gets me going. The sauces are delicious and paired so nicely with the fish. The wait staff was very helpful making awesome dinner suggestions. Even when I was done with my dinner I decided to have a root beer float for desert that did me in. My stomach never hurt so badly after dinner before. I was way to full and the root beer nearly made my stomach explode. I would so do it again!!!
