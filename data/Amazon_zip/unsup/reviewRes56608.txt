Love this place! Service is great...food is awesome. The prices might be shocking, but the quality of the food and portion size make up for it. The lounge/bar atmosphere is always entertaining...you get to hear live music, you get to watch handsome bartenders (male and female :)) make drinks with dry ice, you get to watch all the beautiful people do beautiful people things. Try the tuna tartare, the scallops, of course the steaks are great, but I am a huge fan of the lamb!!!
