I was staying at the hostel across the street this past August and given the positive reviews, I had to give it a go. I'm so glad I did. Being as how I was about to spend the day at Lollapalooza, I had to load up. Can I just add how difficult it was for a notoriously indecisive person as myself to make a decision from their sizable menu?! Gluttonously, I ordered the Mana Mou skillet, a side of multigrain pancakes, and as an attempt to be "good", a wheat grass shot. The skillet was chock-full of rich yumminess; grilled steak, mushrooms, onions, peppers, and a blanket of Provolone cheese topped with eggs! Geez! Just remembering it makes my pupils dilate. I recall having a smile on my face as I was happily chewing away. The pancakes were only okay. Though when paired with the fruit spreads and that divine maple syrup, they are a-okay! One thing you HAVE to try is the spreads. They make their own preserves and....man! They put all the store bought versions to absolute shame. My only regret was not buying a jar before I left. All in all, it was a lovely breakfast. Afterwards, I waddled my satiated self to Grant Park.
