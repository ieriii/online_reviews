Best lunch in quite a while! We prepaid via g-dine for a lunchtime special they were promoting and I was rather impressed. The menu consisted of four courses for $15. I feasted on the miso soup, spicy tuna roll, shrimp and sea bass curry and mochi ice cream for dessert. They also gave us plenty of shrimp "chips" to nosh on at the table. Add a glass of bubbly and you've got yourself one perfect lunch. The spicy tuna roll was simple but quite fresh which is all you really need to be sure of. The big star of the lunch was definitely the shrimp and sea bass curry. Served with a nice side of white jasmine rice this dish was pretty amazing. Large shrimp, nice chunks of sea bass swimming in a sauce that was full of various flavors. We arrived pretty early so the lunchtime crowd was just rolling in but I think the space is great. Not overly done, not Asian infusion overload but nice touches to increase the ambiance. This is your next must dine spot for lunch!
