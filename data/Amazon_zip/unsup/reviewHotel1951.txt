We stayed here during a recent trip to Chicago. The hotel is located in the heart of downtown Chicago's "Loop" and is central to just about everything. Service was very prompt and courteous during our 5 night stay. We even got one night free for staying over four nights which was nice considering the room was over $500/night. The Lobby bar (more like a swanky nightclub/lounge) was very impressive - with vast soaring ceilings, comfortable ultra modern furniture and a live DJ. Images were being projected all over the walls as we enjoyed top notch drink service. The restaurant in the Hotel is small but perfect for lunch or an intimate dinner. The 24/room service catered to us well during the entire stay. I still can't get over the $9 bottles of water and the lack of free WIFI - but the room was spacious and the beds were UNBELIEVABLY comfortable. No real views in the entire hotel (we were on the top floor) because the building is surrounded by taller highrises. Very few complaints - The "Acura Experience" where you make a call to Concierge and have a new Acura SUV as an included car service to escort you around the city at any time was VERY nice!! Didn't have to take cabs very often. Overall I would recommend this hotel to those looking to stay in the center of everything. It is a fun place, and I can't say enough about the gracious staff or exceptional atmosphere!
