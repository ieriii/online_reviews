Wooo for good food! my parents, girlfriend and several roommates including myself were feeling hungry for some vietnamese. So we hit up this place on friday night and came in around the busy hour at 7. Shockingly, we were able to get a table in 15 minutes without a reservation. The man running out front got us seated and made sure our dinner was going well. We actually even got free lemonade and ice tea for waiting. What other place does this?? It was awesome! Free always tastes better!Onto the food, we were stuffed at the end of our dinner. The Barbeque Beef Short Ribs were amazing, simply it's beef, lemongrass chicken, pineapple callamari and tofu&eggplants were all great. The food came out on a timely manner which made us all happy. At the end of our meal we were given plates of sliced oranges, it made a nice touch. I would have given this place 5 stars but as typical for any other Lincoln Park restaurant the seating was slightly tight on a busy night. Not a big deal, but it almost made 5 stars. Still, a great restaurant with good food and service at an awesome price.
