Went here for my bi weekly dinner with friends, the wait wasn't that bad about 30 mins, the drinks were good and reasonable $3 for each whiskey I tasted several rye's. The food was pretty decent we had the pate, the buffalo frog legs, the scallops, wild boar sloppy joe, a cheese burger and the pork belly all quite good, and overall pretty reasonable priced as well. The service was good and I would recommend to others. Not a review of the restaurant but just an FYI this area is not exactly a hot bed for catching a cab, so be prepared to take other means of transportation or plan on waiting.
