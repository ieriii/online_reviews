When you think of breakfast, Greektown doesn't necessarily come in to your mind, but don't be fooled, Meli Cafe is one of the better breakfast places I've been to. It's a really nice and clean restaurant that has pretty top notch service. It gets busy in there so don't be surprised if you wait a bit for a table, but it's worth it.  I tried their corn beef hash skillet and strawberry french toast and man both were really good. The corn beef has was definitely one of the best I've had (I'm not a huge fan of it but I heard it was good from Meli's), but their french toast was the true victor. Everything blended so well together and with thick slices of toast with fresh strawberries, it was just, simply delicious. I would go back just for their french toast, and I never order french toast. I'm a eggs, meat and potatoes kind of guy for breakfast, but that french toast...my goodness.  The reason why I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the prices are a little high for a breakfast place, and they acclaim that their juices and smoothies are great, but it just was average to me.  Nonetheless, if you're in the area and need some good breakfast, go to Meli.
