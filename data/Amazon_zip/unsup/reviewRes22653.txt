are you in the mood for some steaming hot bowl of make it yourself all you can eat boiling deliciousness? If so, LOOK NO FURTHER, THE HOT POT WAS MM MM GOOD. (~$16pp +tip and tax)) I'm reserving a star because 1) haven't tried anything else from them 2) service was as others have said, a little pushy. I'm ABC too, so the waitresses and owner, I think, spoke English to us, and basically assumed that we were there for the hot pot, and instead of asking what we wanted, she just said "3 orders hot pot, right?"  3) the lamb was really gamey, not a fan. BUT the goods: 1) all you can eat hotpot comes with seafood (jellyfish, squid, fish, fish balls, mussels), meat (beef, lamb), tofu, veggies (cabbage, lettuce, green onions, watercress). Everything was SO FRESH. (didn't like the lamb tho) 2)The broth was delicious from the get go--and that's what really makes or breaks hot pot.  3) the service to refill our plates was impeccable--they asked us if we wanted more even before we waved anyone down! They even came around with a pot of hot water when the broth was getting low. They could use some better dipping sauces (they had a weak XO-like sauce--spicy seafood, sesame paste, and garlic). I would totally come back though. And we came around 8:30pm on a Thursday night and it was seriously packed to the walls, we got the last table, and about half of the people had hotpot. Get it. You know you want some steaming vat of goodness.
