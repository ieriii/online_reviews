The place has a nice selection of frying oils for french fries. My dad ordered the brisket sandwich. Mom ordered turkey, and I had the portabello sandwich. Theres a large beer list here in the larger of the two menus. The atmosphere is artsy, colorful, and tighty. Service was fast. Our server only had us and one other table when we started ordering. Then around the time we needed our check five tables filled and she was the only server around that I could see. It took long to pay her so the very alert manager came and took our cash, and luckily it was cash and we didn't need change back. She went to the table next to us and the couple had just sat down and she said I'm sorry for making you wait to them.  Nevertheless, we left her a good tip.
