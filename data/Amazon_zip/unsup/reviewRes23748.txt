I'll try to add something different that's not in the 200 other reviews. I didn't dine in, just got carry out. While I was there waiting getting the food, a few employees politely greeted me & the restaurant seemed very authentic with the Greek waiters & a good portion of the customers in the waiting area were Greek. I had a half-order of the lamb & gyros. They give you nice size portions even if you're getting the half portions. The baklava wasn't as good as I thought it would be but, it was still eatable. I'd go back next time.
