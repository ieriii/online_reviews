Everything here is great. Service is phenomenal, the cheese bread (?) is amazing. If you're not looking or willing to pay for desert, ask your server to bring you condensed milk to pour over your bananas that they serve. Its delicious!! The salad bar is always fresh and clean, asparagus is always crispy, yum. Best lamb chops and leg of lamb!!
