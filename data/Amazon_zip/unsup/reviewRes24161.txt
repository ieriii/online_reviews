This place is just a few steps from my office in Andersonville and has been a sweet addition to the block. I love building my own salads and creating meals that are better than the stuff I have at home. Plus it always comes with super yummy soup. I know a lot of people get off on the crepes but I'm pretty partial to buckwheat and blueberry pancakes so sticking goat cheese inside a pancake just doesn't work for me. Not that there's anything wrong with that... Great quick food that doesn't hurt my stomach or my wallet.
