There are a lot of great restaurants in Andersonville and Anteprima is one of them! The service, atmosphere, and wine list were the highlights for me. The food was really tasty but I wouldn't suggest ordering the salad assortment. I think it might have been better to just order a couple. I loved the beet salad and the rest of the items were just ok. This is why I gave Ateprima 4 stars. Our entree's were really tasty. My girlfriend ordered the risotto and I had a pasta with Pancetta that would have made Chef Boiardee look like a shit-head. I would like to come back and try the Coho Salmon. If anyone has had it there you have to let me know how it is. Our server made some nice suggestions for wine and the half bottle options are great if you want to try a red and a white. Also, I never felt rushed and it's always nice when the server realizes that people don't like to be asked "how are you" every 15 seconds. They were extremely attentive and constantly kept an eye on our table to make sure we were aight! This is a great place for nice night out with some good friends or just your special lady or man or lady-man.
