I came here with a group of friends on a Thursday night. First off, the music that night was WONDERFUL. They were playing some smooth jazz and R&B. We got a table in less than 5 minutes, our water before we took our coats off, and warm bread and butter right after that. However, how waiter was waaayyy too talkative. He over-explained everything. Is there a such thing as too much service?? In this case, yes. I think we talked to him more than we spoke with each other. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because my meal was TERRIBLE! I think I may have made a bad choice by ordering the chopped steak. My friends enjoyed their pasta meals, though. Like others have mentioned (and according to our waiter) Grand Lux is the more "upscale" version ofthe Cheescake Factory, although the prices are very similar. But, Lux is much more comfortable and not as dark, crowded, and loud as the Cheesecake.
