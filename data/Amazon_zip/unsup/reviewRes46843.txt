I went to Uncommon Ground last night for dinner. I ordered the risotto which I really didn't like (not poor quality, just bland for my taste). The server noted my hesitation when she asked how I liked my food and responded with 'I don't want you to have anything in front of you that you don't LOVE.' She replaced my meal, no questions asked. Additionally, the manager came over to apologize and check in. Kudos, great server (Catherine??) for how she handled the situation and for the service standards at UG. Additionally - great decor; always exciting, fun food fusions; 1/2 price wine on Thursdays; and live music.
