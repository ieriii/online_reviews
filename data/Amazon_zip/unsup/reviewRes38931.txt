No frills, Old Skool Italian joint. Strolled in with my Pops and daughter on Fr night. Was packed when we left which is always a good sign. Jackie waited on us and was a talker(which matched well with my Dad who is a talker). Since it was Fr, we went with the fish specials. Stuffed Snapper for me and Halibut for Pops. Both were pretty decent and the price was right. Plus you get a ridiculous amount of bread, soup, and a salad bar. And salad bar was pretty good with marinated mushrooms and pasta salads. And the little one got a personal pizza that was fantastic. It's basically my Pops new fav place so I'm sure we will be back alot.
