I took my wife to Piccolo Sogno for her birthday. We had mentioned trying PS for years since it always 'looked' nice when we drove by it. I feel pretty lucky having had the experience.  We ordered pasta appetizers, chestnut farfalle with wild boar ragu and spicy shrimp fettucini. Both delicious. Fresh pasta and amazing sauces. Amazing. For secondi, we had the 'bronzene' - Whole wood-oven roasted seabass. I told my wife this was the best piece of fish I had ever put in my mouth. The fish was so tender and falling apart our server de-boned the fish on our table with a tablespoon. It was melt-in-your-mouth glorious. Thank you PS, I don't think I'll ever forget the dinner I ate March 1, 2011 for my beautiful wife's 27th birthday!
