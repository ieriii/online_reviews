Let me just start by saying, I love Restaurant Week! Without it, I'd probably be scared off by the price and miss out on copious amounts of delicious meat. The salad bar is nice and all but when I go, I tend to focus on the meat. My favorites are the picanha, sausage, filet mignon and lamb chops. I took off a star because I think it's a bit overpriced. With discounts (either for restaurant week or any number of coupons they send out) it's reasonably priced and those are the best times to go. Texas de Brazil is definitely worth a try. And if you're like me, you may find yourself coming back more and more often.
