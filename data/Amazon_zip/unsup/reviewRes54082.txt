This place is definitely my style. My friend and I walked in here and immediately felt at home being of the goth persuasion as far as our high-school roots go. Even though the drinks were a little pricey for us, we came prepared and were completely satisfied with every single thing we ordered because of its perfection. I feel like this is the kind of place where you would meet some strange and interesting people with amazing life stories. I would feel comfortable sitting here reading or writing poetry - it's just an awesome and dark and mysterious little place. I highly recommend it!
