Makes me feel like home.Peking duck was MAGNIFICENT. This is as close to China as you can get in Chicago. There's side table service where they slice the skin for you. THe duck soup and fried rice that comes w/ it is marvelous, just nice. We also ordered steamed fish, pork ribs peking style. There were 5 of us and it was only $16.50 each person for all those feast!Cheap, reliable. If you dun mind the place looking a bit asian standard (not much decorations). It's awesome
