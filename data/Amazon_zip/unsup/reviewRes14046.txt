Beer: Had the Workingman Mild which was good/okay. The Willy was pretty damn good. I'm not a beer snob, so take my review there with some grains of salt. Food: had the mussels which were fantastic - the sauce was amazing for dipping those toasts into. The bacon fat popcorn was greasy and salty and cheesy and wonderful. The mushroom pizza had great flavor but was undercooked a bit so that the center was mushy. The layout, service, and atmosphere are great. Can't wait to go back!
