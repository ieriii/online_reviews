FANTASTIC Margaritas at Mayan Palace. They have a special on a certain weekday (I cannot remember which day) where the margs. are dirt cheap-not that nice dark nutrient rich dirt, like Lincoln Park dirt. The food has always been good. There is a lack of parking, but what's new? The great service will always keep me coming back.
