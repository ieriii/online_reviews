Stopped in here two nights ago for a quick bite with an out of town family member. I'd never been here before but she was staying at the Marriott and we wanted somewhere nearby. When we arrived the restaurant was packed, but we were actually able to get a table about 25 minutes later. There was outdoor terrace seating within an enclosed tent setup for winter. There were large space heaters so the area was actually quite warm, but with everyone walking in and out of the restaurant itself, we decided that sitting inside would be less hectic.Most of the plates are small and so you'd want to order about 2-3 plate a person. We went with the mixed green salad to start, it had an unusual but yummy mint red wine dressing. If was super fresh and we devoured it. We also ordered the cheese plate which is furnished by Pastoral Artisan Cheese Shop. Next we had the prosciutto bread balls, which were good, not great. They were less flavorful than we expected. Finally, we had the milk braised pork shoulder... it was by far the most delicious part of the meal. So tender that you could break it up with the side of your fork. The mashed potatoes were buttery, delicious, and very smooth. It was the perfect way to wrap up the meal!Overall a really great experience!
