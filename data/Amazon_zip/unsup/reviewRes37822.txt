I'm not surprised this place is always on the Yelp! front page. It's a happenin' place with more beers than you can count on your whole crew's fingers and toes. Good luck finding a seat in the front or the back, though. Hopleaf is no secret to Andersonville hoodrats and those beyond. If you're lucky enough to score a table in the back, grab a menu and get your hands on some of the fab grub. I don't partake in the killing of sea life, but I hear the oysters are out of sight.
