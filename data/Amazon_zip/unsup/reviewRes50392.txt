I wanted to Heart this place oh so very much. I write this 3 star review with sadness.... and maybe half of why I'm so bummed is because I really had high expectations for Big Jones! Disclaimer: ** This is for a Dinner review... I will come back for brunch at another time. Let's start with the good: They have a lot of very tempting options on the menu. Cheddar biscuits really taste homemade and are ON Point! Their grits are perfect.... a hard thing to master. They have a wicked amount of speciality teas. They do have a small outdoor patio in the back. The not so good: Outdoor seating is small, awkward and you can hear everyone elses conversation even if you are not listening. The cornbread that comes out before every meal is made with canned corn. The crawfish boudin was fried to a burnt texture. The shrimp and grits lets just leave it with the grits saved this from being a disaster. The Pork shoulder, oh you nasty little devil.... you should not be served like a chopped bbq platter!! Maybe the server was just having an off day but if you are going to say "isn't it yummy" EVERYtime you deliver something to EVERYbody's table then at least say it like you mean it! Or better yet, just don't say it at all because you know it ain't yummy! We will give it one more chance for brunch but they really need to get it together because I doubt they can sustain on brunch alone!
