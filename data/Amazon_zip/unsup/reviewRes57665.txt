Seriously cheap. Seriously Mexican food in west Pilsen. You can't get that much more authentic. Case in point because lots of locals eat here...that means its good. Bring in your own drinks. Get free chips and 3 different kinds of salsa. Order any number of typical Mexican dishes...highly recommend the combinacion or tacos or tamales or enchis or whatever you want. Pay less than $10. Also, the waitresses wear traditional Mexican Indian countryside garb which is amazing. Order in Spanish is preferable.
