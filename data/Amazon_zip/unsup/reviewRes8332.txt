Sigh. I wanted to love this place, because I freakin' love Neapolitan pizza, but have yet to find a place in Chicago that can do it up right. I can name a dozen better Neapolitan pizza places in NYC off the top of my head. Hell, I can name better Chicago pizzerias. I had the buffalo mozzarella pizza. I found the crust is too bready, spongy, flavorless, and chewy, the sauce was totally weak, the mozzarella didn't seem terribly fresh, and the basil portioning was skimpy. And it was ex-pen-sive. That said, the place is super cute (way larger than I expected) and the service was nice enough. Dear fellow expats: it simply won't compare to home. People who have never been east of the Allegheny: You might just like it. But genuinely good Neapolitan pizza in Chicago? The search continues.
