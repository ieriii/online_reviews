I hosted a corporate dinner here last week and it was perfect. The food was excellent and the staff made sure they did everything they could to make sure that we were taken care of. We had a private bar and the bartender always made sure everyone's glass had something in it. The food was quick to the table and tasted as amazing as it looked. Its a little hard to spot when your going down the street, maybe they should look at getting better signage out front but that's my only issue. Great place. You should go.
