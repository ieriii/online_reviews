I really have very minimal complaints and I had an excellent time and will most likely return - I'm just getting more and more particular lately with handing out 5 stars. I went to Wakamono last weekend for a small group dinner and it was basically a perfect choice. Everyone ordered a roll or so and maybe a couple of Nigiri/Sashimi and we all shared. My friend had been there before and knew immediately to order the Peter Parker roll which he kept calling a "fan favorite." It turned out to be an excellent recommendation as it was super delicious and led up to its reputation. The Nigiri was super fresh and easy to bite and pleasant to chew - this defines great sushi as far as I'm concerned. Wakamono is BYOB with a $5 corkage fee. They warn you right away that they will not serve from the bottle after everyone has finished eating so we were sure to keep a few near empty plates in front of us until we were able to finish off our bottles. The only complaints that I have or I heard were that a few people at the table would've preferred warm edamame as opposed to their cold serving. We considered requesting it warm but opted against it so I'm not sure if they would've honored our request or not. I was personally disappointed with only two minor things: 1) I like Shrimp Tempura proper and the only option on the menu was shrimp and veggie tempura and 2) I had a problem with the noise level of the restrooms. I escaped for a moment to use the restroom and make a quick phone call and the music in the bathroom was SO LOUD that I couldn't hear my friend on the other end. Otherwise, I enjoyed it very much!
