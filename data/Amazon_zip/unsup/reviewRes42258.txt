One of the best pho restaurants in the area. Decently priced and we don't usually have a problem with parking in the area. I love the spring rolls and the coffee. Besides the pho there are a few rice dishes that are pretty good. Some times service is slow, but usually it's with a smile. It's a bit harder to communicate with the staff if you don't speak Vietnamese.
