People see to love Crisp and I dont know why! I got the Seoul Sassy wings, per the Yelp recommendation. Even though it says not to call it Teryaki, thats what it is. Dont get me wrong, they are tasty! The wings are also huge! You can get by with 5 wings, for sure. My friend got the Baby Buddha and was less than impressed. I think it lacked flavor. The other friend got the Fish sandwich, and while the price was right, it looked like something you could get from McDonalds (Fries taste like MCDonalds also - which is a good thing!). Booo. The upsides - The food is fresh and cooked to order! The owners are extremely helpful and will dissect the menu for you. Also, huge plus - THEY HAVE DIET CREAM SODA! YES! I would go back again and get the sandwich or a burrito. As for the wings, I would rather go to a sports bar. Sorry Crisp, too many good restaurants in Chicago to waste time here. Good idea, mediocre execution.
