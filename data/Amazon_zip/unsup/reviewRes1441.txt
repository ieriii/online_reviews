I'll admit that i've waited in line at hot doug's...a few times... and i'll admit that it was worth it...every time.. Being that i am a vegetarian, I ate several veggie corn dogs. Really do not agree with the kangaroo meat...or how excited people got over it. sick. duck fat fries? uuuuuuuuuugh. BUT....doug is a gem, and he is always there to greet you. great service every time, consistant, and fun atmosphere. let's love hot doug's one and all.
