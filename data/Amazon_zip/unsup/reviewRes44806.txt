Being from southern Illinois, and parents that didn't travel much. we took one family trip to Hannibal, mo. that's it. the closest i have come to Chicago style pizza is from Pizza Hut in the 80's. not good! so i swore off what i thought was Chicago style pizza. then, 20 years later, a friend of mine had to go to Chicago to take a class. Her Boyfriend couldn't go so she asked me to go. we tried Giordano's. OMG I know what i am missing out on now. all cheesy and stuff. took forever but well worth it. beginning of the summer i went to Chicago and could not find anyplace the the suburbs that sold the pizza. maybe next time
