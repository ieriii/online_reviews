This place is fantastic! We went on a Sat night, so it was packed. While we waited for our table, they brought us iced tea. They chilled our BYOB wine in a cute ice bucket, and in general the staff was prompt and nice. The older man, maybe the owner, was so nice and friendly and obviously works hard to keep his customers happy. The food was all delicious. I will definitely be back. The only negative was that it was pretty loud, but I guess it was just because everyone was having a good time.
