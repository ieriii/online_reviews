Alright...this is food that reminds me of living on the island of Oahu. A mix of (Hawaiian) local flavors. Definitely my comfort food. . Everything is fresh and to order. The first time I was in here I placed my order and was short a couple of bucks. The owner was super nice and said not to worry about it. I was completely embarrassed but he was as cool as any island dude I knew. I will definitely be here again. Portions are made for your appetite; big or small. Fresh veggies, savor meats, everything just the way you want and innumerable combinations. The flavors will knock you out. Service is friendly and fast...you really can't go wrong.
