Wow. One of the best meals we've had in Chicago in awhile. The peasant-type bread was excellent. The pork rinds are spicy. The three types of ham platter was great.  Pickles? Wow--who pickles strawberries? They were great! So were the bread and butter pickles and asparagus. The radishes were amazing. Nice and mild, served on a vast plop of butter with sea salt. The hubby ordered the pork shoulder marinated in sherry with snap peas. Initially, he planned to bring one chop home--but he didn't :) I had the fried clams and cauliflower. The clams were great but what made the dish special were the greens. It was onion and celery in a delightful fresh marinate. It made a perfect accompaniment to the clams. We were stuffed at this point, but we had heard about the waffle. Yikes a $7 waffle, but what a waffle. Light and airy with a great flavor with a slightly crispy exterior. Honey and butter. Hubby hates rhubarb so I got the whole compote to myself :) Did anyone mention they have a zillion beers to choose from? This place is seriously good.
