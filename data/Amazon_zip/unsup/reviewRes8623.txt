Mmm Cheese puffs. Polenta fries. I really could come here just for the extras. The meat is good, really good. The salad bar is great. I just wish that I could have eaten more from it, but I was warned not to. So I didn't. They were right. Ive never laughed at a server before that night. It was a gleeful laugh, not condescending by any means. They were just so on top of everything. I also had the slight suspicion that they were listening to us via hidden microphones. Seriously. I mentioned to a fellow diner that I would like to try the fillet again and no less then 10 seconds later the waiter appeared with his sword of skewered tenderness. I talked about wanting some more cheese puffs. POOF! there they were. It was almost creepy. It was a ridiculous parade of meat. Almost anything you could think of. It doesn't stop there. You HAVE to get dessert. I had the tres leches cake and it is now my favorite dessert. Ever. Its like flan, bread pudding, cake, and mousse all in one rich delicious bite.
