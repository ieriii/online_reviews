We had just arrived in Chicago from Virginia and called Giordano's to see what the wait time would be for a table for 4. It was 7pm on a Wednesday and we were told it woould be 15-30 minutes (other places quoted me at least an hour) so my wife and I packed up our kids and quickly walked to Giordano's. When we got there, the line was out the door and the hostess informed me that it would be at LEAST an hour wait, maybe 1-1/2 hours. My jaw dropped and I explained that I had been told by one of their employees on the phone, just 10 minutes prior, that the wait would only be 15-30 minutes. About this time, another employee, Bailey F., stepped up to the podium to listened to my plea, looked at my very hungry, young kids (It was an hour past their dinner time), pulled the hostess aside and then came back to inform me that "we will fix this, we'll get you seated shortly, sorry about the mix up." 15 minutes later we were seated and giving our order to the waitress.In a world and culture where customer service is virtually extinct, and compassion is hard to come by, Bailey's act of understanding and kindness was an absolutely refreshing surprise and a great relief. She could have easily just said that there was nothing she could do and send us back out the door. Bailey, and the AWESOME food at Giordano's (the garlic bread is just as incredible as the pizza), set the tone for a great visit in Chicago. We ended up going back and that time we were prepared for the wait, it was worth it.
