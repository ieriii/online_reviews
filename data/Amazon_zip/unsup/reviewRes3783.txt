3.5 actually.....but I am feeling generous today. I went here for take out with a friend that said it was amazing. I got the original bad boy buddha with brown rice...it took like 15 minutes for them to whip up our order. I was interested to see what it was going to be like. I had never had this type of combo....well I really like spicy stuff so thankfully they had added lots of kick and put some extra in the bag because I told them I liked really spicy...people always are like, do you really like spice? And I am like....yes, I like spice...GIVE ME THE SPICY! Anyway, I took my first bite and its pretty good! Fried egg and all. I liked the brown rice because it was hearty. I dont know if I would have liked it as much with regular rice. I liked how all of the stuff in the bowl was in its own pile so you could mix it up or just eat this and then that. I mixed mine...it was good. Not to mention super cheap...less than $10 for a huge bowl thing.
