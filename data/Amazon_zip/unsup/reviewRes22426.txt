Warning: Lao Sze Chuan will ruin Chinese food for you. After eating here, you will never be able to quite enjoy cheap Americanized Chinese the way you used to. I have been here multiple times over the years, and I am yet to be disappointed. The first time I came in, I was here with friends who lived in China for a couple of years, so they knew what to order. I LOVE spicy food, and Lao Sze Chuan delivers in that category; they have things that aren't so spicy as well though. Everything I've had here is outstanding, with the hilight being boiled beef. Nothing I've ever had here has even been mediocre. I am confident I can show up, point to something at random on the menu and leave impressed. Don't miss it.
