The Drake is definetely a unique place. Or was anyways, now tht is owned by Hilton. While it is expensive, you definetely get what you pay for. The room is classy, the service is excellent but the location is really great on the lake. It probably has one of the best views and it is also great when you are doing shopping. But it is not a place for everyday stay. I would rather go with Sofitel, House of Blues or even Hard Rock Hotel which is more modern styled.
