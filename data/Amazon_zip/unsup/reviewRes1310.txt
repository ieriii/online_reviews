I'm giving Hot Doug's a 5 star rating despite the fact that we waited outside in the cold for a long time because damn they can't help the fact that they are so popular (especially with the feature on No Reservations!!1). The food I had was amazing, the atmosphere of the restaurant itself is great, and Doug and the rest of his staff are very friendly. Even waiting in line was kind of fun; everyone was excited to go in and salivating at the smell of those peculiar hot dogs. After about a 45 minute wait, my friends and I were finally able to order. Remember, it is CASH ONLY, so remember to bring some. Also, the duck fat fries are only available on Friday and Saturdays! Anyway, I ordered the Foie Gras hot dog (made with a duck sausage? with truffle sauce and topped with foie gras slices) and an order of duck fat fries. It only took about 5 minutes for it to be ready and the first bite of that hot dog was pure heaven. So delicious! So savory! So rich! The serving of duck fat fries is huge, so make sure to share it with someone; don't make the mistake of having everyone order their own because trust me, you won't be able to finish it! I had a bite of my friend's (I think it had something to do with Jack Daniel's) and it was equally as delicious. I can't wait to go back there and try the Kangaroo dog.
