This place has over 2000 reviews and a 4.5 rating so it's very unlikely that my review will have an impact. With that said, I felt like I had to review it anyway. I tell everyone I know going to Chicago to visit this place and due to the fact that it's a bit outside of downtown, I often am met with resistance. Those folks simply do not understand the brilliance of "encased meats". If I can offer you any advice, it's to try anything. At Hot Doug's, I've tried Duck+Foie Gras, Bacon+Elk, Crayfish+Pork, and RATTLESNAKE + Chardonnay. All of them have been amazing. If you're there on the weekend, get the duck fat fries because they're the best fries I've ever had. Worth the wait. Worth the hype. Hot Doug's is the best food experience in Chicago.
