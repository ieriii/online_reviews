Really like 3 1/2 stars.  Guacamole: pasty (over-blended).  Lentil soup: terrible (salty and watery).  Pozole: Weekends only, not bad (worth it).    Enchiladas with rice and beans: excellent. Service: Very good. Ambience: Nice atmosphere. A bit noisy. Food quality: Very good for the most part. Better than most of the tacquerias in the neighborhood. Neighborhood: Almost charming, Lincoln Square.
