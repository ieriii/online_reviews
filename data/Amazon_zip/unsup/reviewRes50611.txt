Delicious, delicious, delicious! We were headed for sushi in Andersonville, but in typical foodie fashion, we happened to read every menu on the windows as we walked by and this place managed to completely change our direction and draw us in. So here's what we ate: Fried green tomatoes with homemade remoulade and pickled shrimp, fresh cornbread with honey butter, pulled pork sandwich, and shrimp & cheese grits. Most everything was amazing, especially the cornbread - hello, this is me, the girl who doesn't even LIKE cornbread, but this stuff was good. It didn't have that faux-sweet flavor and let the honey butter take care of the sweetness as it melted into the piping hot disc-shaped hunks of bread. Mmm. The fried green tomatoes were also excellent to the point where I'd be hard pressed to come here and NOT eat them. The cocktails were of that interesting "Violet Hour" variety where it's not what you see on most menus, which in my mind is a plus. I mostly drank sweet tea though, which is awesome stuff. The one criticism is, unfortunately, the pulled pork. It didn't really have that signature smoky flavor. But everything else was spot-on. My advice is to go here when your stomach is growling and you absolutely need to eat becuase I left feeling HEAVY. That was a lot of butter, fried stuff, and syrup (sweet tea). Note that this is by no means a criticism of anything but my unpreparedness to go in and eat such rich stuff. Trust me, next time I'll prepare as necessary - it's worth it!
