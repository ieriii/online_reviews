This has to be the classiest and and oldest hotel I've ever stayed at. It was a great experience, excellent room service. I hate some excellent Kobe beef hamburgers, crab cakes, and salmon. The rooms were small though, but I stayed in a newly renovated room. And it was down the street from my training office.
