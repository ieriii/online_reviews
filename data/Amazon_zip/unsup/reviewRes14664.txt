It's official. I'm in love. We grabbed some carry-out for a picnic in the park. The Lechon sandwich with plantains was amazing. And the best Cuban I've had outside of Miami. Goat cheese empanada was awesome and I could've just eaten a few of those and been happy. And who can beat the value!! I can't believe it's taken me so long to come here. I'm thinking about hitting it up for lunch tomorrow.
