3 of us went here last night around 11:30. i'm surprised at all of the new late nite eats in this neighborhood now. we ate a portion of the menu so we could try many things. we tried the special which was headcheese with a quail egg. i have never had that before & the presentation made it approachable for the headcheese virgin. delicious! then we got the bone marrow-wow! the wild boar sloppy joe, which was quite yummy, the escargot pasta, the delicious pear salad, and those killer potato chips fried in beef fat with the cod spread. the moment of truth in a restaurant is usually dessert. it's when you can see what the restaurant is really made of. we had the hot chocolate cake with whip cream & it was fantastic, followed by some delicious manhattan cocktails. really great place if you are in the mood for cow cheeks & bourbon.
