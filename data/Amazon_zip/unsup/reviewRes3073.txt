I visited this place a few times and they are quite consistent. Their sassy/bbq wings are quite good but a bit overwhelming on the flavor if I eat it by itself. It tasted just right when I accompany it with the baby Bi Bim Bop. For the price, they give a lot of food. Yay! Nice place but a bit out of my way which suck.
