I hear what people are saying about the service - we've never been ignored when we've gone in, but it can be very s...l...o...w. I don't recommend popping in for a meal if you're in a huge hurry. But the waitstaff have always been friendly. I visited a couple time back in 2002, lived out of state for a while, and just got back for the first time since moving back here. The chicken riganatti is not as omfg-awesome as I remember, but still delicious. I had my first (and last) Greek coffee here way back when before I knew what Greek coffee was, so I went with the espresso martini for my after-dinner drink this time and wowie! So good - excellent dessert cocktail. The few bites of my husband's baklava that I had were sweet and nice, too. I won't begrudge anybody rating low on service issues, but the food is tasty and worth it if you've got time for a very leisurely meal.
