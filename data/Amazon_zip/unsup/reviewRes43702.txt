Chicken pot pie - NO! the best part is the bottom layer that gets soaked up in all the creamy chicken pot pie-ness, this place just put a puff pastry bow on top... disappointing. VERY disappointing Kinzie cut steak- very excellent, cooked a little bit rarer than my dinner partner requested, but still very good. angel hair pasta- good, and the shrimp was excellently cooked albeit expensive about $3 per shrimp! crab cake sandwich- decent... not too much crab cake in the sandwich. service was so-so... very busy i think, they were running around alot, so we had to wait alot in each step of the process good choc cake good ambiance, but warning sitting outside, it's really close and loud to the brown line. but still really nice outside.
