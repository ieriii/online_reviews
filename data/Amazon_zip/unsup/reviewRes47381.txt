No doubt about it, the people that work the front of house and probably own Lockdown are grade-A chodes, but as bad as that may sound don't let it dissuade you. Luckily, whomever actually does the cooking in the back knows what they're doing. I've eaten in a couple times, but prefer to order carry out. Tonight I tried ordering online and it's apparent there is a bit of a disconnect as I showed up and they didn't even know I had ordered. After 10 minutes of sitting around, they brought out the wrong order. I waited an additional 5 minutes and they got it right, sort of. Got home and realized the mac and cheese now always has bacon in it (not listed on their online menu). Ordinarily wouldn't be a problem except it was for my vegetarian wife. Disorganization aside, if you actually get what you ordered it's mighty tasty. While the burgers aren't quite as delicious as Kuma's, I'll trade off for the pleasant, if not Ed Hardy-esque service, for a close second that you can actually eat without sacrificing your evening. Sure as hell beats the completely useless staff and questionable menu cattycorner at Bite, that's for sure!
