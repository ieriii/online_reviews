Just stopped at fox and obels to pick up the ingredients for an eggplant parmesan and noticed a couple funny things: 1) They do not carry mozzarella unless it's either fresh (bleagh) or pre-grated (bleagh). I thought this was weird for the type of store they are. 2) Why the heck do you gotta put a fox and obel sticker on every effin plum tomato in your case? Do you not trust your cashiers to know the code for a plum tomato by heart? Or are you trying to trap would-be tomato thieves? I did like the jovial youth at the meat counter--was that a New York accent?
