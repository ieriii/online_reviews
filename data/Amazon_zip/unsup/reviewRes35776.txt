I really felt welcomed and warm here. The staff was attentive and nice, you'd never know they had other tables (and this was a Saturday night). I really liked our food (we had oysters and Surf and Turf). The oysters were very fresh and so was the rest of the meal. They had our table ready for us as we walked in the door, no wait. I was really impressed with the portions and thought our wine was priced and matched well. I think that good seafood prepared well is worth the price and I would go back.
