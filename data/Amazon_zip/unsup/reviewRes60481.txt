We have been here numerous times-food great every time. Won't go back though. We had a 7:30 Saturday night reservation which we changed to 6:15 late that afternoon. We arrived at 6:25 and our table was given away. Place was empty and the host said the best he could do was fit us in at 8:30. We were clearly frustrated and it was obvious the host did not really care. First, he should not have given away our reservation so quickly. Second, he could have attempted to squeeze us in sooner. This could have been handled better in a variety of ways. Restaurant owners need to have experienced managers working the front dealing with customers if they want to stick it out in the long run. Sent a complaint note to restaurant following day and no one even responded.
