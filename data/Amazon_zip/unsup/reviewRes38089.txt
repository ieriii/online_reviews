I speak only for myself when I say this but I wasn't too fond of Giordano's. I am not a fan of deep-dish pizza (except Uno's) and this visit only confirmed it. Again, I could understand why people like this place but I didn't like it for one particular reason, their secret way of making the pizza. I bet 90% of Chicagoans don't know this but Giordano's secret to making their pies is that they include a layer of dough that stays un-cooked even after the pie is done baking. Most patrons will bypass this thinking that it was a layer of cheese. Anyways, if you are in Chicago, maybe you should try it out, it is a landmark restaurant. They have a lot of other offerings so if you don't like deep-dish pizza, they have thin-crust, pasta dishes, sandwiches, etc.
