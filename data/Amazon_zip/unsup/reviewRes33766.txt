Mia Francesca was a great little Italian place. It was recommended to me by THIS site and my friend who lives nearby. Upon arrival my date and I were seated immediately...and by immediately, I mean we never stopped moving until we got to our seat. Our server was very attentive but not annoyingly so. I ordered the Halibut dish and I believe my date had the Salmon dish which she claimed to like very much. I really enjoyed the ambiance of the restaurant. It wasn't too quiet and it wasn't too loud. Some might even say it was perfect! I noticed that some people complained about the service of this restaurant...I do not understand why. I would say the service we received was impeccable! The only reason I do not give Mia 5 stars is because I usually have to visit a restaurant more than once to give it that distinction OR my whole experience must knock my friggin socks off! Mia was great but not "this is the best meal I've ever had" great. I definitely recommend Mia Francesca to anyone seeking Italian food for dinner in the Lakeview area.
