We ate at NANA last night to celebrate our anniversary. Our daughter and her friend joined us. Let me tell you, we had one of the best dinners we have ever experienced. The place has a great feel to it, warm and comfortable, but hip at the same time with exposed brick, great lighting and nice art.We began with the amazing antipasto that had the tastiest morsels of stuff we couldn't identify, but made our taste buds jump for joy! We also ordered these little brisket things that were killer! Our daughter ordered the pork shoulder, her friend the Hanger Steak, my wife the scallops and brisket, and I had the quail. OMG!!! I nibbled that little guy till almost nothing was left. Amazing!! Everyone kept raving about their dish throughout the meal. We then made it to the desert assortment plus a couple of blueberry cobblers. Unbelievable!! The little white chocolate citrus cookies were simply amazing!! Everything was perfect. Add to this a great waitress and a nice visit with the chef, Guy, and you have a perfect special dinner. It was quite a trip but well worth it. We are definitely going back!
