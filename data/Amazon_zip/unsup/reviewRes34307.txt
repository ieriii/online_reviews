No question, this place is amazing. The dinner plate is the way to go it is less that 8 bucks and can easily give you two meals. They give you so much food. Sure it is a little crammed, reminds me of a cafeteria line and is cash only. But the price and the flavor of the food makes you forget about it all and you leave full and in mediterranian bliss.
