I love BYOB and I love Mexican Food. So I guess it makes sense that Nuevo Leon is one of my favorite casual restaurants. On most nights you are greeted with some sort of complimentary appetizer. If you are lucky you will draw the pork and bean dish that they serve topped with a corn tortilla or the equally delightful chicken noodle soup.  My old standby at Nuevo Leon is the Milanesa, which is basically deep fried pounded steak served with beans , rice, and a simple salad. This dish with some warn corn tortillas makes for a yummy meal. Other highlights are the chicken enchiladas with tomatillo sauce, the mole chicken, and my girlfriends parents always order some fish dish that they enjoy.  Hmmm... The dcor is what you'd expect from a Mexican restaurant and the service is polite and typically quick. Did I mention that this place is BYOB? Where else can you have an $8 plate full of deep fried milanesa and drink a bottle of DuMol Viognier out of plastic tumblers. 1 Milanesa 1 Chicken Enchilada 1 Horchata ------------------------------- $20
