What a great little restaurant in our neighborhood up here. Even when Italian food is good, it's rare to call it special. There's something about Caro Mio that's special - maybe the fresh ingredients, but whatever it is the food is exceptional. And it's a lovely, cozy place to dine. Service is good and atmosphere has a nice little buzz about it.
