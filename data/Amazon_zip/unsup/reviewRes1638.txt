I tend to avoid establishment reviewed as "if you don't like it here, I hate u!! lmao!! zzz" But, said reviewer might be on to something here, because Hot Doug's is delicious. Just come on a weekday to avoid the line. I waited about ten minutes on a Tuesday afternoon. Why would you ever go to Alinea when you can get interesting, delicious flavor combinations at eight bucks a pop?
