So far, this is the only place on earth to which I'll return for $11 cocktails. "$11? For a mixed drink? You know you can get a huge grape-apple-tini at Fridays for $4.95?" The drinks here are worth $11 because nothing is spared in their production, and nothing gets in the way of their enjoyment. The wait staff was very attentive and made great recommendations. Nothing is pre-mixed: all the syrups, the bitters, and even the four types of ice, are made in house. The decor is dark, romantic, and understated. The cocktails themselves were revelations. I tried six different varieties on my first visit (there were three at our table and we shared). I've tried six more since. Each one brought an honestly unique set of flavors and/or textures I've never experienced before in a mixed drink. "Textures? In a cocktail? You mean like those neon-green half gallon slushee 'daiquiris' that they sell on the Vegas strip? No, no slushes on the menu during my visit. But the egg whites added a nice soft foaminess to some of the cocktails. Yes, raw egg whites; you can eat raw eggs if they've been pasteurized. And no, you don't get huge helping here, but if you order a drink presented in a martini glass, you will get a small carafe they'll give you enough for a refill. Added points for a completely non-smoking environment. Extra bonus for the only polite doorman I've ever encountered in a Chicago bar. Huge bonus for being a bar with no TVs.
