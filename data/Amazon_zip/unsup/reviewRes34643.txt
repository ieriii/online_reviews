If you like breakfast, especially eggs, this is the place for you. I am a fan of anything involving breakfast food, so this review might be skewed. The restaurant is usually busy during the weekend, so get there early if you are hungry. The house Eggs Benedict is amazing. The amount of cholesterol and calories is probably enough to stop your heart, but the intensity of the flavor explosion makes up for it. If you have the luxury of ordering two items, I would also recommend the stuffed french toast. Before I ever had stuffed french toast at Yolk, I thought all french toast had to be soaked in sugary syrup in order for it to edible. I was wrong indeed. Well played Yolk, well played indeed. Not a single drop of syrup touched it. Every heavenly bite stood well on its own. I would definitely recommend this place to everyone. However, if you are on a diet, I would recommend you go here on a "cheat day". They have healthy items choices also. I would never discourage people from coming here.
