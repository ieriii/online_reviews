This is now my official favorite Pilsen Mexican restuarant (it's also the 1st time I've dined/visited Pilsen in a very long time). Now I was suggested to another restuarant, but I got lost. But wait! what do I see a restuarant/grocery store. Typically, I wouldn't even go in but the specials caught our attention. So I walked in, took a look around, said my prayer, and placed my order. Within a few minutes I was served the usual salsa and chips (I hate tortilla chips...yeah I said it!...but seeing how my friend was devouring them I decided to give them another chance...and it was AWESOME) to my surprise a complimentary cup of fideo soup (I love free soup).I wasn't even done with my soup when my chicken breast burrito arrived. Talk about quick! It was too big for me to finish ($4.50 ppl), but was was good. My friend ordered steak tacos (sale for $1 each) we also tried a tamale of rajas con queso (poblano with cheese)..I wasn't impressed with the tamale but hey it's $1. The hocata was GREAT! (also $1). To end a delicious meal, we received a free mini dessert of a jello/flan mix. Ahhh! I will definitely make the trip and revisit again! They also offer several veggie plates,so trying the mushroom burrito next!
