This place was SO BUSY today. We came here around noon but had to come back around 1:30pm, but when we saw that the line wasn't getting shorter, we just decided to wait. We got seated fairly quickly after we decided to stay, but the line was still growing. Anyway, I ordered a combination platter because I couldn't make up my mind about what to order and my friend got a pork dish. She said it wasn't super flavorful, but my tortas and tamale were delicious. The last time I was here, I got a pork burrito that was super huge and super delicious. And the appetizers they give you before your meal are so yummy! they give you chips + salsa and a soup of sorts, along with pickled jalapenos. I like this place, and it's reasonably priced. Just wished the line wasn't so crazy on the weekends.
