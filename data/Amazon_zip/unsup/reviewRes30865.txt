My boyfriend planned a surprise birthday dinner for me and 10 of my friends. I can't say enough good things about this place. We ordered so much food and everything was great. For some of my friends, this was their first visit and they all said they could see why I love the place so much. One thing I tried this time that I didn't try last time that I would recommend is the pork belly! It's so freaking good and tender. I also tried the adobo fried rice, that was really good and flavorful. This is one of my favorite restaurants. Service was great, the place was crowded and they didn't rush us out. I also got a birthday card and a complimentary dessert. Thanks so much Sunda for making my birthday dinner special!
