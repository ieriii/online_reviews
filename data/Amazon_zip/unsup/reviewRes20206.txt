Fantastic. I must have walked by this place a hundred times and never noticed it. I'm glad a friend finally got me to try it. We were able to walk in on a Wednesday around 7pm with a group of five, but I don't think that would happen again. Make a reservation. For appetizers had: Venison carpaccio (excellent), a scotch egg (amazing), mussels vindaloo (everyone loved them, I'm not big on mussels), rabbit salad (delicious). For my entree, I decided to try the Elk, and I was NOT disappointed. Cooked a perfect medium rare, it was lean, juicy and tender. I loved it. Mashed potatoes were quite a treat, although they could probably give you a heart attack. Oh, did I mention an excellent, reasonably priced, wine list?  The Gage is definitely one of my favorite places in Chicago now.
