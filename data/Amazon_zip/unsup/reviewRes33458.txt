The food was amazing, 5 stars. The menu changes frequently to incorporate fresh ingredients. This is not your typical Olive Garden swill--MF's is authentic, light, and flavorful. I'll never forget when the bartender cracked a fresh egg over my bf's pizza, whipped it up with a fork and spooned it over the sizzling meat and cheese. The bf salivates and his eyes glaze over just at the mere mention of that pizza, even six months later. The bad reviews here mostly revolve around spotty service, which is to be expected. It's packed here. P to the acked. BF & I had made reservations, but apparently those don't mean much here. Usually I think that means a table should be waiting for us, but that was not the case. A line was already forming out the door, and it didn't look like anyone was getting ready to leave. We would have been waiting another 30 min for sure, but my man's smart. He snagged us 2 seats at the bar, and it was the best ever. Pours for drinks were heavy, and it was not a problem getting good service when you have a captive bartender!  If you go here, either go when its quiet (which would be never), or just belly up to the bar. You'll forget about it all once the food shows up, anyway.
