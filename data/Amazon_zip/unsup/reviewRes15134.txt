This place is fantastic! It's sophisticated, classy and has some deliciously strong and dangerous drinks!! It's well hidden behind a randomly painted door and past a long dark hallway, but the mysteriousness adds to the experience. I love the fact that its secluded - it makes you feel like you have access to a secret no one else knows about. I came here on a Monday night about a half hour after it opened and the place was packed. After 2 drinks our waitress disappeared on us, hinting that we should probably leave, but we ordered another round because it was just that great. (I recommend the dark'n'stormies)! By the time we actually got around to leaving, just past 10pm, there was a line out the door for people waiting to get in. It's better to get here earlier if you don't want to wait in line, but if you don't want to feel rushed it's better to arrive a little later and stand in line. Either way I give this place 5 stars! I can't wait to come back here for date night ;)
