Simply It was absolutely wonderful! We were greeted with genuine enthusiasm and the promise of complimentary egg rolls! There was maaaybe a five minute wait and I think this is how we earned our treat. The food was great. Egg rolls were delivered seconds after we were seated. Two friends had different tofu appetizers that were both lovely. As for me, my meal was served in a coconut! The Coconut and Mango Beef (Bo Dua) had very tasty, very tender, very flavorful beef tenderloin with fresh mango, young coconut meat, snow peas, and red pepper and was perfectly sweet and savory at once. The waiter may have giggled at me when I ordered it, and I get that there's a bit of spectacle to this dish (and shamelessly admit, aside from the excellent ingredients, that it helped draw me in), but goofy or not, the order was a damn good one.THEN, more complimentary goods! We were given a plate of fried bananas for having waited so long. (again, I'll say 7 minutes max) We left feeling spoiled like mad and thanked the lovely man who welcomed us so warmly at the start (seems like the owner?). He thanked us right back with the excitement I now can only expect from him. A few storefronts away, we turned back to find that he had popped out of the restaurant to wave and thank some more! And in a totally touching, genuine, not even close to overbearing way. For real.I will so definitely be back, and will try to return without expecting several free dishes, so as not to feel let down... But boy, what a first time...
