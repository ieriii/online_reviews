This afternoon my buddy and I had a hankering for Mexican food so we headed to 18th Street. Found this place by accident and decided to try it. The line was a bit intimidating but it moved quickly and soon we were seated and had water, chips, two salsas, pickled carrots and chilis, and a pork-and-pepper tortilla roll-up thingy in front of us. The menu is a lot to look at but buddy chose chicken enchiladas with mole sauce and I had chicken burrito. Both were exceptional. Service was fast and friendly. We were full and satisfied. Restaurant was packed. All this for $21. Can't beat that! Things to know though... Metered street parking only and this place does not take credit cards. There is an ATM though--$2.50 charge.
