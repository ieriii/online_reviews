I've been here a few times and I really enjoyed it. They have tons of options to customize your pizza, ranging from your choice of sauces and toppings; they've got your standard sausage and pepperoni, but also a few different things like mashed potatoes, clams, artichoke hearts, meatballs, and bacon. I've had the plain sausage as well as sausage with fresh tomatoes (I'll be more adventurous one day, I swear). Both hit the spot just as I needed and they were VERY generous with the tomatoes - each slice would have a few sections of really thinly sliced tomatoes fanned over it. It was pretty tomato-y. In a good way, of course.  A bit of a warning though, you may want to let the pizza cool for a minute before you grab your first slice because it comes out ridiculously HOT. If you try to scarf it up the second after it lands on your table you may end up with permanent, sandpapery cat-tongue!  They also have karaoke on Thursdays and live band karaoke on Saturdays. It's pretty entertaining for as long as your own karaoke threshold may be.
