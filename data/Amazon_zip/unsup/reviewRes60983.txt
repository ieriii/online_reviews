When I think of 50/fifty I think of Walden's famous last words: The world is your oyster. At 50/Fifty the worlds not only becomes your oyster, but your shining blue pearl of delight. A decadent experience that I will never forget but always cherish. When I first set eyes on this establishment I thought, "Christina, this place is paradise." Once setting foot inside, you will experience the most exquisite service imaginable. The server, will seat you, dismiss you, then up-sale you on a delighftully decadent lemonade-raspberry- cherry- mudslide. And let me tell you, it is pure perfection. Jubilation in a tall glass. Glee in a cup. Glory in goblet. The burgers? SUBLIME! Not only are they overcooked to my liking, but also slathered in a thick majo, and tossed ever-so-gently atop a stale brioche bun. What else can I say? How bout the crowd. Loud, Drunk, and Overbearing. Definitely HOT!
