I hadn't been there in a while and finally went last Sunday. I forgot how much I like this place! Despite the crowd, we were seated relatively quickly. The food was wonderful as usual... My brunch entree was the Honey Jalapeno Pork Chops which were flavorful, moist, and tender. To add to the ambience was the live latin music - a guitarist and bassist who also play at Nacional 27. If you want to go somewhere laid back on a lazy Sunday morning, Cafe 28 is nice choice.
