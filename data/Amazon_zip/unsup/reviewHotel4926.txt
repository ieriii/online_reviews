make sure that you have a wedding planner that knows what she is doing. I know the grand ballroom is beautiful! but, the service is horrible! I would rather stay at the W or The Wit Hotel. I had a bride who had her wedding here and when my assistant and I walked into the hotel with a huge wedding dress, no one cared to help, greet, or lead us in any direction. When we finally got up to my brides room there wasn't a spot to hang her dress, so we found a door and hung it over that. The hotel DOESN'T have a steamer so we had to use a small iron provided. As we were ironing, the hinge of the door touched the dress and grease smeared all over the side of the gown. I called down to the front desk to ask for a safe spot to hang a gown and they said "over a door or something" I let them know that their vintage doors, yet beautiful and elegant have spread grease all over my clients wedding gown, they told me they could send housekeeping up to try and clean the dress, i told them no and figured out a quick spot cleaning. I later found out that my bride had to carry her own bags up to her room, didn't have a welcome basket (like they do at the 4 seasons) and the catering manager still had the table settings screwed up, the wedding was in two days and the brides mother had flown in one week earlier to go over the seating, but still they had confusion. I was really shocked, i had a bride here before but only for dropping off her dress and i also did a small fashion exhibit here and was expecting so much more, i love The Drake from an architectural stand point, the service was so disappointing, a place like this should be the best in town! i really hope that this review gives them a wake up call.
