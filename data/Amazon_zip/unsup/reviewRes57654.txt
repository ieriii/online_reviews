Just as so many others have heard the raves of this establishment, it was for me a let down. I ordered pico de gallo for an appetizer and it was not fresh. I'm pretty sure it had been sitting in the fridge for some time. My main course, marinated skirt steak, was just ok, nothing to write home about. The only thing that I really enjoyed about the place was their own tortillas.
