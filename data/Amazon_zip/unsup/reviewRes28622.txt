The deepdish pizza is quite good, and the place has a very fun atmosphere. Perfect place for a group of friends to have beers and pizza and catch up on old times. The pepperoni and the caramelized crust edges are VERY good. However, the crust is too doughy, and they skimp on the sauce every time.  Upstairs is a bit quieter. This location is totally different from the boring, grandmas-house Morton Grove location. Prices on pizza are good.
