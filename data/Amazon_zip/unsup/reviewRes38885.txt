I really loved the pizza I got from La Villa. It was half green olive/garlic, half sundried tomato/black olive. . I asked for it well done and it was PERFECTLY well done. The greenolive/garlic side actually had tasty fresh garlic (not always the case with other places) and the sundried tomato/black olive side was perfection. The order automatically came with RC cola and the pizza was still was burning hot when it arrived. i will order from them again for sure. =)
