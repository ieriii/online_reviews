My favorite restaurant, period, end of story! After eating here, I quit eating Mexican food for about 6 months back home in Southern California. I was turned on to this restaurant by my wife's aunt. She knows all of the top places to eat at in Chicago. After eating there once, I went back, again, again and again, every time I visit the windy city. I typically order the Chiles Rellenos, which include 2 per plate, one seems to be stuffed with assorted cheeses and the other seems to be stuffed with a sweet shredded pork . I have enjoyed all other entrees I have tried there and have never second guess any suggestions from the waiters. Once I tried skate fish, which did not sound appealing to me, but it was terrific.  I cannot wait to try their monthly mojito drink, one time it was a fresh watermelon mojito. The next time it was a strawberry mojito. Although mojito's are typically made with rum, my favorite is their mojito served with Tequila! I love this restaurant so much, that I have been following Rick Bayless on Twitter. http://twitter.com/Rick_
