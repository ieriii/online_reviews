Greek islands is our weekly standard. Its not nouveau Greek, just simple food, and fresh fish. The more you go, they more they recognize you, and you feel like you are at home. We just moved here from NY, and we used to travel to Astoria each week for Greek food. I noticed some reviews were shocked there was no pita served. Just ask. I also asked for tzadziki, you name it, they make it happen. Its a more casual, fun (great for groups) restaurant, and my husband and I go every week because of the fresh fish and consistently great service. We get the octopus well done, Gyro salad, and whatever white fish they are serving fresh grilled, and add lemon. The wines are fun (no snobbery here- there is a great selection of causal Greek wines) and its all priced well.
