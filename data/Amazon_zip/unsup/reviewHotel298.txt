It's an old building. Noisy radiator heat, and one thing that bugged me, is that the dorrs are stiff and don't auto-close. I came back to my room multiple times to find it OPEN. Not cool. It's discrete but I'm not sure it'd be a good place to hook, as it may leave several clients feeling exposed. You must walk down a very long hallway to the reception desk.
