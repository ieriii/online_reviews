Mmmmmmm!!! This place is so yummy and a perfect brunch spot. The only reason it is minus a star is because the customer service during the wait process not so hot. My friend was not feeling great and we asked for a cup of water while we waited (for the hour we waiting... to be expected on a Sunday afternoon). She said she could only sell us a bottle. I later was able to get a glass of water from a server. (I made sure the hostess didn't see me. lol.) Other than that... the food was DELICIOUS! I just kept looking as servers would bring out food to people. Everything that came out looked so yummy. I ended up splurging (calorie wise) and got the sweet potato pancakes. I got it with a couple of scrambled eggs and sausage. The pancakes came with some cinnamon apples on top. The coffee was good with a variety of creamer options. They also had a pumpkin spiced latte. (I saw this on another table... looked scrumptious). A friend had a frittata and another had an omelet with some hash browns and pancakes. Our table was full of food, but silence occurred the moment it was put in front of us as we chowed down. None of us were able to even finish half of our food (large portions), but it was not for lack of taste.  If you are looking for a great brunch spot... check it out. There are TONS of options... both heavy and light. I am looking forward to my next time. I might try not to go during the church rush on Sunday though next time.
