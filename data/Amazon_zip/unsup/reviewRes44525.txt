I have no complains about this place. How could you? Their treats are amaaaaazzzinnnggg! An iced soy latte in the summer with a red velvet cupcake: heaven. A hot soy coco in the winter with an almond croissant: HEAVENLIER (word?) A red velvet birthday cake with chocolate butter cream frosting and layered with berry sauce: an odd combination, but AMAZING none the less! The service is always super friendly and they know what they're doing when it comes to baked goods. The coffee drinks are good, but not as good as say.. *star lounge*. And that's the only reason they don't get that extra star.
