I am a tough customer when it comes to Mexican food...chalk it up to living in California for 7 years. This is very, very good Mex. Let's start with the salsa--it definitely has a spicy kick. The burritos are so yummy (and cheap!) And now...on to the important stuff...the margaritas. They are SO strong. They will make your toes curl and blow your hair back. The atmosphere is cozy and the service is great. Definitely check it out.
