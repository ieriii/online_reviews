Ruth's Chris is an excellent steak house, in that comforting old-school way that is nice once in a while. The food is solid: excellent steaks, appetizers (try the veal ravioli, seriously), tasty sides (the potatoes augratin are great), and deserts. The last time we went, we had an excellent waiter. My boyfriend was looking forward to their oreo ice cream pie, but they had taken it off the menu, so the waiter concocted his own version with ice cream and oreo crumbles - for free. That' s service. :)
