Crepes here are out of this world. If you like crepes and strong coffee this place is for you. I've been going to this place for over 5 years and have maybe gotten 2 bad dishes the entire time. The 'Chicago' and 'Crepa Iberica' are among my favorites on the savory side, both being filling and deliciously fresh and for dessert, you can't really go wrong the 'Aziz' which has strawberries, kiwis and nutella.Icosium really understands how to generate a great flavor profile and how to keep customers coming back. This place *is* kinda pricey but I've never felt that they overcharged. Service is great, owners are lovely, and the crepes are out of this world- light, fresh and just how they should be. Plus, this place is open a bit later than most places on Clark. Keep it up Icosium!
