I rated this four stars because while I have been to much nicer hotels the Hyatt hotel is also a very nice hotel. The location is perfect surrounded by everything you need! The staff is very helpful and nice. Their beds are comfy and the rooms are a nice size. My favorite part of the hotel is their athletic/ pool area, one of the best! Its big enough for a large group of people. The pool holds a lot of people comfortably, and that it really important. I enjoyed all of their facilities including their sauna! -Dionne Gatling.
