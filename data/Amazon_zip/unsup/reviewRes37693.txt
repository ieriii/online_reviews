I don't even know where to begin. This is one of my favorite places in the city. I get an instant warm fuzzy feeling when I enter the store. Its a natural high for me. I remember the first time I walked into the store when I moved to the city---it is that special. The cheese station is amazing and you can try it all. The meat is the best I've found anywhere. The deli...everything is amazing. The breads, pastries, produce...all of it is simply wonderful. Most of the staff is friendly and helpful however I've had a couple of snotty attitudes, which is rotten for how much money I spend there, but I still keep going back for more.
