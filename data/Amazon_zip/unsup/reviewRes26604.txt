For 2 months I listened to my husband go on-and-on about how awesome this Mercat is after he went as part of a business dinner. A month ago, when the weather was a bit nicer, we decided to take a walk to Mercat for dinner. Oh man, the food here is delicious. We went with the tasting menu and could barely finish the third course. It can be kinda pricey, but in my opinion, worth it. We've gone back for lunch on the weekend and their lunch menu is definitely reasonable.
