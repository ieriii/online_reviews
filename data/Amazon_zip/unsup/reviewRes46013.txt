This is definately a copy of a Cheesecake Factory, which is not nessesarily bad, just as commercial as it gets. It is on Michigan Ave so the location is as good as it gets for a day of shopping. Kids like it. Being just like the Cheesecake Factory, it is an explosion of visual effects. Food is decent, huge and presentation is off the charts. With all the restaurants in the area, and just a couple blocks off of Michigan Ave, it is just 'A-OK.' and might only go again if kids really wanted to.
