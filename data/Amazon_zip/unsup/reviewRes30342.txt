I have avoided The Chicago Diner for brunch only because of the lines out the door, but after my late dinner experience, I cannot hold off any longer. Despite the fact that we arrived around 9:20, the place was packed. Fortune smiled upon us (as did the friendly host!) and a booth was available. Service over all was super friendly, super fast. We had our beers in no time (awesome selection), and our food came quickly too. As I am a sucker for all things Mexicanspired, I was psyched to see the enchiladas at The Chicago Diner with their deliciously spicy seitan-chorizo and big hunk of avocado slices on top. Oh, and vegan cheese, of course, should you choose it The meal was massive, so I couldn't quite finish it off, and I wanted to save room for a s'mores milkshake! (YUM.) You've won me over, Chicago Diner. I will blissfully wait in your brunch lines from here on out.
