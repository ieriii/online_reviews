I dragged my lil sis here after watching the review on Check Please. It was good, something different( the drive in was awesome).The waitresses were very polite. The food per se was average, don't get me wrong it wasn't bad. Maybe my expectations were too much. I would go back if it were on my way, I wouldn't make a detour and most definately NOT drag lil sis again.
