I was really excited to eat at Xoco on my most recent trip to Chicago, and it did not disappoint in any way. I will add at this point in my review that my hotel was just 2 blocks away. When I walked into Xoco, the line was nearly out the door. I stood in it for about 2 minutes as I stared at a sign above a cash register that directed customers to place take out orders there. So, I opted to just jump out of line, which was not really moving at all, order to go and walk back to my hotel to eat. I had the Saturday special torte of braised goat barbacoa with tomatillo pasilla (sp?) sauce and avocado and chips/salsa. The torte was unbelievable. The bread was crusty on the outside and soft on the inside, which was so yummy with the sauce from the meat soaking in. The meat was flavorful and juicy. Delicious. The sauce was smokey and the avocado provided a richness and texture that pulled it all together. The chips were tasty and delicious and they came with a red salsa and a green salsa. Although both were flavorful, I would've liked the red to have a bit more heat.  All in all, it was an amazing meal. I wanted to go back on Sunday but they were closed.
