My favorite Chicago dog, this is a must stop if you want to try hot dogs in the city. It's a Drive-In foremost, so when you pull in they will ask you if want to eat in your car or order inside, and they'll usher you appropriately in a correct type of parking spot. I opted to eat inside, so I ventured into the very tiny place to order. You order and wait in this very small narrow space and wait for your food and you pay when you pick up your food. They only take cash, but they do have an ATM. There's one thing to get here, basically -- the superdawg. At an affordable under-six-bucks, you get a box with the superdawg and as much fries they can stick in the box to go with it. The dog itself is damned delicious. My friend who has lots of knowledge about dogs in the city says that they use a special distributor for the type of hot dog they use for Superdawg, so it is a casing and flavor you can't get anywhere else, I believe. Because of this, this is a thick hot dog that is not small at all, and not disgustingly huge. I'd like to call it the perfect size dog, and when you bite into it, there is much juice and flavor to go with it. I got mine with everything on it minus the pickle, and all the ingredients compliment each other, one not overpowering the other. It's great.
