A few months ago, the rating would have been 4 stars, but something has changed at Chicago Diner. It's now 5 stars! I ate there last week and the food has taken a step up! It's great because vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free dining options are hard to come by in this town and Chicago Diner was really my only option. Their service is always friendly and efficient. They have a great gluten-free menu that's really tasty. Great salads, sweet potato fries, soft tacos with quinoa, rice and beans, and delicious raw cheesecake for dessert. I'll be visiting them again soon!
