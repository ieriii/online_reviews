FOOD: Best vegan shake in Chicago -- trust me, I've had them all. (It's also, unfortunately, probably the most expensive.) Great and varied vegan menu, though I'd say the brunch dishes are generally better than the dinner. The appetizers are usually disappointing, but the desserts more than make up for it. SERVICE: I've eaten at the Diner 10+ times, and the service can be hit-or-miss. Sometimes you'll get a mellow Bohemian who just can't quite pull it together enough to be a good server, though this was much more common a few years ago. Their hours are sometimes equally "relaxed" -- many times we've arrived later in the evening and they've decided to close early. Another reason to opt for brunch, I suppose. ATMOSPHERE: Comfy, but be warned that it can be cramped and loud at peak times. Patio's nice enough. The bathrooms are VERY poorly situated -- the doors open right into a very cramped hallway where the waiters are running back and forth. Admittedly not something that's easily fixed, but that won't stop me from bitchin' about it! FINAL WORD: It's got a parking lot. That's worth a star or two right there.
