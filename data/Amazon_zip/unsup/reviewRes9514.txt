My wife and I went for 'date nite' on Wednesday. We both got the special, Spring Rolls w/ duck for App, Salmon w/ a great, yummy, sauce for Main, and sorbet, raspberry & coconut for Desert. Service was great, water glass was never half empty! Which is a sign of them paying attention!!! Very nice spot in Gold Coast! The special with two glasses of wine cost of $60! Great price for the quality of food we received!
