Stopped by The Purple Pig for dinner while in town for a concert. Since my stomach eats on Eastern time zone, I arrived before the big dinner rush and was able to get seated quickly. We ordered 5 items from the menu per the server's friendly suggestion. My first complaint was that the menu descriptions do not adequately prepare you for what they are serving. I was frequently surprised by what I received versus the description and even more surprised to see what the other people at the communal table were receiving based on the menu descriptions. If you are going to have an exotic menu, I think you need to give patrons adequate tools to make their choices. My main concern, however, is that while the menu promises exotic eats, the dishes that are served are generally mediocre. The $20-something beef tenderloin was just okay, nothing special. The prosciutto balls (where's the prosciutto, by the way?) were bland. The panini was just a fancy ham and cheese. The saving grace for TPP is the pricing. I thought the pricing was excellent and a good value for the location. Overall, we had a fine meal and felt like we got our money's worth. But the quality of the food was very disappointing based on the hype.
