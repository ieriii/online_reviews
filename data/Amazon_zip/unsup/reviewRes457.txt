THE EXPERIENCE OF A LIFETIME! ...and worth every penny!!! Ignore any review that says it isn't. Everyone should eat here at least once. Grant Achatz is a genius and experiencing his art first hand is something you can't truly appreciate until you've dined here. Every course will surprise and delight you and the wine pairings enhance each course to a level of perfection that is beyond compare. Of course the service is outstanding, but that is not why you come, you come for the meal of a lifetime. The ultimate highlight is that Grant himself comes out and prepares the final course on your table. If you really appreciate delicious food and watching a truly passionate artist at work, you'll be brought to tears. Bravo Grant!
