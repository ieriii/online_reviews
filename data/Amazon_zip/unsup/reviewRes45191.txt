Surprised to see so many good reviews here. My experience with Anteprima was one of the worst I've had in Chicago in a while.  Poor service, poor management, poor food, poor interior. Not much to like about this place. We were there on a busy, but not packed Saturday night. It was so loud we couldn't talk across our table.  Our server agreed and claimed it was unusual. I don't see how that could be because the interior is stark and not well designed. We inquired about moving to the patio, and after checking ourselves to see it was 1/2 empty, the manager quickly ran over and said there were no open tables on the patio. After this our server knew we didn't want to be there, and treated us as such. Food. Meh. Mostly over cooked mush and confused dishes soaked in olive oil that I wouldn't exactly consider Italian. Like others mentioned, the goat cheese ravioli is good, but come on, it's goat cheese. The bacon wrapped monk fish was rubbery, despite the bacon. We were also put off that the Mezze (and bread) was sitting out uncovered in the main hallway were people are walking by. I get the "home-style" concept, but don't think it is appropriate for this setting. At least put it in the back of the prep kitchen (open to the dining room) where it can be seen but not dripped on by passers by headed back from the bathroom. Wine list seems like it was borrowed from a fancier restaurant.  I seem to recall maybe 2 bottles under $30? And no house wine carafe? Not what you'd expect at a "home-style" themed restaurant. Again, see above - "confused". Our server wasn't very helpful with the wine either - but this was after the table incident, so who knows. After leaving I was convinced this place would not make it. But I see here it has a loyal following. Maybe its the connection to Andersonville? Maybe cause it's new and different? Not sure, and not willing to try it again. Much better Italian restaurants in the area.
