I think 3-3.5 star places are average on Yelp and 4 tends to be exceptional. This place just isn't exceptional. To their credit, I came here for a charity function where they donated money per beer bought. Very nice. The area they put us in was quite small, but I think the response was more than expected. However, the service did not adapt! We had one (and maybe a half) waitresses getting beer and pizza for about 50 people at it's height. It wasn't adequate. And when you are thin on service like this something is bound to go wrong. In our case, our pizza was sat out in the middle of the area for the entire crowd to devour instead of to our individual table. Insult to injury- it wasn't that good! The crust was soggy and ingredients nothing special. I also found the Black Beer to only be ok. None of the other patrons were particularly impressed with their Heffeweise and other beers as well. It's too bad, I was looking forward to trying Piece. Glad everyone else is loving it though! It's in a fun little neighborhood where you can find something fun to do afterwards and parking was ok on a weeknight early on. Toward 8 people were turned away from even the valet though.
