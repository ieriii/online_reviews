What can I say, I love Artopolis. It has always been my favorite restaurant and have been going here for about 12 years now since undergrad days. Artopolis is a very laid back euro cafe and ideal for all occasions, dates, catch up with friends, one on one meetings, etc. The staff is extremely friendly albeit not too timely, typical of European restaurants. The decor is nice and open with windows facing Greek town. Their desserts and pomes frittes are perfect and have very good nescafe. This place is a hidden gem.
