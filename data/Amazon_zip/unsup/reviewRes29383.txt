We ordered take out from Opart tonight based on my happy memory of a previous dine-in experience. My husband and I split an order of the Masaman curry with chicken, a cucumber salad, and an order of crab rangoon.  The crab rangoon are great and the sauce that comes with them is really perfect - sweet but fresh and spicy, too.  The cucumber salad comes with jalapenos and is a little spicy if you happen to eat the seeds, but otherwise it's very yummy too.  The Masaman curry was the perfect size for the two of us and was delicious! We ordered two servings of sticky rice to accompany it, but I wasn't really a fan - probably should have gotten plain jasmine rice instead.  The portions aren't enormous, but they are totally an appropriate amount of food and the prices are good.
