My boyfriend and I enjoyed one of the best meals that we ever had. This restaurant is very good and nothing bad can be said about the atmosphere or the staff. We ordered the four course meal for $21.95 that is offered on Mondays.It is just a great price for the amount of food and definitely worth every penny.
