Get here by 10:30am and you won't end up waiting too long. I had the red eye benedict, which contains two perfectly poached eggs on top of andouille hash and english muffins. There was also a side of GRITS. And I had an endless cup of coffee. The eggs were runny and golden and the hash wasn't too greasy. Grits were good, especially doused with hot sauce. Not an everyday brunch food, but a real treat. Maybe it was also brunching with some old friends I haven't seen in five or ten years yet talking as if we had just seen each other last Friday, but I really like Wishbone.
