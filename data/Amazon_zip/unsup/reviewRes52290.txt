I had two things I had to eat while on vacation. 1) a bratwurst witch i didn't get to and 2) Deep Dish Pizza. I had been here before a year ago and loved it. But I would not have remembered how to get back to it unless we spotted it from our hotel window. This time we went in a bit late and had to wait an hour for the pizza, during this time my little brother in law and I were writing on the walls (they let you). We only had peperoni as a topping but when if finally came out it was damn good. Just as I remembered. The thick deep dish crust is so good and filling. My only complaint was the time we had to wait and our cracked out server. He was nuts. Over all, I cant wait to go back.
