I was in town for a conference and had limited time for breakfast or brunch. Since we were staying at the Hilton this was a short walk from the hotel. We were a party of 5 and were quickly seated. Our waiter was a bit overwhelmed, he couldn't seem to keep up with his tables. We had an accident at our table - water spilled and it took him 15 minutes to keep napkins to clean up the water. We tried to do it ourselves, but the bathrooms had no paper towels. When the waiter finally returned, we had moved away from the table as to not get soaked from the water. Then, the waiter cleaned the floor first. We just didn't understand this thinking.Fast forward, my food was great. I ordered the shrimp benedict because it was a twist on an old classic. Yum! The other members of my party were satisfied with the meals as well. My only negative comment about the food was they put everything on one plate..including the fruit next to the hot potatoes & hollandaise sauce. Needless to say, I didn't eat the fruit although I would have loved to on such a hot day in the city. I enjoyed the meal, but the service was not great. I'd return to give it another try.
