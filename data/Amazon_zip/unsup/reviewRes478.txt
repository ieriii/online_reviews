I don't remember much because it's been nearly 2 years but all I have to say is that it is GORGEOUS and so delicious. I had a bug in my salad, but I was given a new one immediately and the wait staff was very apologetic. These things happen. And it was a salad. It was fine to me. There was one dish that will never be forgotten. I honestly don't know what it was. It was a dessert and I honestly don't know how to describe it. It looked like it was on some kind of cone and it was definitely brown... cinnamon? I don't know. But we were told to eat it all in one bite and it was the most incredible thing on earth.
