The Pros: Huge tasty burritos, good quesedillas, and nice yummy tacos. Margaritas are pretty good, and order a pitcher to get one of the best deals in the city. Location is good and the hours are quite convenient if you need a late night snack after adventures in Lincoln Square. The Cons: Service is so-so. While they have good basic mexican fare, if you stray too far from the tacos and burritos the food gets less impressive. The shrimps in my "camarones al mojo de ajo" were a little stringy, and they just dumped a pile of chopped raw garlic on top of them. Refried beans are surprisingly bland. Essentially: if you find yourself in Lincoln Square craving a ginormous burrito and some price effective booze to wash it down with, Garcia's is just fine. Otherwise, its not really a destination spot.
