This is the only place where I have wanted to pay to leave with 6 courses remaining. And others at my table wanted to leave before that! It is all flash and little substance. If gimmicks, pomp and salty, fatty, goop is what you want, you will get plenty of it at Alinea, unfortunately, you won't get much else.
