I love Sabatino's! It's a pleasure to dine at this wonderful establishment as the owners and staff treat their customers with high regard. Every meal I've ever eaten here has always been delicious and reasonably priced for the amount of food that is served. I've been a regular for at least twenty years; if you're searching for a restaurant with yummy food at a fair price, great people watching, and amazing treatment Sabatino's is the place!
