This place has been the best I've ever been to. It's OMG good. The soup of the day was cream of mushroom with chicken, it was awesome. My friend recommended this place and we paid for her food because she did good by taking us there. I had the Asian salad, it was the best salad I've ever had.  You'll see all walks of life in that place from beach goers to people who seem to be on a romantic date. Totally recommend this place for any type of outing, casual or a bit more upscale. I will definitely will be going back. The only down side was the valet was full and we had to self park, which wasn't so bad because parking was a half block away. Oh and your gonna wait, it get's packed the later it gets.
