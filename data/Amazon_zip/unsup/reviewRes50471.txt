Good, not great, food, but the service is what put this over the 3 star rating for me. Both the owner and the waitress who served us were incredibly kind and really interested in hearing what we thought about the meal. The appetizers (blue crab cheesecake, crawfish fritters, and fried green tomatoe) and red velvet cake dessert were PHENOMENAL. But the entreese were nothing special. I did the oyster stew special-- the sauce and grilled frisee were great, but the oysters themselves were just meh. The crawfish etouffee was fine and the braised pork shank was HUGE but underseasoned. All of the cocktails and coffee drinks were nice though. I think this is going to be a place that we keep heading back to, but next time, we'll make it small plates of appetizers and cocktails instead of doing entrees.
