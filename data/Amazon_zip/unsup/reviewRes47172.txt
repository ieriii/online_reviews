Came here for 1/2 priced burger Tuesday. We had a group of 8 people or so and the staff was able to manage us fairly well considering it was Tuesday and they are incredibly busy that day. I had the turkey burger, which was cranberry confit, stuffing, brie on pretzel bun. The turkey burger was nicely seasoned and flavorful. The burger was pretty intense, bring your a-game. I think I came here another time before a show at the Empty Bottle and had some wings. They were pretty solid from what I can remember. The beer list is pretty good and fairly priced. Obviously, this place is a complete rip off of Kuma's and although actual decor and atmosphere doesn't quite live up to Kuma's, the food certainly does. In fact the food here is better than Kuma's.
