Have had great experiences there.  Really like the prime rib. have actually liked it better than the "top" steak houses in town (no, gibson's is NOT one. if you think so, try ponderosa. won't cost as much) friendly experience. lots of tourists, tho. like the art deco decor. they make a good martini, too :) real martinis, not sweet crap served in a martini glass :) apparently, the desserts are also very good. I'm a steak and veggies guy, so it was excellent!
