I don't have much Cuban food experience but several people have attested that it is authentic.  Tips: - Not much indoor seating space. Just a counter really. No place to lounge around. - Cuban espresso doesn't mess around. It is really strong. - All the different types of Yuca are fantastic. - Their house hot sauce is a personal favorite.
