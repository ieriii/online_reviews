Thanks to some new friends, I had my first pho-dventure last night. Good things come to those who wait, me thinks. It was great - warm, soothing, spicy (might have something to do with the siracha I so generously squirted in) and beefy. Mmm. I can see why it's so highly addicting. I had a pretty innocuous variety with the standard sliced meat and a couple of extra little meatballs. I'd probably stick to the same thing next time, maybe bypassing the meatballs depending on my mood. Also, my friend and I split the banana sweetie cake that was doused in coconut milk and crushed peanuts. I'd highly recommend it.
