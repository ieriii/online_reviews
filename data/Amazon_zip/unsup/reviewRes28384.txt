I have been to Nueva Leon many a times in the past few years, and always thought of it as one of my favorite Mexican places in the city. However, the last time I went I was pretty disappointed in the food and left hoping this was just an off night rather than a new trend. To begin, our salsa (normally delicious here) was just not good. Not good. I couldn't even eat it--I'm not sure if it was out of a can or just old, but either way it was pretty unappetizing, especially with our cold stale chips (it was Friday night--no excuse for that). Our entrees--fajitas for me and huevos rancheros for him-- were mediocre at best, definitely not what I expected from Nueva Leon. And our waitress, though friendly, was so busy we had to wave her down every time we needed something.  If this was my first visit to Nueva Leon, I would have given it one star, but I am hoping that they were just having an off night and the next time I go (and there will be at least one more time) it will live up to my memories.
