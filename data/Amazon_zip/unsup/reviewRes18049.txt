Xoco is kind of like a slightly more upscale, Mexican version of Panera Bread. The service was a little weird - you order in line, they give you a "table" (we were seated at small counter) number, and then a server brings your food, clears your table, and asks you if you want dessert. The person who gave us our number while we waited in line changed our number a few times and then couldn't remember what number she gave us. This system just didn't really seem to work or to be efficient. Additionally, I got a glass for water and it was self-serve...no big deal, but the water and seltzer weren't clearly marked and I got seltzer by accident - ew! The food was okay - the sandwiches were small and overpriced. They also didn't come with chips or any sides. Taste-wise, they were good, but not worth the price. We did not get churros, but they looked awesome. I would go back just to get a churro...
