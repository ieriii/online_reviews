I really like that their miso soup has jalapenos in it. Give it a nice kick. I'm not a fan of sitting out on the patio but it's nice that they have it. The sushi selections are really good and the environment is pretty cool. Service is quick and if you don't like waiting too long, sitting at the bar is just as good and the guys behind the sushi bar are cool and nice to talk to. I'm looking forward to going back.
