So one time I came here for a friend's birthday. It was late, we were a party of over 16 and I don't think anyone had made a reservation. But they were very nice and accommodating and put together a giant, long, medieval King Arthur-style feast table for us as quickly as possible. We ordered sangria for the group and I added a side of Carnivale Margarita. Here's how the evening went: 8:00pm: "This cocktail is so good. The sangria is so good. This guacamole is amazing!" 8:30pm: "Thish cocktail is so good. The sangria is so good. The remolachas are amazing!" 9:00pm: "Thish cocktail is sho good. The shangria ees sho good. The churrasco is to die for!" 9:30pm: "Theesh cocktail is shooo.....Eh......Forgot what I was going to say. I love the pernil. Pass me the rice, please." As you can see, the food is so incredibly delicious you'll remember it even if the alcohol, colorful decor and salsa music make you forget everything else.
