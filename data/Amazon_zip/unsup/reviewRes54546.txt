I am very disappointed at what I've seen from this restaurant. As I filled my plate from their salad bar, I noticed that most of the products at the salad bar are canned and not fresh. And since when were salads weighed to get the price??? The price of food should be based on quality, not on how heavy it is. I asked for some tahina sauce and they said it only comes on the Jerusalem salad. Another disappointment was the meat. It was dull and tasteless and I hope in the future the food will taste better. Try to change the quality of your food and try to smile for once as you accept your customers. I'm sure your not going to see me again. Hope to see some good changes.
