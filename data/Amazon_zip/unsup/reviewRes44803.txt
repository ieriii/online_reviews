Giordano's is good. For stuffed-style pizza's it's one of the better places to go. Actually, I recently tried their thin crust pizza which was also good. Overall, I can't complain, although it doesn't blow me away in either category. I hate it when people confused stuffed pizzas with Chicago deep dish. Oh well... such is ignorance.
