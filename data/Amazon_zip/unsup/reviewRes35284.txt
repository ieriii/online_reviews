My friend found this place through her endless foodie research.  We didn't have reservations and we walked in on Sunday and waited about 30 minutes for a party of 3.  We were a bit confused on the ordering, but we had to get the Peking Duck! It came with soup, (6) buns, fried rice, and a couple of garnishes (green onion, carrots, and pickled cucumbers). We also opted for the chinese broccoli. It was all very tasty. The duck was served and cut table side. The fried rice wasn't that great. The duck was pretty juicy. With a large beer, it all came out to $58 without tip. I thought it was the perfect amount of food for 3.  Considering the food was good/average, I wouldn't necessarily make the drive to the Uptown area from downtown, just to eat here. Apparently, others might since the place was crowded & with a quite a wait. Keep in mind I live in San Francisco where good Chinese food is plentiful and reasonable.
