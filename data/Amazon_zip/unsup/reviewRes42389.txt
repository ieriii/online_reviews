If I don't get to Tank at least 2-3 times a month, my vietnamese cravings go un-satisfied. I'll make the treck up lake shore drive for this cheap, delicious treat. I tried finding substitutes around streeterville where I live but the "pho" at big bowl, Le colonial, and Quang noodle just can't live up to the authentic Tank version. It just tastes like it's been simmering for hours and the spices are balanced just right. The portions are ginormous (it's an official word now) and everything on the menu is great. I like to stick to my favorites - the beef pho, the spring roll appetizer (the one you can make yourself with the beef and shrimp), the squid lemongrass stir fry, the crispy noodle dish with chicken, and the various meats over vermicelli noodles. The bubble tea is a nice plus if you are particularly famished or if it is hot outside. Yes, I've been to the Zagat rated fancy restaurant down the street, and no, it was not worth the pretty decor, hefty price, and snotty service. Tank is definitely not a first date place unless your date appreciates no romance whatsoever. But it's a great place to go if you are broke, appreciate authentic vietnamese food, or if you have a big group of people who are really hungry.
