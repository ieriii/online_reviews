I've wanted to eat here since I saw his show on PBS. I was really worried it wouldn't be as good as I hoped - and I was not disappointed. I had guacamole, trio of ceviche and the Topolobampo margarita which were all wonderful. I was able to try the food from the people with me: goat enchiladas with mole, brisket and roasted pork and pineapple tacos which were absolutely tasty. I can't wait to go again! Another cool thing about the place is that Rick Bayless is actually there all the time!
