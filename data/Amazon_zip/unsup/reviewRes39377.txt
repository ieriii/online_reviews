I was a bit unsure about what to expect of this place given the location and the low-profile decor they have. It's a very laid back atmosphere, a long wait, and food that's totally worth waiting for. That little kitchen can turn around some amazing stuff! Our waiter was knowledgeable, had good suggestions, and spaced out the food perfectly. A friend and I split 6 small dishes ( which is about half of their small dish menu. And yes, they were smaaaaall) and 3 full desserts. The desserts were full sized, in case you were wondering. Every thing we had. I mean, EVERYTHING was really good. The osso bucco was amazing, as were the scallops. And we finished all three desserts. My favorite was the almond cake thing. Can I say, AMAZING? Will def. be going back.
