Finally! I've heard the praises about this place, but since you have to get up early to avoid the lines, I hadn't been there yet. Last Sunday we both woke up early thinking about Bongo Room. It was time. We got there a few minutes before they opened so we wandered around the neighborhood. By the time we got back, there was a line 20 people deep. One sign of a quality place is the attentiveness of the wait staff. We were approached as soon as we sat down and our needs were met throughout the meal. I ordered the Tenderloin Eggs Benedict. The sauce was richer than any Hollandaise sauce I've ever tasted. Very buttery and very good. :) The roasted potatoes which accompanied the Benedict might have been a bit better if they were ordered crispy. Side of Bacon had a very unusual smoky flavoring. Delicious. If Yelp had 1/2 star ratings the Bongo Room would get a 4.5.
