While I was a little hesitant when we were invited here for Restaurant week we chose to go anyway. The reservation time was early so I didn't think we would have to many issues. Arrived on time for our reservation and we were seated promptly.  The nice thing was that even though it was RW their entire menu was available. I chose to go with the pre fix which was a fresh salad which I thought was very good, a filet which was cooked perfectly and a trio of desserts. I am not a huge dessert person so i didn't mind that they were my least favorite part of the meal. $44 for the entire meal I thought was reasonable. I thought their service and offering were on par with what you would find at other steakhouses in Chicago. Our server was very nice and answered our questions and even provided some wine recommendations that would not "break the bank". While I rarely venture into this area to eat I would recommend RC to someone that is looking for a nice meal with friendly service.
