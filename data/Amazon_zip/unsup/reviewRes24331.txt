Finally went here after hearing good things and I am very glad I did. We got the La Mesa de Jose tasting menu. It was awesome. The tomato bread they start you out with is very good. The tasting menu included bacon wrapped dates, shrimp, octopus and cured meat among other things. There was a romesco sauce that was very tasty as a garnish for a few of the meats. We also had the seasonal sangria which was delicious. The restaurant has a nice set up and great location. I would recommend this place for anyone who likes Spanish food.
