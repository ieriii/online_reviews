This place is a playground for meat lovers! That being said, I don't really eat meat (only chicken and seafood) and still had a decent time. Service was wonderful but that may have had something to do with the fact we were only ones there for an early 5:15pm dinner and enjoyed individualized attention. Gauchos came around very often- every minute or so and even asked me what I liked so they could bring it out and saw me trying to take a photo and pulled down the blinds to reduce the glare without me even asking. Salad bar is like an upscale, mini Old Country Buffet or a mini Bellagio Las Vegas buffet- includes lasagna, manicotti, risotto, tortellini, sushi, chicken salad, artichoke hearts, oysters, and many other salads. Grilled pineapple from the gauchos is not to be missed, bacon-wrapped chicken breast is full of flavor, and side of fried bananas are sweet and satisfying. Come very hungry as you will be absolutely stuffed by the end of this meal- by the end, it's work to get down the last few rounds of meat. But as it's all-you-can-eat, how can you resist?
