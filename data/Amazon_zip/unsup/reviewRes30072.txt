I've lived by the Chicago Diner for almost two years and it wasn't until now that I finally gave it a go. I have been missing out! I've tried their Reuben and their newest B.L.Titanic Burger. The Reuben was one of the best i've ever had, as a meat eater I was surprised by the savory and spicy flavor. The BLTitanic burger was also great, it was a veggie-seitan burger with a housemade chipotle mayo, crispy onions and a wheat bun. For dessert I got the carrot cake with crushed almonds and coffee. Let's just say, that by the time I was ready to leave I was practically in a food coma-a very good food coma. The service was quick and attentive and everyone inside had on big smiles :)
