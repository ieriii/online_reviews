If you like thin crust or trying different sauces, this is the pizza for you!!! My friend got me addicted to this place. They have delicious thin crust pizza and when they say large, they mean large!! My 2 male friends (who eat a lot) and I could not finish this pizza last time we went there. The beers were pretty good as well. The only reason I didn't give this place a 5 is because the time we went it was too loud and crowded, street parking is quite difficult, and the waitress was a bit slow. But I think the delicious pizza is worth it.
