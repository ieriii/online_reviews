I've never been disappointed here. I bought a chocolate cheesecake a couple of weeks ago for my sister's birthday. It was heavenly. It was rich. Definitely didn't taste like those refrigerated cream cheese types. The consistency was more like a very dense mousse. My sister is a cheesecake connoisseur and she LOVED it. I tend to buy cupcakes here and they are always moist and fresh. I love the options in flavors and also, they look more like 'mini cakes' instead of the typical muffin (although they also have those). My favorite thing to get here (next to their olive baguette - soooo fresh!) are the cookies. They are fresh and delicious sugar cookies with stuff like "you suck" or "loser" written in frosting on them. I get them for my co-workers sometimes. They recently had some halloween cookies, and once even a Stewie Griffin (from Family Guy) cookie!  They have a place to sit and relax next door, and in the summer, you can sit @ their sidewalk patio and watch yuppies walk their dogs who take craps right in front of you. By the way, they sell doggie treats in the shape of bones. I kinda want to try one :-o The staff is nice. Prices are reasonable. Their eggplant sandwich is one of my favorites. It's big and has hummus too. I'm not crazy about their other sandwiches, but their quiche looks quite good.
