Tied as my favorite brunch spot in the city, and maybe even ever. I almost always get the same thing, but if it ain't broke, don't fix it. Their benedict is divine, coffee is good, love their cheese grits and the crunchy french toast is AWESOME. Go every week and will continue to do so until I move out of Chicago!
