I love this place. Sexy atmosphere. Great food. Fantastic staff. I had a special occasion with a lady-friend of mine here about two years ago and gave them like a butt-load of details and specifications for what I wanted and they delivered on everything, including dressing their Spanish guitarist in a Panda bear suit! No, just kidding. But for realz, this place will bend over backwards for their customers. A+'s across the board for Geja's. By the way, that lady-friend is now my wife. Geja's worked for me, it can work for you.
