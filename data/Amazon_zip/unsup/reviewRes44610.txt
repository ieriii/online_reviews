I prefer Chicago's deep dished pizza over New York's thin crust pizza any day, and Giordano's is the place where I get this sort of pizza every time I come to Chicago - the wait in line is approx. 30 minutes. I've tried Lou Malnati's, and the sauce is too tangy. Giordano's is sweeter and a lot cheesier (I recommend adding fresh garlic on top. It tastes amazing). I love how the sauce is on top of the condiments so that the cheese doesn't harden. It remains gooey throughout the entire duration of the meal. Now, if they were to combine Lou Malnati's buttery, flaky crust with Giordano's sauce and toppings, that would be heavenly. I could eat a whole medium sized pie of that since I definitely don't think I can handle the large.
