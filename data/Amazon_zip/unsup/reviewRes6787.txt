The excellent food started with the complimentary bread & butter pickles and BBQ chips. These starters and all of the food that followed was excellent. The prices were surprisingly reasonable. To go along with the tasty BBQ, they have a diverse draft list of high quality craft beers. Our waiter was friendly and attentive without being intrusive. One of our meals was accompanied by the wrong side dish, but the correct side was promptly brought out. The only drawback is the noise level in the dining room. Next time I'm back in Chicago, I'll be going here again.
