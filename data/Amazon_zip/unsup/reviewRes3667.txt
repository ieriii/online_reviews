Some yelpers and I checked this place out prior to the Suri Thai Elite event. Prior to getting there the menu on their website was intimidating me, once I got these I was still intimidated, a bit less. The room is simple. Community seating. The staff member running the counter was WAY helpful in helping me make my selection. I went with the Seoul Sassy Wings. - A subtly sweet sauce prepared with ginger, soy, garlic and other select spices make this a crowd favorite. Regarding the wings- you do not need to order 10, 5 is more than enough. Especially if you're a group and everyone is sharing. These wings are H-U-G-E. Like Taste of Chicago huge. Learn from our mistake, three of us ordered 10 piece each and there was plenty left over. Also, it's messy, really messy and there are paper towels on the table. You'll need them. Fries were blah. I will try the Smashed Potatoes next time.
