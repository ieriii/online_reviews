90 Miles is a wonderful addition to the neighborhood. We used to go to the Clybourn location and were pumped to see another restaurant opened. The owner(s) are very genuine people and are usually on-site making sure customers are satisfied and enjoying the experience. The food is flavorful and portion sizes are good for the price. Whether you eat at the outdoor patio or inside it is always a wonderful experience. We've been there many times already and will continue to go....Yum!!
