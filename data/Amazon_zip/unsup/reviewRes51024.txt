My boyfriend and I woke up on A saturday morning...and he had a mean biscuits and gravy craving. SOO we checked out wishbone (i love that hood)! he ordered a half order of biscuits and gravy which is basically a bowl of gravy with one biscuit in it. He REALLY enjoyed it. I got the light spinach omelette with the corn muffin on the side. the corn muffin was FRESH FRESH FRESH and the omelette was sizeable and delish, i could only finish half. It also came with potatoes on the side! overall a good experience, totally a place to bring your parents when they're in town!!!
