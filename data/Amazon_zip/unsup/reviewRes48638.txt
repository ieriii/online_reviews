The brunch I had here trumped the dinner. I think it may very well be impossible to top a pork-belly-polenta-cake though. All in all, I enjoyed both visits, and will go back for brunch at some point, but I am not so excited to revisit it for dinner. The best dinner item I had was the pork belly, which was very good. The beer selection is great. Some of the beers I am possibly too familiar with were on the menu and in my judgement, overpriced. I think the tab on a Rochefort 10 was $15. At Binny's it'll cost you $6 or $7... Anyway, I really did love the brunch and The Publican allows for a reason to drink a beer early in the day.
