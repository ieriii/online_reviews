Overpriced drinks, yes, and that is why the review is missing one star. However, it remains one of the only standard places to come and hear jazz in the city, and it has an ambiance you can't beat. As I said in my Double Door review, at least come in to have your picture taken by the bar while you pretend you are John Cusack. "Did I say and do those things? Yes." I also, uh, hear there are tap dancers there sometimes.
