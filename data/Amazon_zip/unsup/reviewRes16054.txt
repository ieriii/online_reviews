I heard about Calo from a good friend of the owner so we chose to go here for a late night business/dinner meeting! It has a very nice ambiance, just a very classy look so I was excited to check it out as soon as I got there. We didn't know what to get so my friend told the owner to just pick some stuff out for us. We shared two appetizers of Rotolo di mozzarella, and fried calamari. We then slip an entree of Rotolo di Melanzana which is Eggplant rolled and stuffed with ricotta cheese, garlic and pargmigiana cheese. It's ten covered in mozzarella cheese and placed in a yummy marinara sauce. I've never had eggplant so I was excited to broaden my tastebuds and I'm SO glad I did. It was one of the best meals I've had!! The owner then insisted we have some tiramisu...who can say no to that haha!! Every aspect of the meal was amazing!! This is the best business meeting I've ever had both food and productivity wise haha! I'll definitely be giving Calo a lot of business!!
