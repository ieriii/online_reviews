Ok this place is FUN. It is a FUN atmosphere, with FUN drinks, and FUN food! Fun is really the only word I can think of. I have been there twice in my lifetime..first time I had the skirt steak which was awesome..SOOOOOOO flavorful. And on the side had some paella, which was ALSO sooooooo good, but I was SOOOOOOOOoo stuffed I couldn't eat that much. It was for a work gathering, and Carnivale was able to accomodate us pretty nicely in our own private room! I went there again last week and my childhood friend is actually a server there, so we had awesome service too! Tons of great specials with GOAT CHEESE, which I'm obsessed with..so I loved everything. We got these plantains with meat on them for an appetizer and chunky guac..both were excellent. I had a couple of stale chips, but who cares when I can feel the texture of the avocados and taste the FRESH lime juice that goes into the guac! The plantains were ALSO amazing!! For dinner, I had this brazed pork of sorts...it was a-ma-zing. Seriously. The meat just fell apart and was so tender. It was so flavorful. There were also hot peppers in it, which I only tasted SOMETIMES with the bites with the peppers..How they didn't get the entire dish to taste like a gigantic jalepeno pepper, I don't know. There was fresh, firm, sweet corn in it too. I could just tell that this wasn't something that the chef cooked in the beginning of the night and served later.  The drinks ARE a bit weak. But that's my only complaint. So 1 star off for that. But the FOOD is SOO GOOD!!
