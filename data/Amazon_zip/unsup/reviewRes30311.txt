The last time I was here was 3 years ago and it was unbelievable that I had to come back with my visit to Chicago. We came here for lunch (after a solid hour wait), started off with the chicken tortilla soup which was way too salty and kind of bland which we were surprised by! It also had a ton of cheese in it...boo! For lunch had the duck tacos which came with tortillas that you made yourself, pinto beans, guacamole and 2 salsas. This really was fantastic, i loved that you made your own taco as i just ate everything separately! Also had the enchila, which was also loaded with cheese, but still tasty. Would recommend it to friends and would return again, as long as the wait wasn't too long.
