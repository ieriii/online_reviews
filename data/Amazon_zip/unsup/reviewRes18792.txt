Luved the churros! So delicious, but wasn't a huge fan of the chocalate dipping sauce. It didn't really go together for some reason. The line was long on a rainy Tuesday night. We waited about 45 minutes to order and another 15 for the food. The ahogada and pepito were pretty good. The pepito reminds me of a philly cheesesteak. The ahogada tasted a little like a mix between Mexican and Vietnamese broth. Interesing flavors, but I liked the freshness. The inside is quite small, so you have to share seating with others. The line was kind of confusing, but there was a hostess to explain the two different lines - one to dine and one to order to go. The ahogada is dine-in only, so if you want to try then you gotta wait. I guess if you're a tourist then you should wait and try for yourself. However, if you live or work nearby then its not worth the wait
