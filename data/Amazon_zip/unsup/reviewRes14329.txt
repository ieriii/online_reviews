Well, I watch the food network religiously and I saw Glenns Diner on Diners, Drive-in, and Dives and was really excited because it was near by. So a few friends and I made plans to go once I was out of work and we arrive and the guy at the door asked how many ppl and I told him three and he took some time to look at his sheet of paper and then told us there was a 20min wait, not to mention there were open tables. A 20 min wait when there are open tables? The guy said they were reserved but I wasn't aware that diners took reservations, not even downtown "restaurants" take reservations. I'm not a fish eater and I guess there was some fish special that lasted until 6pm and the 20 min wait would put it just after 6pm. So I'm not sure if they were just trying to avoid us ordering the special. Not to mention a group of 3 walked in RIGHT before us and were seated with no problem and its EXTREMELY small. I would not recommend this place at all. As far as I am concerned the food MIGHT be good but the service sucked.
