Had a late dinner here last weekend. There was a short wait, which is typical because it is a small-ish dining room. Can't wait until the weather is warmer, and the outdoor dining is available once again. If you're lucky enough to snag a booth, they are much better than the tables because the tables are so small & close together. I don't really like sitting elbow to elbow strangers, but the food here is worth it! We started with the Buffalo style seitan "wings." They were very tasty, especially with the vegan ranch dip sauce. I had the Reuben, which was HUGE & even better than I remembered on marble rye bread. The Daiya brand "cheese" they are now using is the best. Can't wait to go back again for this sandwich. I am not a fan of the Diner's vegan desserts. Their cakes always seem too dry to me, & their ice cream is not my favorite. We split the Snickerdoodle cookie and added cookie dough ice cream on top. It was all just way too sugary & lacking in flavor for me, but my friend was ok with it. Service can be hit or miss at times, but this last time was friendly & prompt. I'll be back for you, Reuben!
