Went with my wife in September for a "date night." We have been here a couple of times before either by ourselves or with friends when we lived in the area. We like is so much we make a decent trip to go out of our way to come back. The menu straddles the line between Mexican/Cuban with a couple more generic options thrown in for the person who might not be a fan of those styles. This visit was once again no exception. For the first time we got a seat on the patio instead of the dining room. Everything was very pleasant and the menu is the same as in the dining room. The only downside was that the tables and chairs out there are plastic, bordering on patio type furniture, which I'm sure is easier for the staff to put away and clean for outdoor seating but doesn't exactly scream high quality. My wife had a Mojito and I had a Caipirinha to start, which were both excellent. The service was prompt, but not pushy to take our orders for the appetizer and entrees. We shared their quesadillas which were excellent. My wife had their halibut and I had the roast pork. Both dishes we excellent and perfectly prepared. I ate every last thing on my plate and my wife came close. We finished it off with some chocolate cake which was good as well. The meal was well paced without things coming too quickly but we didn't feel like we were waiting around for anything at the same time. The final damage was in the $125 range for appetizer, entrees, dessert and three drinks each. Not bad.
