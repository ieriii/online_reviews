Heard a lot of hype about this place, but was not impressed. The beers are good, but pricey. The menu makes no sense at all. No nachos?!!...what's up with that? My wife and I had the bruschetta. Not bad, but not great either. Place was packed at 5pm on a Friday. We exited and went around the corner to the Logan Bar & Grill. We won't return to Revolution Brewing Co, but will definitely be back to the Logan.
