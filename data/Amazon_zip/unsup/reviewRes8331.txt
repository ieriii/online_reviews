We visited Fogo again this past weekend with two other couples. Once again, the service and the quality of the meats was just superb. Absolutely delicious. My one and only gripe, and its a teeny tiny gripe, is the fact that the mashed potatoes are instant. I don't really mind since I don't usually bother with them...I'm focused on the meats. Would be nice to see scratch made mashed potatoes though.
