I have dined here 6 times and rate it a solid and consistent 4.5 stars. This place is simple and amazing. Although the portions are small, the skill demonstrated in each dish make not getting more worth it. The mixed drinks are also very creative. Although the tasting menus are fun, I would stick with an entree format and enjoy fewer dishes in more depth. Great wine selection as well.
