You are so right Lauren. The owner is a total jerk. We had been at our table for about 30 minutes, when the jerk owner came by and told us he needed our table. What!! We were going to order dessert and coffee but we decided to pass. We lingered over our water for the next 15 minutes, while the owner fumed. We will not return.
