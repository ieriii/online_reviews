I love going to a place and not having to hassle anyone to get a meal without meat and loads of cheese. I had the grilled cheeze and a side of steamed broccoli. I was surprised- the 'cheeze' was better than real cheese, and the tomatoes and carrots made it the best sandwich I've ever had- by far. I tried a friend's spinach soup, and even though I'm not a fan of spinach, it was amazing. The side of broccoli was exactly that- a big stalk of fresh steamed broccoli, without butter or salt or anything other restaurants put on veggies. The waitstaff was great. They seemed to like their job and the food they were serving. I'm going to come back here as often as possible.
