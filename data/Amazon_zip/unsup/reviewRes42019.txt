This place should be earning 3 or 4 stars but the reason it is not is simply because the service is terrible. Now, I feel I must explain because the bartenders were great. My GF, again looking hot, ordered a Whiskey Sour and it tasted fantastic. I was going to order one, but in my distant memory I thought I read that this cocktail is kinda of a chick drink, so I went with an Old Fashioned...  Anyway, those servers behind the cool bar were nice. It was the guy with the trim beard (you know who you are) who waited on our table. What a douchebag! Now, I go out frequently both for business and pleasure, and it has been quite a while since I got this much attitude from a waiter. What was this guy thinking? Were we bothering him by sitting in his section? Did we really put him out asking him to describe the menu and what he recommended? Typical exchange: GF: "Can you describe how the pork belly is prepared?"                  Waiter: "Do you like bacon?"                  GF:" Uh yes, for breakfast"                  Waiter: "Then you'll like this" Of course, I cannot adequately convey the distain in his tone nor the smary look in his face, but you get the point... There are a ton a really good restaurants and cocktail establishments in the city to choose from. Restaurants liveand die by the repeat customer. My suggesstion to the owners of Gilt Bar is to sit down with your people and explain the benefits of being nice to customers. In the meantime, why go here?
