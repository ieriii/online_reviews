I spent $44 in cash on 7 hot dogs, 2 pops and a cheese fry after waiting 45 minutes in line freezing my ass off. Would I do it again? You bet I would. Happily. I can't say that about ANYTHING. My world for a foie gras hot dog right now. Wins: 1. Curry dog - that cranberry chutney cheese on top of the curry dog makes for an amazing delicious surprising bite 2. Smoked knockwurst - it has cheese inside of the dog, I am drooling thinking about it 3. Atomic Bomb - the perfect dog for those who love a little spice in their life 4. Portobello swiss - mushrooms were perfect, swiss amazing sharpness 5. Creole spicy sausage - totally different kind of dog, more sausage like, very spicy with some amazing cheese sprinkled on top 6. Fries - total perfection, twice fried, perfectly salted -- amazing with cheese. SUPER wins (there are no fails at Hot Doug's): 1. Foie gras dog - I will need to get one every visit. Duck sausage with truffle and foie gras on top? Can something get more amazing? No. I want to eat this now. I want to die eating this. I want nothing more than this right now. 2. Duck confit dog - pork sausage with duck confit, a bit sweet, but completely perfect. 3. They have Diet Dr. Brown's Black Cherry -- the best diet soda to ever exist period. Doug -- you are a genius. Please send a foie gras dog to Detroit, kthnxbai. Officially on my Must Visit list for when I come to Sweet Home Chicago.
