I went here for lunch on opening day... Today! I'm always down for trying new places and you can't get much newer then XOCO at the moment. Since it was opening day I was expecting a line, but I was shocked to see that it wasn't as long as I thought it would be. Sadly they had a sign that said there was no carry out today. I really didn't want to eat there with all the Rick Bayless fan boys. But I really had no other option. I ended up waiting in line for about 20 minutes before I placed an order. The menu isn't that large, maybe 10 different sandwiches. After going back and forth on a couple different options I ordered the Cubana and a chocolate espresso. These two items set me back $15. I thought XOCO was the cheaper of the three Rick Bayless restaurants! It took a really long time for my Cubana to finally show up at my seat. Bayless and his team need to speed things up here, I'm sure this being opening day had a lot to do with that. I could have had free chips at Frontera and waited just as long. The taste did make up for the long wait. The sandwich rocked but a sandwich with bacon and avocado is usually going to be a good sandwich.  I'd go back again but I'm not going to eat there and put up with the wait. Hopefully over the next few weeks they speed things up.
