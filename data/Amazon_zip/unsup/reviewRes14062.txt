All you can eat crab legs on Tuesdays!!!!! Did I mention this includes all you can eat corn on the cob and cole slaw? I thought the cole slaw was really good and the corn on the cob came with parmesan on top! The legs were ridiculous. They were huge and hot!!! I ate the most at my table, we even made a tally sheet out of one of our place mats. Service was great! Very attentive without the annoyance! I also really liked the cereal zodiac painting that was above our table. The girl in the painting looks like Bjork. Go check it out. Might have to go back tonight for all you can eat ribs! mmmm all you can eat (drool)... P.S. the price was really reasonable (drool)
