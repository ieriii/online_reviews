Frickin' AWESOME!! You have to get the carne asada (steak)!!!! The original tacos are great...just meat, cilantro, and onions. But what's even better is the steak burrito. I got mine with all of the extra fixins (cheese, sour cream, guac, lettuce, tomatoes, and rice). The secret is simple...they take pride in the quality and freshness of their food. I saw the cooks carefully cutting up the steak and hand seasoning it to perfection. This place was featured on Check, Please!, and was what made me originally come here. But, now that the food speaks so loudly, it will call my name quite frequently. One last suggestion...there are 3, count'm, 3 La Pasadita's on the same block!!! I have been to two of them, and I must say, go to the restaurant one at 1132 N. Ashland at all costs!!!! For my last visit, I went to the one just north of 1132, and they had less than half the menu and no extra ingredients (how hard is it to stock lettuce, sour cream, tomatoes, etc?). Plus, the place was filthy and had a table filled with salsa containers without lids on them....gross. It reminded me of a Nickelodeon Double Dare stunt.
