I am a gluten-free diner, and they went out of their way to make sure I knew what I could and couldn't eat (even offered to fetch spinach from the kitchen that didn't have crouton crumbs in it - if you have celiac, you'll know about cross-contamination). 90% of their food was gluten free - yay! The service was impeccable, the meat and salad bar delicious, and the house drink with the dark rum and the papaya cream dessert were out of this world.
