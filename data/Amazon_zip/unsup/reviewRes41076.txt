Overview: If I could give it a 4.5 stars, I would, because that's how close this restaurant was to being perfect! Food: 8 courses of heaven! Each dish was more delightful than the last! Started with some weird rabbit concoction that was very flavorful and didn't have the gamey taste that rabbit sometimes has ... then had a truffle soup, which was amazing. The highlight of the meal was the scallop - it was like a party in my mouth. It was so rich! I loved every plate I was served, and that's pretty good, considering they had 8 chances :)  Ambiance: The ambiance of this place is the only thing that makes me not give it 5 stars. First, it's in the middle of nowhere next to what looks like a bombed out lot. Second, it's tiny (but I guess that's the point) and it lacks in decor. Lastly, it was sooooo cold in there! Bring a jacket! Service: The service was great - the waitstaff was very knowledgeable and friendly and there was never more than 5-10 minutes before each dish was finished and another brought out. Fantastic!
