I came here with a group of friends on a warm summer night after hearing some mixed reviews of the place. There was a very long wait due to the great weather we were having.....so after a about a 45 min wait...we decided to jump at the fist table that popped up inside. We were given chips and there was two kinds of salsa in squeeze bottles at our table. I'm not a big fan of salsa in squeeze bottles, due to the fact that half of it ends up on the table. I wasn't impressed by either salsa, but found that both were decent. We ordered a number of empanadas and I found the chicken empanadas to be awesome. It went really well with the red salsa. My vegetarian friends ordered a plantain empanadas which i found too sweet for my liking. We also ordered guacamole, tostones, and a black bean dip for the table. We were all getting full from gorging on the spread. Everyone really loved the black bean dip. I could fill a bath tub up with the stuff and eat my way out of it. The tostones also were really good when eaten with the black bean dip. I found the guacamole to be a okay. I've had better at Mexican restaurants. I ordered the steak which was served with rice and a cabbage salad. I found the steak to be super salty. Almost to the point of being inedible. The cabbage salad was also a bit bland. Others at the table really enjoyed their food. One raved about her chile relleno, and another loved her grilled vegetable platter. The bill came back to be about $20 a head after eating like pigs......so its a great option for a group of friends...however just realize you might have to wait in a long time for a table.
