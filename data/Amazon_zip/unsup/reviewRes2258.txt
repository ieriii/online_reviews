Hot Doug's is awesome! Besides the typical Chicago style dog, they offer all kinds of sausages, with funny names such as The Salma Hayek (which is a spicy andouille sausage). The bratwursts here are really good. They also offer tons of daily/weekly specials, some of them using exotic meats. I tried their Thai spicy chicken sausage, with seaweed salad and this wasabi sauce. It was finger-lickin' good!  A few things to note. As other people have mentioned, the hours are a bit odd, so make sure to check before heading over. Also, lines can get pretty long on Fridays and Saturdays. Furthermore, this place is not exactly cheap, so don't expect a bargain (though worth it in my opinion!) Most importantly, this is a cash-only operation, so make sure to bring some cash, since you won't find an ATM within walking distance (plus it would be a real torture to smell all that goodness and drool over the menu, only to realize that you have no cash)!
