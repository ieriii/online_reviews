Revolution offers a decent meal selection as well as good beer. The ambiance is nice for anything from a gathering of friends to a date night. I've tried the pizzas, which are all fantastic, the burgers, which are pretty good, and a number of their beers. Speaking of their own beers, recently they have released a new one called The Marquis, which is a great, great Belgian-style Tripel. A couple downsides is how frequently they are out of one or multiple selections of their own beer, the long wait on the standard busy nights, and sometimes the staff takes quite a while to attend to their customers.
