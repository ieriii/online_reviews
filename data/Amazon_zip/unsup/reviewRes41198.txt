Tank is a great place for groups. Came here with a big group--we took up 2 tables--and finally got to try the Pho at Tank Noodle. Our table split an appetizer sampler and an order of the shrimp pancake My favorites were the fresh springrolls and the shrimp pancake. The shrimp pancake isn't your breakfast pancake type, it's more like a very thin omelette/crepe, filled to the gills with fresh beansprouts, shrimp and pork--this is what I'm definitely going to order on future visits. For the main entree, I chose the beef and tendon Pho. I loved the noodles--perfect thin rice noodles, cooked very well, nice texture and held very well in all the broth. The beef was very tender and the tendon not overdone, perfect chewiness. I liked the broth. It was a little bit oily (and sweet?) for my taste, but otherwise ok. Service was good. Not overly friendly, but attentive when we needed something. Huge menu and BYOB.
