THE GOOD: This place is a classic. You walk into a musuem of sausage history plus it seems all the other reviewers have covered the good points. There were many children enjoying. THE BAD: The line. Nothing green. Should consider adding a pickled carrot salad or coleslaw to the menu. THE UGLY: The wait and the distance from the city.
