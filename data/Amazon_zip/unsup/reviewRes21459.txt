I feel badly for being a regular at Mayan and never writing a review. The food is solid. It tastes good. This is not Rick Bayless Mexican, this is no frills Tex Mex. Among other things, you can get a burrito dinner, you can get enchiladas suizas, and you get a lot. The hands down most awesome thing about Mayan is their margarita. They come in a variety of flavors, I have only tried tamarind (delicious) and regular (also delicious) both on the rocks. They are not only delicious but strong (or maybe I am a lightweight) not to mention on Tuesday and Thursday they are half price. Word of advice: be careful, walking down their super narrow hallway from the back room is a challenge if you have enjoyed the margaritas.
