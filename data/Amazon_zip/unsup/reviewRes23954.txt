this restaurant is def on my top 3 fav chinese restaurant in chicago! love the dishes here specifically the shui zhu niu and wu geng chang wang.  i personally feel is a waste to get hot pot at a restaurant since it's something you can easily do at home but my gf loves it (i guess koreans dont do hot pots at home) and it's very well done at this place. but be forewarned: be ready to get very acquainted with the bathroom after eating here, especially if you ask them to make everything extra spicey!
