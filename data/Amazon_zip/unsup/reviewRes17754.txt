Being Indian, I'm very particular about where I would go to have food. India House is the best Indian food hands down in the city. It's slightly on the expensive side, but well worth the money. I would recommend the Naan and Reshmi Kabob (A whitish chicken, that's more mild for an Indian food beginner). You won't be disappointed!
