Opart Thai has by far the best Masuman Curry I have ever tasted! My boyfriend also thoroughly enjoys their Pad Krow Prow and their squid salad is wonderful!! The service has always been descent and friendly and the atmosphere is very comfortable and beautiful! We are able to have 2 meals and an appetizer for under $25. I highly recommend Opart!!!
