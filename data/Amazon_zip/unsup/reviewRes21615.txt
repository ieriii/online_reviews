Visited on a trip to Chi-town. Went for breakfast, and, wooooow. This place is amazing. The chorizo torta is amazing. So many flavors, rich, with a little spice, and the torta break was perfectly toasted. I paired the torta with a cappuccino. They add a shot of their homemade chocolate, which is very dark and unsweetened. It's a cup of heaven. Loved this place.
