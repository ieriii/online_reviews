This place reportedly boasts some of Chicago's greatest new chefs, and the preparation is excellent. The only thing is to make sure you're in the mood for pig, oysters, and beer (really good beer). I can see why vegetarians would have a hard time here, but even a longtime vegetarian friend I took here enjoyed it well enough with some of the veggie options. That being said, the french fries prepared in duck fat with a fried egg on top were a mouthwatering perfection he had to experience vicariously through my girlfriend and I. Some of the choices can be heavy, and it seems that pig parts (the nasty bits) are the "in" thing, which I don't mind at all. It's a great place for a decadent appetite, which for me translates to every once in a while.
