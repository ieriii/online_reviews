Setting: out to dinner with my parents Food: DELISH!!!!  lobster bisque- amaze Crab cakes- fresh and tasty. Could have eaten this for dinner Filet- melt in your mouth goodness. I had a bleu cheese crust. I felt that there could have been more bleu cheese, but I'm guessing they wanted me to taste the steak deliciousness more so than the pungent crust- they were right. New York Strip- tender, cooked to perfection Mashed Potatoes- sinfully buttery and just wonderful Service- Impeccable. Perfect. Pleasant. Our waiter was attentive but not over bearing. Made great recommendations.  Atmosphere- traditional steakhouse. Dark wood, white table cloth, comfy lighting. Upscale but not so stuffy can't relax too uptight upscale. Can't wait to splurge and come back. Next time I think it would be fun ti get a booth in the bar and people watch.
