Coincidentally within the same week, both my friend and my sister told me they had a craving for this chinese restaurant. I'd never noticed this place in the Argyle area since it's just off of Argyle street on Broadway. But man oh man when we walked in, this place was pretty big and very busy! Great spot for parties and groups as long as you make reservations ahead of time. We ordered their famous Beijing duck dinner (only $35 total) and boy oh boy was that TOTALLY worth the CHEAP price! I think this is one of the best peking duck i've had - the meat is really tender and juicy with amazing flavor and perfectly crisped skins. But what I REALLY loved was the Mantou bread that came with the dish to make it duck "sandwiches." I think this is some of the best mantou i've had in chicago - it was really soft, flavorful with perfect amount of moisture from steaming. We ordered a second tray of mantou and i ate my fourth mantou without any duck in it! A broth soup came afterwards that reminded me of the Taiwanese meatball soup that my mom always make - it's very comforting, light, and helps "cleanse your palate" after eating all of that duck and manto. Lastly, a fried rice was served - that was just ordinary chinese fried rice. Totally want to come back and try their other dishes - their menu looked huge and everyone around me seemed to be ordering really tasty looking dishes!
