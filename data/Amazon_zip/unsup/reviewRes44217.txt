We ordered our wedding cake from Alliance. Not only was the tasting excellent (they actually gave us choices to taste instead of slices from the case like other bakeries), but Mitchell was a delight to work with. He had lots of creative ideas and totally worked with us so we could have exactly what we wanted within our budget. All of our guests thought the cake was beautiful AND was delicious. We got many, many compliments on it.  I would highly recommend them due to their professionalism, ease to work with, and both the cake's appearance and taste.
