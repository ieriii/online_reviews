We had really high expectations. - Appetizer: Combination Platter - mozzarella strips, breaded zucchini strips, & breaded mushrooms - nothing special... - Stuffed Pizza - Pepperoni & Mushrooms - again, nothing special.. we expected to be blown away. Our Chicago friends prefer Gino's or Lou Malnati's over Giordano's. Our cab driver preferred Domino's over everything haha. Wish we took their advice and tried a different pizza place while we were visiting. Service was great though!
