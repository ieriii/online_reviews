As I roll up on Superdawg with my friends I am immediately distraught, there was a hug crowd in the parking lot and we were on our way to the airport with little time to spare... No worries it was just Wilco having a photo-shoot on the roof for the cover of Spin Magazine apparently this is there favorite Restaurant anywhere! I Believe it because this place is great! I have been on a quest for my Favorite Chicago style Hot Dog and they deliver a good contender for sure! I also try a whoppercheesy which is amazing and the whole time I was loving the Fries for sure! I got to try a Strawberry shake which was not the best I have ever had but it was till good! While we were there they were sampling cheese curds for possible addition to the menu my friends and I give the fried cheese an enthusiastic thumbs up! The place is just cool no matter how you cut it!
