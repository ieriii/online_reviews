I love this place! It's local, it's family owned and it's amazing. Their menu is well priced, there is a very wide selection of Chinese dishes. Everything is absolutely authentic as well. I'm just bummed I can't have Sun Wah whenever I want because I recently moved to Washington DC. If you have a chance to try this amazing eatery, you should. Don't be overwhelmed by the BBQ in the window either (for the Chinese BBQ virgins!). Ask the staff for recommendations if you aren't sure what to get!
