Hopleaf is so many things. It's a stumble-into-on-a-Sunday-and-have-mussels-for-two type of place. It's divey. It's packed on the weekends. It's the best beer list in the city. It's we-got-a-table-let's-sit-and-drink-and-tell-stories-and-forget-the-time !!!!!! gastropub. It's delicious (CB&J?! Nothing better And those mussels and frites?! Mmmmm.) It's laid back. It's dark and not too loud to hold conversations. Yes, if you go on a Friday or Saturday evening - it will be so jammed with people, it might be a turnoff. But if you happen to snag a table and tuck in for a night of beer - it'll be one of the best nights you've had. Whether it's the atmosphere, the elated feeling of getting said table or the 9% alcohol in your craft beer - it's all worth soaking up.
