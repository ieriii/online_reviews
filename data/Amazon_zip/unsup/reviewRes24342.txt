What's all the hype about???!!! This place is a small dark box in a basement with no ventilation what so ever. Upon arriving to a very dim restaurant ,with just cause if you dared turn on the lights you may just want to turn around and walk out. It was very warm inside and then add the small fires on every table made it feel like a sauna. After the waitress started my fire to heat up the oil I hope she didn't forget the defibrillator to restart my heart ( poor arteries) :/... The bread was stale and the portions are ridiculously small. The prices are outrageous for the quality and atmosphere, the only good thing they have going is the neighborhood. Didn't quite understand why they would put raw poultry next to dipping sauces that go directly into your mouth and is served on what appears to be a dentist plate! So I saved the best for last the chocolate fondue was nothing more then artificial chocolate syrup with some hard rice crispy and old fruit. It you a truly nice fondue exsperience then go to Melting Pot.
