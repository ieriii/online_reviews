The burritos are avocado-laden, the salsa is fresh, the margaritas are strong and the prices are cheap. This is by far the best Mexican place I have been to in Chicago.  I find myself craving the avocado burritos on a regular basis.  Its a great sit-down place to bring friends...the service is always terrible, but I think its a small price to pay to go to a delicious and inexpensive place.  the value is outstanding. One avocado burrito is approx $4.50. Slice it in half, eat one half there and take the second half home. Do NOt eat more than half at one time....or you will have to go home early and lie on your couch, rub your stuffed belly and feel ashamed of yourself.  While I recommend ordering a pitcher of margaritas to share w friends, be careful and do not drink more than 2 glasses...otherwise, you will also need to go home and lie on the couch and feel ashamed of yourself for being so so drunk. If you are someone that can function better than I can when full and drunk , then disregard the above. Enjoy!
