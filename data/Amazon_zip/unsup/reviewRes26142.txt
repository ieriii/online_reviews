Can you marry pizza? I would. This is hands down the best pizza I have ever had in my 31 years of life. The crust is carmelized. Its deep dish (did I even need to mention that?). A former Webster Place dive, a fire made it necessary to remodel it. It used to be vandalized with white out and lots and lots of photos of customers. Now it is remodeled, for the growingly gentrified Webster Place residents. And even though I'm a nice Jewish boy, I can't help but get pepperoni on my deep dish pizza.  The food is great, the wait staff is friendly, and they have a decent beer selection on site. I gave it a slightly higher price point, because once you hoist a few drinks, (and who doesn't when with friends and pizza?), it can get a little more expensive. I've had it for take out, and for eat in. Its perfect after a movie. I have had to wait before, but it is SOOOOOOO worth it. This pizza is fantastic. Worth the trip to the north side. One or two pieces will fill you up. Even if you are a fat hog. Seriously.
