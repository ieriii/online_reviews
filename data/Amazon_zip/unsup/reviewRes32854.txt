came in with my sister and my cousin and ordered the vegetarian messob for ONE and an order of the siga wat. it was more than enough for the three of us and oh so delicious. our waitress, rahel (at least, that was the name on our receipt) was really nice and helpful. shouts to her for making the experience even more enjoyable :) however, for some reason, every time i come here, the food seems to come out kind of lukewarm. if it came out a little hotter, i would say this place is 100% don't skip out on the shiro, it is amazing here. and the tea too! i still have to try their coffee, but i'm sure it is just as great.
