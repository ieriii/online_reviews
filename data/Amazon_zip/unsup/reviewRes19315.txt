Delicious dragon roll or not, don't give me attitude Coast because I've got my own. BYOB Sushi spots should understand that large groups of loud, picky-eating, females looking to get crunked on a budget aka Bachelorette parties are their best customers.Coast was a bit unfriendly to our group of seven and we were actually asked to vacate the table at exactly 9pm. Don't bother asking politely for silverware unless you want to be made to feel like an uncultured simpleton. I'm also not a fan of the one bottle per two people policy (there needs to be a policy?) However, the staff did accommodate my friend's request to make her rolls mild, and they seemed to know the menu very well. The rolls were all great, but the appetizers didn't meet my expectations. The appetizers all seemed to lack the pizazz that the menu described. The Gyoza and Shumai were pretty standard. The asparagus beef was rather bland and nearly impossible to manage as a shared plate (maneuvering rice, sauce, and beef wrapped asparagus with chopsticks was tough). The Tropical ceviche needed some zing. The maki rolls were much better than the appetizers. I really enjoyed my Spicy Crunchy Tuna and there wasn't too much spicy mayo. The White dragon roll was very flavorful and my favorite of the night. The Sweet potato tempura roll was also a highlight. The Tuna on Top had a lot going on, but at $15 the roll wasn't that special. I didn't try the Summer special roll, but others seemed to enjoy it. Coast does have a very nice decor and would be good for a date. I still had a great night with the girls, but I think Kyoto Sushi's Sushi boats, $1 cheaper rolls, huge menu, and super-friendly waiters is better for groups.
