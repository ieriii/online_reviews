Man, the Atrium Wine Bar rocks!  Want steak-frites, but you're not digging the cut that the guys are using? Why not go grab your steak from the butcher in the store, pay the gang $5 extra bucks, and they'll grill it, sauce it and cook up some frites for you! Now, that's what I call SERVICE!  Good show, folks! That move made me a big fan of your corner of the store.
