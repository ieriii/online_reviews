I was looking for a pub with good food. What I found was a treasure trove of cuisine and booze. The Gage goes well beyond "GastroPub". The service was attentive and helpful. The food options consisted of pub favorites and gourmet comfort foods - foi gras, elk, duck, pork belly - to name a few. Great beer list. Great wine list. Great scotch list. I can't wait to get back to this place and try more of what it has to offer.
