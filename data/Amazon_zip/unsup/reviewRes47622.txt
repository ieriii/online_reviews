I've been here twice. Forget Fogo. This is the Brazilian spot in the loop period. I loved the huge selection of proteins they offered! All were excellent. Not just steak medallions on a stick. I also enjoyed the bar of foods. Usually that stuff at Brazilian restaurants are just for fillers, nothing appealing. At ZED451 the "extras" are tasty, modern and the variety is endless. Loved this place.  Get a flight of wine or a bottle of your favorite (my suggestion)!!!!!!!
