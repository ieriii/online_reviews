Great Food 5 stars, Dirty restroom for early sunday brunch and non responsive staff -1 star. Yes, I saw Dale :-) We arrived for 10:30am brunch about 5 min early and waited outside with several other parties while they were getting ready. Got to read the touching story on how this is Dale's come back restaurant. It's beautiful, especially in the from room with the skylights in the morning. Rock walls perfectly lit, mood music, and pretty bright green plants in the background. The brunch selection was what I'd expect, but every dish had a twist. My apple crepes came with a rood beer sauce. My husband's egg's benedict was set on a fried green tomato instead of a bun. These are fun delightful twists. You can skip the frites with wasabi... they were meh. Next to us we saw what I think was a yogurt parfait that looked liked a yummy biology terrarium. If you think different can be delicious try Sprout.
