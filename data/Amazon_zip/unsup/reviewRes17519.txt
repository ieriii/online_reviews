The food: As our apps, we tried the salmone cerviche and the ropas vejas which were both very tasty. In our group of 5, we got 4 different dishes. My favorite would have to be the skirt steak. The meat is so thin, yet so tender and the flavorings were amazing. The pork, braised short ribs and ribeye were also good as well...just not as good as the skirt steak. For dessert, the menu makes you want to order everything on there. The prices were great for what you get. We got the pineapple sundae and the churro's. Both were absolutely divine. I enjoyed every bit of both. The drinks: i had the raspberry mojito which was good, but i think could've used a little more liquor. i was also able to try the capprihina which was also really good. The waiter: Kevin was one of the best waiters we had during our vacation. He recommended dishes, drinks and information about the city. The hostess: We called to make a reservation for 5...showed up and the hostess looked like she couldnt find our reservation. We showed up at 8:45 for a 9:30 appointment time and were not seated till 10:45. Granted this was a Friday night and they were extremely busy I was not happy about this part of my service. After a long day of sightseeing, the last thing you wanna do is wait that long for a meal ESPECIALLY when reservations were made. When we asked how long it would be (around 945) she said "it should be shortly". My overall experience was amazing.
