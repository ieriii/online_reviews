We arrived at 6:30 on a Friday night. Easily found seats at a small table in the bar to wait for a dinner table. They sell wine by the bottle at retail prices and are available to take home, but you can pay a small corkage fee to enjoy a bottle at the restaurant- we paid a reasonable $32 (inc the fee) for a bottle of malbec. 45 minutes later we were seated. I loved everything we ordered: Truffle egg toast (even the accompanying asparagus was delicious) Polenta with ragu of the day (ours was a pork and beef bolognese, we ordered a large for just the 2 of us and finished it) Salmon (this was a special of the day, pan seared filet perfectly cooked and seasoned, served with the most delicious broth and mix of spring vegetables) Wish we had room for dessert but we were stuffed after just the three plates. The service was also 4 stars. The food could have come out faster but everyone was so friendly and attentive that the wait didn't bother me too much. And the ambience was perfect for date night!
