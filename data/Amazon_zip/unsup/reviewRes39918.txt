We were welcomed with 22 side Korean dishes, enough to feed a village in some country's. Quick service and a unique BBQ setup. Kalbi is always an excellent choice with a light sweet marinade. A wonderful place for a fun group event. Perks to opening until 5am, great for late night devouring. Mmmm.....
