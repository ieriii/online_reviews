All of the food here is great - they essentially take "typical" diner food and make it vegan. I thought I did not like seitan until I tried the Gyros here....they are unbelievable!!  Also, the desserts are amazing. Do not leave without getting a milkshake!!! If you are a peanut butter lover, the cookie dough peanut butter milkshake will be one of the best decisions you could make. The "Peanut Butter Puck" dessert is the only item on the menu that is somewhat disappointing.  Unfortunately you cannot make reservations, so you should plan to get there at least 45 minutes before you actually would like to sit down. But by the time you have finished your meal, you will be happy you waited!
