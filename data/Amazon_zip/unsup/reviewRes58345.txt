As a restaurant, eh ... not so much.As a bar that serves food ... Love it!If you go expecting a crowded place with an extensive beer selection that happens to serve food, you will be very pleasantly surprised. Especially if you like mussels. They happen to be one of my favorite foods, so finding a place that serves deLISHous mussels in a casual atmosphere with good beer for reasonable prices is like a little slice of heaven for me. If that sounds like heaven to you, too, go to Hopleaf. Just go early, especially on weekends, or you'll have one hell of a wait for a table.
