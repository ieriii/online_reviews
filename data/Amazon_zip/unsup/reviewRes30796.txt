Was there Friday, January 27 with a few friends. Had some of the best Sushi that I've ever had in my life. The spicy tuna roll was really good but the Tale of Two Tuna was even better. Our server was a beast. He recommended what was really good and told us what wasn't. I'm gonna come back here soon, I'm already craving it.
