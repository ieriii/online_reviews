This is the place to be if you like just about every food on a menu! I would have to recomend the Pasta Telephono! I'm watching my carb count but this is a dish I couldn't resist! The one thing I did not like was the wait but hey I guess everyone agrees that this place is yummy! The service was good and the waitors were very attentive. Overall this place is top of my list to go eat when I come to Chicago with family and friends.
