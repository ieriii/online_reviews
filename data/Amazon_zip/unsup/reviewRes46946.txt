Uncommon Ground is not a coffee shop, as you might assume. It is a handsome bar / restaurant / performance space.  The ambience is near perfect -- both casual and warm. It is equally perfect for a date or for a large group. There is a lively vibe, but remains intimate enough for conversation. The food is usually a real treat, though sometimes perhaps somewhat of a disappointment. They feature fresh ingredients from their rooftop garden! (How cool is that?!)  Also, a great place to have a drink at the attractive bar or enjoy alfresco dining.
