What an interesting new eclectic spot....gourmet but not precocious Sublime music in the background, converse shoes and fancy dresses, it all fits in here! Waitress (Erin) was amazing, chose our wine and beers perfectly for each course, and helped us decide the best dishes (I am painfully indecicive) LOVE: the oyster flight, skatewing, and apple fritter desert I will be back for New Years no doubt! PRO: my foodie bf loved the place CON: he paid more attention to his food then he did to me!
