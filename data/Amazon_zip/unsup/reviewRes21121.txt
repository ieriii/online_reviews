From the outside looking in, Mayan Palace seems to be the right kind of place. Big freggin Margaritas (half price on Thursdays) and a fun a boisterous atmosphere... However, just like the girl with orange complexion in the middle of a Chicago winter... something just ain't right about Mayan palace... All the chicken dishes I had tasted slightly fishy. And when I say fishy, I don't mean questionable, but rather a raw fish aftertaste... I usually polish off everything on my plate, but I left some of the chicken enchiladas untouched. The chicken flautas were better (because the fried shell helped hide the taste of the meat) but I could taste that something was wrong. The service took a while, but I was with a group and sometimes it's hard to service everyone. None the less, I had come from the gym (as most of my reviews go) and I was absolutely starving. Two full baskets of chips and salsa later, plus appetizers and I was already full when the entrees finally came. The chicken fajitas were just okay. They seemed healthy, were fairly bland, but not memorable. I sampled a bit of the Chile Verde, a green salsa pork dish that I believe put my stomach into an uneasy feeling. Not a fan of that dish, but then again I don't like pork all that much. The only real memorable part of the dinner was getting desert which was fried ice cream. Frying + any desert = Good and unhealthy. This was my first experience eating fried ice cream, and I was pleasantly surprised.  All in all, my group and I had a great time hanging out with each other despite the poor food experience. I most likely will not go back to Mayan Palace, unless I am in desperate need of a huge margarita on a random Thursday night. I do appreciate that the staff was nice, and that there was a good atmosphere, but that was not quite enough to make up for their deficiencies
