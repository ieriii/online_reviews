I love this place! I went here on a Saturday night for a 9pm reservation. The place was crowded, but the service was quick. I had the chicken and steak combination, and most entrees are $20. The plantains and rice/beans were to die for!! !! So well flavored!! The service was great, and we brought our own red wine. The only thing I don't like is the $8 corkage fee you have to pay on weekends if BYOB. I highly recommend, but make a reservation. Parking on Lincoln was easy.
