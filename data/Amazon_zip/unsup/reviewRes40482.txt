Great vibe and decor. Went in with four friends and was immediately welcomed and seated. The Wild Boar Sloppy Joe was excellent - knife and fork required. The drink selection was amazing (and the prices reasonable). A great spot for a date, or to bring some friends for drinks and good food. Also, for the second night, they really had their act together. Out waitress split our check (between three different people) without missing a beat. Fantastic service, outstanding food, and some marvelous drinks.
