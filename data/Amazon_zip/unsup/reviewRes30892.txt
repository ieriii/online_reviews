I was vegan with a friend for two weeks and this was our weekend outing. i wasn't impressed with anything except for the shake I had. It was a pretty good vegan shake. Chocolate and peanut butter. The outing started with a LONG, must've been an hour long, wait! While the food wasn't impressive, it wasn't particularly bad, but what lost this place points is that there was paper in my rice... a lot of it. Now, I know there's no animal products allowed in the vegan food, but come on! Paper? =/ Also, it seemed like a lot of this stuff was straight out of the freezer, but I guess there's not much prep short of thawing with vegan ingredients.
