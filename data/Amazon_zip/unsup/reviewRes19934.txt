Fun Gastro-pub... House Poutine w/ Elk ragout: Very very tasty... but quite large for a 1st course. Definitely should eb shared, and even then will be quite filling. The elk ragout is pretty amazing. unfortunately I drank too much wine and forgot to taste the rest of the food when I ate. From what I can remember though, the Amish chicken was good, as well as the braised rabbit salad. ] Definitely want to go back an explore the menu further.
