So I just happened to have watched Andrew Zimmern's show on Chicago and he came to Xoco to try Rick Bayless' Mexican food. According to Andrew, the pork belly soup was the best he ever had. And the tortas was so tasty with delicious bread. My mouth watered while watching it and instantly I called the restaurant and placed a pick up order to avoid the chaos in the dining room. While I was waiting for the order in my car, i kept looking at the clock and couldn't wait to try the food. I ordered the Pepito tortas and the crispy pork belly soup with vermicelli. The tap was $26.58. So I thought, this has got to be so worth it since Andrew Zimmern featured the restaurant on his show. I hurried home to eat. BIG disappointment! HUGE!!! The tortas was a size of McDonald's $1 double cheeseburger. The bread was hard and there were 3 pieces of meat with no taste to it. The soup was bland with 4 pieces of pork belly. I was so mad to the point where i had to let it out. So I signed up with Yelp and this is my first review. I never got ripped off by any place ever. Well, Xoco, you got me!!
