I dined here on a Friday night, and lucky for us the wait was short. We perused their extensive beer list (both draft and bottled) and had a beer while waiting. We were eventually seated in the back room, and I wasn't fond of the lighting... All of the tables had tea lights, but none were lit. The dining room was also incredibly hot. As noted by other reviewers their specialty here is burgers. I got a basic burger ordered medium, and they've obviously made a lot of these because they cooked it perfectly. I ordered the curry fries, and the flavor was great, with just a hint of curry. The fries are extremely crispy, I prefer a more potato-ey texture. They seemed as though they were in the fryer a little too long. The service was lacking, and when we wanted to order another beer the server had to be flagged down. She seemed a little frazzled, so maybe she was handling more tables than she would have liked.  Overall, I fine place if you're craving a creative burger and don't want to wait.
