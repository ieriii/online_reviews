Man I was really looking forward to eating here but unfortunately the experience did not live up to the hype. We ordered the bone marrow, the milk braised pork shoulder the cheese sampler and the calamari. the calamari was excellent and we all really liked the braised pork shoulder. We also decided to add on the pigs ears since we were still hungry. They reminded me of onion strings, only with less flavor. Most disappointing was the cheese plate with three cheeses for $19. Way overpriced considering you can get bigger free samples at a deli or supermarket.
