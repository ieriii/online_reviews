This is my new favorite place. We chose to go at a busy time of the day 7:00PM and brought the dog. (She is a sweetheart, though. I don't think any place would tolerate hyper or loud dogs.) They have a great outdoor eating and waiting area to enjoy a pre-dinner cocktail. Quiet neighborhood. The concientious and friendly owner came out with samples of homemade provalone. He even gave the dog a few slices, and a kiss. Super nice staff, too. The food was extremely tasty. Very traditional in presentation. Fast service. Very reasonable. Love the lemon soda. Italian sausage with fennel is terrific. Pizza tastes like the best NY pie, here in Chicago! Homemade Tirimasu was the best I've had since little Italy in the Bronx, NY. Go early or prepare to wait a while, although waiting is very pleasant. I consider this a "must try" and like I said, it's my new favorite place.
