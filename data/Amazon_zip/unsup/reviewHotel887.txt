When this hotel says they are pet friendly, it is such an understatement! We were travelling with my kitten and the staff could not have been more accommodating. Not only is there no pet fee here, but they actually have pet supplies if you are unable to travel with them. For my kitten, they supplied us with a litter box and pet bed and even watched her for us free of charge in the downstairs back office while we attended a business meeting! On top of being beautiful hotel in the center of EVERYTHING downtown Chicago has to offer, the rooms were classicly beautiful and the staff was beyond friendly. I would highly recommend it!
