We wre in Chicago for only a week and had to check out the deep dish pizza that we've heard so much about. Everyone was right, it is delicious....and very cheesy. We ordered a small for two and that was to much pizza. (4 slices) We also ordered the toasted ravioli since we weren't sure if we'd like the pizza or not. The toasted ravioli was huge...5 on the plate, I think. It had a really good cheese filling, not meat. The waiter was very attentive and noticed that my daughter did not like the pizza and offered her some free chocolate chip cookies...they were huge too! The grafitti was fun and the small booths with lite candles were a nice touch.
