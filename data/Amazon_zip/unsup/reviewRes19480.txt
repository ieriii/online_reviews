I liked everything I tried here-- the pint of shrimp was tasty, the oysters were very fresh and served on a mixture of brown sugar and salt... perfectly highlighting the sweet and briny oysters. The fish and chips were good too-- the batter was light and the fries were perfect (although, I wish they served them with curry sauce, like they do when you get them as an appetizer). My only complaint is the cost-- those three dishes plus four drinks cost over $100! I mean, seriously? For fish and chips? Granted, the beers cost $10-$15 a piece, but frankly, that didn't seem reasonable either.
