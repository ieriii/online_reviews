Just went Friday night for my birthday. A couple of reviews down from a couple that went a day after on the 22nd is pretty much the same exerience I had. Ordered the exact same thing, the grand selection. It takes about 3-3    1/2 hours from beginning to end. Each portion that comes out is small but towards desert, the amount of food almost got to be too much. The service is top notch and the food is cooked to perfection. To me it just didn't seem to be innovative enough. I preferred Moto over this for the same prices. The room was nice and it wasn't stuffy at all despite the requirement of a jacket. I would just suggest a few of the other 5 star restaraunts before tru. It was definetly good-thus the 4 star rating.
