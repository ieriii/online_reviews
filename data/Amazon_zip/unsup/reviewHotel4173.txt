I've stayed here with my boyfriend on two different occasions when we were in Chicago and didn't want to drive back to the suburbs or sleep on our friend's couch. Both times the room was comfortable, clean, and had great views of the river and surrounding buildings. We had drinks and the Spanish pizza from the big bar. My martini (my yelp picture) was giant, probably had about 4 shots in it too. I was definitely feeling a buzz after that. I would recommend staying here to anyone looking for accommodations under $200/night in the city.
