I'm about as close to 4.5 stars as you can be without bumping it up to 5. Here's why: The food itself was phenomenal. I'm not going to go into specific detail as the menu is likely to change by the time you'll go there anyway, just know that it is equal parts playful, beautiful, and delicious. The service was beyond impeccable. By far the best service I've had a a single-Michelin star restaurant. Everyone is friendly. The timing is perfect. They really get the details right. Here's where I take issue with Tru: 1. Decor. I like minimalism. I like modern. And I even like the idea of letting the food, and not the space, be the star of the show. Unfortunately, Tru has taken the idea just a little too far, and the result is a strange waiting area (not a bar) inside from the entrance where you wait for your table, followed by a large dining room that is just a bit too open and generally lacking in character. 2. Proteins. As I said, the food was amazing, and I'd happily order any of the 6 courses we enjoyed again. My problem is that out of those 6 courses (as well as some lovely and unexpected amuse-style interjections between courses), only one was protein based. And that protein wasn't wagyu beef, wasn't sweetbreads, wasn't even pork belly or something similar. It was chicken. Delicious chicken, with some lovely accompaniments to be sure. But chicken is still just chicken at the end of the day. And when you drop in excess of $500 for a meal, I don't think its unfair to ask for some elevated protein options. Among Chicago foodie circles these days its almost impossible to have a culinary discussion without talking about Alinea and Next. I'd humbly submit that despite my minor complaints, Tru still belongs in any serious foodie conversation.
