Mastro's is......good.  I go back and forth between rating this place 4 stars or 3. I went with a small party to Mastro's for my birthday. We had a great time. The room was nice, although VERY noisy...so it was tough to have a conversation. Great energy and the cocktails are unbelievable. You get the whole shaker (as many reviews have discussed), so your drinks are big, BIG, BIGGGG!!! We were there on a Wednesday night at 7:30 pm and it was jam packed. That said, it was fairly easy to get a drink because the bar was adequately staffed, so we were off to a good start.  We started with a few appetizers. The ahi tuna tartare was VERY good. It came with what tasted like tempura crunch and avocado. DELISH! The lump crab stuffed mushrooms were good. Nothing to write home to mom about.  As for the main event, I had the wagyu beef/black angus "hybrid" New York Strip. It's a long winded description for an above average to mediocre steak. With all the fanfare, I thought it would blow my mind. Eh. It was okay. I've had better. Everyone else seemed to enjoy theirs, though. Two had the petite filet (they loved it) and a third got the regular New York Strip. One person was a vegetarian and the chef put something together for her and she liked it. Vegetarian options are limited, but.....it's a steakhouse!!! Sides were yummy too. The mac and cheese, the twice baked potato, the French fries...all yummy. Service was good, although I could tell the waiter wanted to use my name over and over and that felt a bit......forced. He was good, though and efficient.  So, overall, I'd say it's a good addition to a great steak house city. I'd still rather go to Gibsons though, if I had my choice. I'd go back if someone invited me!
