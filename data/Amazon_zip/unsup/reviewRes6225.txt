One of the managers was pretty anal about having our whole party there before seating us. Otherwise, the atmosphere was great, upscale and classy. The french onion soup was blah, the mussels were pretty good (and I'm not usually a fan of mussels). While they are famous for their crusted filet mignon selections, I was rather underwhelmed given the price. I would have much preferred a juicy, ungarnished Ruth's Chris filet.
