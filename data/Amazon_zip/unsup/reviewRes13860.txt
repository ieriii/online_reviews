Edit: The food quality continues to improve, so I'd bump that up to a 4 or 4.5, however the wait is just out of control sometimes. You could easily wait 2 hours to get a table on a Friday or Saturday night. I'd say try it on a weeknight instead, or have dinner elsewhere and then just grab drinks at their brewery on kedzie. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I've been to Revolution Brewing many times, so the stars need to be broken out for different things: The beer: 5 stars, hands down. I dream of Eugene porter. The lunch/dinner menu: 3.5 stars (which isn't possible on yelp, but I'm doing my own scale, so ha.) Everything I've tasted so far is decent, but there isn't a huge selection. I'd normally give this a 3, but the bacon fat popcorn (delish!) adds a half star. The brunch menu (weekend only): 4.5 stars - not a huge selection, but it's eclectic and amazing. I tried the hole in the egg that was served with the beer cheese soup, and it was incredible. The brewery tour: 4 stars - informational and fun, plus it's free!
