Food was very good, very fresh. Loved the ambiance, dark and warm..nice to get out of the spring blizzard we were having. I have to say the best part of the whole experience was the service, our waiter was awesome. I dropped my knife and thought no one noticed then turned to my right and there was a staff member with a new knife, super impressed. Would have given five stars, but found it to be a little expensive for what you get.
