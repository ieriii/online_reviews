Went here with my wife, to utilize a Groupon we had purchased. Overall it was a delicious dinner. We got the house smoked salmon and the grilled sausages for our appetizer, both were good.  For our entrees my wife got the veal paprikash, and I got the sausage stuffed chicken thighs. The veal was delicious and full of flavor. My chicken was good, but nothing out of this world. Also it should be noted that they use the same sausage used in the appetizer to stuff the chicken thighs (not a bad thing, but I didn't realize this when I was ordering). They seemed a little understaffed the night we were there with only one waitress serving 8 or 9 tables, which mean service was a little slow, but that could be because another waitress called in sick, I wont hold it against them. Definitely will return!
