"Musak version of Kuma's" sums it up in four words. This place is boring at best. I went in giving it the benefit of the doubt, but sadly the burgers were simply mediocre. I like that they are trying to do the gourmet burger thing, but they are really missing the mark. Ingredients seemed like they were trying too hard and a leat one on each burger we had definitely didn't work. I liked the short line. Man, the cops love this place. Had about 7 of them in there when we went. Now, everytime I drive past I see a cop SUV outside.
