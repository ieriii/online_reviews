I've been to many wine bars, and the purple pig is one of the best! Where to start??? Location: It's on Michigan Ave which is very easy to get to and filled with stores and people walking around. Since is the holiday season all the Christmas decorations were up and the trees were lit. The Purple Pig sign that you walk under is so unique and leads you to the door! Ambiance: Ok- yes it's loud but it's a wine bar! I could hear my boyfriend with out any trouble so no complaints. I like the community seating for some reason. It just feels cozy! The inside is nice, not over done and not bare. Service: There was an hour wait for 2. Not a big deal- we are on Michigan Ave so there was plenty to see and do during the wait! The hostess girls were SO nice and accommodating. They took our number so they could give us a call when the table would be ready. They were so personable and talked to us as well. Our server was so nice and helpful! She even gave us suggestions on where to eat breakfast since we are out of towners :) Wine and food: The wine was amazing. Best moscato I've ever had! My boyfriend had an appetizer and he said it was so good. He ate it pretty quickly so it had to be bomb! The prices were not that steep either. It was our favorite place we went to on our vacation and we will definitely be back!
