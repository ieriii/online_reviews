I wouldn't rate this as the best deep dish pizza, but it does come close. Stopped in here looking for a quick naughty pizza fix and A.o.P. did just the trick. I love the convenience of the deep dish by the slice...that doesn't taste like gross cafeteria food. The sauce was a bit too acidic for my taste, but the crust was delish. At under $3 a slice you can't go wrong with that.
