All of these reviews likely tell you the various ways and courses that Alinea is incredible. All the "best meals of my life"s and culinary discourses.  But, looking at the price tag and the difficulty in acquiring a table, you may still be asking yourself, "Yeah...but is this just hype or is it Really Worth it?" Let me answer that- IT IS. I could tell how every bite of every course was one of the best, most interesting, most surprising things I have ever eaten and how it has changed how I experience food and dining. I could tell you that the wine pairings were spectacular and pushed each course to yet another level. I could tell you that I was a little starstruck by Grant Achatz and wished I'd snuck in a photo of him creating the final course tableside for people close to us (if I hadn't being playing it "I totally belong here" cool and trying to keep the delivery of that course a surprise).  I could also tell you that the service was formal but personable enough that when we had a 'hands free" course that I was comfy enough to raise mine up ala on a rollercoaster or "look, ma! no hands!".   I could tell you all of those things....but the fact that I was, mid-dinner, scheming how I could save up to come again, soon, may be all you need to hear from me.
