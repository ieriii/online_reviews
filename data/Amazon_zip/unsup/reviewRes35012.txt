sushi x, you might want to stop confusing me. a WHILE back, my now ex-girlfriend and i went here with some friends and had a great time sitting off to the side on some swank couches and drinking our own wine. it was an absolute blast. we lived up north so we didn't make it back much. now i live about six blocks away, but thought you were closed! i'm so stoked i was wrong. last night i ordered delivery, and i think i agree with the reviews that suggest you're really focused on good delivery and take out. the food came in about 20 minutes, in a swank, stylish box, and was absolutely delicious. the spider roll, hamachi roll, and gyoza were all amazing. a bit pricey, but i understand. you're back sushi x. my life missed you.
