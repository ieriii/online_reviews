Yes it IS a miracle! I want more chilaquiles!!! I went here to pick up some tamales for breakfast for the co-workers because I'm a nice person... or a hungry one who doesn't like to eat alone. I opted to also pick up some chilaquiles and I cant believe I've never ordered them before! I LOVE them! They might be better than my moms (dont tell her!) and the tamales are so damn good. I get my fingers dirty all the time but its definately worth it!  Tamales by the dozen $12. Don't forget to get a side of chilaquiles!!!
