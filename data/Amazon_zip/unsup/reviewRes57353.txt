I'm not sure the point of reviewing Coast is there anyone left who hasn't been there. Coast is a typical BYOB local sushi spot. The food is not nearly as good as the heavy hitters (Mirai, Arami) but it is also not nearly as expensive. They offer the normal dragons rolls you would expect. The servise is fine, the ambience is ok (a little loud) overall a decent sushi option.
