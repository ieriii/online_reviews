I'm always on the lookout for a good breakfast and this fits the bill well! I had the salmon and eggs and was impressed by the nice big fillet. The service was fast and everything was well cooked. I felt it was a good amount of food for the price. My only complaint about this location is the noise. The restuarant was only half full but sounded packed due to the ceiling layout/construction.
