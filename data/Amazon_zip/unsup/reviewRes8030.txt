This is the most efficient restaurant that I have been. Everything is great here EXCEPT that the meat is too salty for me. Nice place to dine but I have to minus one star because the meat was too salty for me. Salad bar is fresh. I wish I could eat more meat, but the high content of salt is too much for me. I'm truly impressed with their service.
