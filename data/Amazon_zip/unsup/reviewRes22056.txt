Better than the food I had in Costa Rica. Seriously.  I came here with a big group of 15+. Food was done family style and amazing. The onioned steak entree was the best thing on the menu, sooo good. Yuca topped with Mojo very good, empanadas were delicious. Didn't have sandwiches but they looked really interesting and I want to try them next time. Chicken mixed with rice dinner and veggie side was okay but not amazing. Oatmeal milk shake done with milk (they have a soy option) is to die for. Cash only but BYOB saves you some extra cash. Not fancy but lively with great customer service. I will def be back.
