Twice we've been at this location and twice we have been pleasantly surprise. The food and the service are outstanding. A big kuddos for promoting safe biking by giving a discount to cyclist that wear helmets... We'll be back again and again... this is one the best spots to have breakfast, lunch and dinner in this area of Lake View.
