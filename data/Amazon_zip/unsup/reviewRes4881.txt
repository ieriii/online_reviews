Came here for anniversary dinner on a thursday evening. It was great! I wanted to try this place for 2 years...haha. The European tapas is fun! They don't take reservations. The wait was 1 hour 10 mins. (you can grab drinks and wait out on the patio) We had the CHEESE PLATTER to start. It was delicious. The waitress recommended the Lincoln Log, Gouda, Caveman Bleu . Loved the cheese & grape jam pairing. (hint: they provide extra slices of toast!) Your Best Bets are the BEETS & GOAT CHEESE SALAD & MILK BRAISED PORK SHOULDER. The ground up pistachio nuts sprinkled in the salad was delish. The pork was flavorful and paired with creamy mashed potatoes. good portion! the BONE MARROW with HERBS was stand out. (cilantro, onion, capers, & dash of salt to enhance the flavor. eat it all together in one bite on a bed of toast. I was eyeing the giant GRILLED SCALLOPS at the table next to me...looked mouthwatering.  Skip over Tuna & Lima Beans..nothing special. The crowd is hip, young professional types. We dined indoors...it was LOUD and cramped. In hindsight, I would ask to be seated outdoors for a quiet, intimate meal. The decor was warm & hip...fun date place or special occasion. Attire? Casual (not gym shoes-like..but don't have to doll up to dine.) Fun Fact: Why do the owners call it "the Purple Pig"? apparently, pigs turn purple when they drink alcohol..haha.  Overall, lovely experience. Will be back for more pig!=D
