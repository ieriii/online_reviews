First of all, it is not fancy. It is sort of like a corner diner, Vietnamese style. Menu was extensive and it is too bad I had no idea what most of that stuff was. From what I could read, Pho, is the make or break dish for such a restaurant. So that is what I ordered. I have no idea if what I was eating was good Pho or not, but it was interesting with the tripe and all. The soup comes with the biggest bunch of basil I have seen on a dining table. I wasn't quite sure what to do with it all, but I tore it up and put it in the soup. 54 years going without experiencing tripe. Now I have had it twice in less than a week. Who knew that Chicago was such a tripe haven!
