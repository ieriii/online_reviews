The Purple Pig was one of the restaurants I most wanted to try while in Chicago, but it's an extremely popular restaurant that takes no reservations, and when I called to ask how long the wait would be one night during dinner, I was told 2 1/2 hours! (And another friend who'd called independently was told THREE hours!) But then I noticed the kitchen was open until midnight Sundays, and so decided to wrangle a bunch of friends to go after a Sunday night meeting rather than before, which had us arriving at around 11:15. We STILL had a wait to get seated, but no more than 20 minutes or so. And it was worth it! I think we ordered around a dozen dishes for the five of us, including what turned out to be my favorite -- the "JLT" -- which is Pork Jowl, Tomato, Frisee & Fried Duck Egg. The pork fat and the runny egg yolk mingled perfectly, making it quite a sensual, visceral food experience. We also had Pig's Tails Braised in Balsamic with Grated Egg & Parsley, Roasted Bone Marrow with Herbs, Pig's Ear with Crispy Kale, Pickled Cherry Peppers & Fried Egg and more. Every dish was perfectly prepared. One of my friends is a vegetarian, so we made sure to order three dishes he could have, including the Salt-Roasted Beets with Whipped Goat Cheese & Pistachio Vinaigrette, and they were so good that even the rest of us non-vegetarians enjoyed what he couldn't finish. So don't think vegetarians can't eat well at the Purple Pig -- well, not unless watching others gorge themselves on pig puts them off. Even though we were stuffed, I just HAD to order the panini filled with Nutella, Marshmallow Cream & Bananas -- the perfect gooey way to end the meal. I'm torn between rating this a 4 or a 5, because the food itself definitely deserves a 5, but due to the wait issues, think of it as a 4 1/2. I'll definitely be back ... assuming I can spare the time for a long wait during peak times or can go at odd hours.
