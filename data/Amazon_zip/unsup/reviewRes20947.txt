This gastro-pub is one of my favorite restaurants in the city. We always sit at the bar for a more casual experience, and we have never been disappointed. The bartenders know the menu and are great at making recommendations. The drinks are delicious and creative. I highly recommend the mussels vindaloo, scallops, lobster risotto, fish and chips, and all of the desserts! The lunch menu is also amazing and all of the sandwiches have been perfection. I love this place and you will too!
