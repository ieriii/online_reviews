I recommended this place to many of my friends and I will now tell them otherwise due to the lack of customer service, respect and the embarrassment I experienced on my last visit. I was a frequent customer on there crab leg night and the food was usually good. On my last visit I ordered the crab legs and the sides were corn on the cob covered with parmesan cheese and Cole slaw. I tried to eat my corn on the cob and it was really hard to bite because the corn wasn't cooked long enough, it was no biggie I thought I'll just ask the waitress to give me another one that was cooked a little more. I did and she said oh no problem I'll get you another one. Well, the next one was just as hard and tough to eat, so I just gave up and continued to eat my crab legs because after all I wasn't there for corn anyway. I guess the owners wife was offended that I didn't eat the second one and approached me at my table and asked You don't like the corn? I told her its a little too tough for me and under cooked she then said this in a pretty loud voice and the place is small so anyone around us heard her then say well I just had a piece and its fine! Corn is supposed to be crunchy and I boiled it for an hour so it cant be raw, next time you come ask for asparagus because corn is at a premium right now! I did not expect that at all. I was so embarrassed and pist off after that. I was on a date with my boyfriend and we were spending 80 freaking dollars in that joint. Why was I getting chewed out by the owners wife about a 10 cent piece of corn that could break a tooth. I'm sorry Glenn's wife but if you boil corn for an hour it would be mush!
