Oh Garcia's, you've let me down. I just went back for the first time since the remodel (yeah, been a while) and I am bummed. First, the good: -The bathrooms... such an improvement. It had been two grungy stalls in a cramped room and now they're bigger than my apartment. -The salsa is still incredible. Perfect texture, big flavor, love it! -Much more seating. -Basically the place LOOKS better, but now they need to work on their food and service.., The bad: -I ordered chilaquiles and was not liking it. Pretty sure the eggs (which the waitress confirmed with me that I wanted them) were not there. I tasted sauce and tortillas. Lots of sauce. Sort of soupy. -The staff. Argh! I think it took 45 minutes before my water was refilled. The waitress kept disappearing. We sat there FOREVER after the meal just talking, but also waiting for the check... finally they started clearing the table and hovering so we'd leave... we had to mention the check and they seemed to think we'd already paid. Nope, not yet... but if you'd rather we skip that part, that's fine... The food is not outstanding. There are so many better places here for Mexican food, that if Garcia's wants to stick around long enough to pay off their remodeling debt they really need to step it up.
