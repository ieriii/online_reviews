This place was just OK. I got the white fish, which was the most expensive thing on the menu. There wasn't anything special about it. We went after a Cub's game so it was pretty crowded, but I feel like the service was not attentive, they didn't even bring out plates for our bread and no cheese... what?! We got the banana bread dessert which was good, however :) They also got my date's order wrong... I don't know, I think prices should be lower for the quality of service and food.
