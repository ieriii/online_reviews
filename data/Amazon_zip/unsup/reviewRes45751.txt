My go to restaurant in Chicago. I've eaten here over 50 times and have never had something that wasn't as tasty as can be. The pork chop is one of the best i've ever had and the mac n' cheese is crispy on top and smooth underneath. The atmosphere is so cozy and comfortable and they have the unique ability to make you feel warm and comfy in the winter and cool and relaxed in the summer. Great place and I recommend this to every person I meet that is new to the area.
