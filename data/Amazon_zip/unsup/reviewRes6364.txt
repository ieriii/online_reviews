I really like this place for their Pizza's. My favorite is the Prosciutto and Arugula Pizza. They have a good wine selection that you can buy at retail and pay a $7 corkage fee. If you are having dessert try their pear bread pudding with a side of gelato. Make sure to make a reservation or be ready to wait hours. Parking is available on the street but they also have Valet available. Service was good and fast and the food is just perfect.
