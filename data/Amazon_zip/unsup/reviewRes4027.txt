F*ck the pedantic pretentious pageantry of so called "fine dining." F*ck using the "right fork" and choosing the "right wine" and getting all dressed up like the Queen of England when you're just Bob from accounting the next morning. And f*ck you for making me put on a jacket. I get enough of that at work.  At Schwa, you're eating a mind-blowing meal cooked by hard working, bad motherf*ckers. It's upscale for the proletariat. It's food on par with Alinea in every way that actually matters. If you're reading this you likely already know that it has some quirks. These quirks don't exist to attack your lofty sense of self importance; they exist because Michael Carlson operates his business the way he needs to in order to deliver the best food he possibly can to your table. Made a reservation on the first call. Kiss my bitter Greek ass. The gorgeous, amazing girlfriend and I are both vegetarians, and chef didn't blink about it. We had no idea in advance what we were eating, as is always the case with prix fixe veg outside of seasonal vegetable menus from Trotter's, Avenues, etc... Accordingly, we brought a bottle of Martinelli Pinot, an Argentine Chardonnay, a bottle of Alsatian sparkles, and a second similar sparkler for the kitchen. We opened it all and paired as we went. Super duper rad. Apparently the best pairing for any meal is to have your favorite bottles open all night and to take whiskey shots with the kitchen. Hell yes. We poured a glass of the Martinelli for Chef and he called it "barn-yard-y." In a good way. Brilliant. Next time I'll bring wine for the adjacent tables as well.  The food was beyond rad and made us giggle like Dick Cheney eating a baby. There was foam and other molecular fun, but the focus was on flavor above everything else. Restaurant owners, remember. the godd@mn food actually needs to taste good. Innovation is meaningless without substance. Schwa pulls both off with aplomb. Already plotting our return.
