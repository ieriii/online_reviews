One of my favorite restaurants in Chicago! You absolutely have to try the ricotta and honeycomb- it is my favorite thing on the menu. The risoto carbonara is consistently good (and very rich), the pizzas are huge and delicious, and we like to order the polpo con rafano (if you like octopus). For dessert, you must try the torta bacio. Nice wine list and the servers are very helpful with suggestions. I nice change from the typical restaurants on Taylor St.
