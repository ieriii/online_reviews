Having been to Barcelona and sampling authentic tapas there, I know what good tapas taste like! I thought everything I had at Mercat a la Planxa was amazing. The ham prosciutto we started melted in your mouth and the cheese pairing suggested by our waitress was a great compliment. Our waitress was attentive and very helpful - she brought out three wines to try (on the house) and after having sampled we could choose the one we liked the best. She had great taste too. She also brought us a sample of the lamb prosciutto and the ham prosciutto which was so good we had to order a full dish. We also had mushroom risotto, baby octopi, and great bruschetta. The stuffed caramelized dates over a cabbage salad with a blue cheese dressing was the best thing we had all night! I would highly recommend this restaurant for the adventurous types wanting to try something new!
