I really enjoy hanging out at this place after work. I absolutley adore the way it's decorated, it feels like an old library/old frat house. The service is always great and they have a nice variety of foods, my personal favorite is the burger, which is generously portioned and always cooked to perfection.This place is casual and fun and I highly recommend it if you are in the area.
