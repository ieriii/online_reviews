Very pleasant place attractively decorated with ample street parking. The service is pleasant, but slow. The price point is a bit on the high side. The food is interesting, organic and flavorful. The coffee is pretty good, not great. The husband and I have lunched here a couple of times following morning doctor appointments and lab work. The food is pretty good. The portions are about right.
