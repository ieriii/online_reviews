This used to be my best kept Chicago secret for sushi, Thai and the like. Since the expansion I had to take a star away. The food is still great but I think they are having growing pains. The dishes I recommend are the sushi regular, seafood madness and the chicken pad Thai. You can't go wrong with any of these. Sitting by the window as you walk in can get a little cold in the winter but that goes without saying. Oh yea! They are BYOB too!
