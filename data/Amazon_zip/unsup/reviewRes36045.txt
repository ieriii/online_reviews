My husband drools over Sun Wah and I had always refused to go when it was in its old location since it looked like you had a pretty good chance of getting sick when eating there. Since they opened up the new, nice! space, I agreed to go. We had the peking duck which was delicious. However! they take the duck to the back and make you soup and duck fried rice. Every bite of the rice I had, I bit cartilage. I immediately lost my appetite and just wanted to get out of there. Suddenly everything made me feel quesy - I guess I'm too much of a weakling because my husband says I should just expect that. Sorry, I don't need to experience that again.
