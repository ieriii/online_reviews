Last summer, I had cravings for Chicago style dogs so I tried out a bunch of different dog stands (ok maybe not stands but you know what I mean). I really like SuperDawg. The place is a drive-in complete with waitresses serving you at your car hanging the tray on your windows. The hotdogs are big and tasty! Along with the dog, you get a wedge of pickled green tomato. I've never had one before, but now I'm a fan of the sour green tomato. I wouldn't exactly call SuperDawg's dogs Chicago-style (and I don't think they do either) since it's not served with a wedge of pickle nor does it come with celery salt. But still, it's delicious!!! Btw, when you pull up into a spot, don't park too close to the menu and intercom. Leave enough room for the tray and for you to open the door if necessary. Once I didn't and I couldn't reach the call button and couldn't open the car door. I was stuck inside my car. It was lame. =)
