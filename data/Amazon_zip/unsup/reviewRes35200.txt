Chinese BBQ is my favorite food of. all. time. When I went to school in Michigan, where such foods were unavailable, I would call and complain to my parents in NY - going even as far as to suggest that they overnight some delicious goodness from Flushing, Queens.  I'm glad to finally be in a city where I can get my roast duck, bbq pork, and soy sauce chicken on rice - with chinese veggies and half a salted egg. This is chinese comfort food. I can never, ever tire of it. Sun Wah does an excellent job of maintaining the juiciness and flavor of the meat, which is difficult to master. Can't tell you how many times I've had lackluster chinese BBQ in California. Peking duck is a real favorite here, but I have yet to go with enough people to try it. Seems to be a pretty efficient ordering process. I will definitely return, especially because I'm moving nearby..
