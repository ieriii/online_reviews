Ok I don't get all the haters here. Of all the Chicago deep-dish pizzas this place is my favorite! They have an awesome lunch special...personal deep-dish with a salad or soup and a drink for $6.97 with tax. You can't beat that. But this place isn't good just for lunch. Their menu is huge. Anyone can find something they like on it. The service has always been extremely quick and friendly in my book. The pizza is frickin delish. The crumbly buttery crust with a robust and chunky marinara sauce...ahhhh I just ate yet still could go for a small slice. I admit, the prices are a tad high. But that's Chicago. Everything is expensive. And for the people on here complaining about the wait for the pizza...that's what you have to do for something delicious made fresh to order. For others complaining about the wait for a table...DUH! That's a sign that you're at a good restaurant with good food. If it wasn't good the place would be empty. I have tried Giordano's and Lou Malnati's and other places for deep-dish but nothing comes close to Gino's. Sorry. I will keep coming back.
