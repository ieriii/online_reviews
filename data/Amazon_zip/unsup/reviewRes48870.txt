The best brunch I've ever had. The zucchini bread with ricotta, honey and fresh peaches set the tone for an amazing spread of food. This is one of those places where every bit of food is perfectly prepared and plated for the diner's enjoyment. I will be going back (soon) to try out their dinner menu.
