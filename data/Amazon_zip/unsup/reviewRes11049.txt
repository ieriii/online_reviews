YUM! One of the best spots in Wicker Park. It is a great atmosphere as well. Piece has a lot of TVs, a pretty decent sized bar and a lot of seating. As far as the food and drinks go, I was happy with the pizza and the beer selection was good. I got the Golden Arm, which is a lighter beer. The service was not bad either, so overall if you are thinking of going to Wicker definitely check out Piece, you will have fun!
