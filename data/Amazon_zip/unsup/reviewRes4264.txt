I must have been in the wrong frame of mind to really enjoy this place. I know it's a jazz club and I was totally prepared to pay a pretty hefty cover upon entering. $12 wasn't so bad, but I was highly, highly turned off when the bouncer very bluntly (and meanly) said that there is "absolutely no talking once you enter and the performer begins." Really? No talking at all absolutely ever?  That immediately set the tone of this place for me. Fairly pretentious staff, annoying patrons and insanely expensive drinks. I paid $5 for a diet coke. Awesome. I'm sure I'll be back in the future, hopefully when there's someone that I actually want to see. However, as of my first experience here, I wasn't at all impressed and I just can't see myself coming here to hang out and listen to some jazz.
