The Chicago Diner is a little slice of heaven for vegetarians everywhere. Their menu is filled with meatless cuisine for the discerning vegetarian, vegan, or omnivore willing to see what meatless cuisine can taste like. Most dairy and egg on the menu can be substituted on request for added vegan friendliness. Their food comes in generously priced and sized portions whose origins span globe. Plus, with items like Peachy-Keen Cobblers and Green Eggs and Ham, it's hard to go wrong even while staying local. (Though really, the spinach/portabella quesadillas are well worth trying.) As an added bonus, patio seating is available in the back when nice out.
