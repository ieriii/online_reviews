I was so excited to try this place. I have read amazing reviews both on yelp and in different Chicago magazines. So one night, my girlfriends and I decided to go check it out. To start off, the ambiance was definitely nice. I have to say I liked the interior and the decor, but there was no hostess in site and we had to wait 5-10 minutes before anyone came to greet us at the door. We were seated at the bar because there was a wait for tables, and that was fine enough- I don't mind sitting at the bar. Unfortunately, our bartender/server was so busy with the other customers that he rarely came to our side to see if we needed anything. All of these things would have been tolerable and okay if the food had been good... I was really looking forward to having some innovative, fresh, flavorful Italian dishes but we were so disappointed. I had the octopus (polpo con rafano) -- it had one tiny little tendril of an octopus leg, which was burnt, so I ended up eating the almonds and sauce only, because the 1 octopus leg was inedible.  My friend had the rigatone (Paccheri con Salsiccia e Pomodori al forno) which was probably the worst dish. It was a few pieces of rigatoni with a mediocre bolognese sauce at best. Homemade sauce or something eaten out of a chain Italian restaurant would have been better. My other friend had a linguini with shrimp dish, except, we couldn't find the shrimp. There were 2-3 small pieces in there. I was very disappointed and will not be going back. We left hungry, unsatisfied, and paid a lot of money to be hungry. Quartino's, Francesca's, Vivo are hands down way better choices any day over this place. I am sad to say I did not have the same experience so many other yelp reviewers did. The only reason I am giving it 2 starts instead of 1 is because I thought the ambiance was nice.
