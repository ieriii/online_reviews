Have you ever been made love to? It was like that. Sprout was most likely the best dining experience I've ever had. Arrived with three other friends and were treated to a dinner like no other. We enjoyed the tasting menu with wine pairings and I left wishing every meal could taste like this. I truly believe the tasting menu with wines is the only way to enjoy Sprout mostly because it's their way of designing the meal around their strengths. Cucumber Soup: served cold with sour cream, herbs, and a flower. Taste buds were pleased, the wine pairing shot me through the roof. Watermelon : with foie gras and lime. I didn't know watermelon could taste like this. Short Ribs: tender, delicious, wonderful. New York steak: with house made worcestershire was a moment worth extending as far as I could. I'll admit my taste buds were probably biased because I didn't just have dinner, I enjoyed an experience. The tasting menu felt as if every dish with its wine was designed to caress your taste buds and leave you wanting the next. We commented on how any salad we've ever had always tasted like lettuce and ingredients; the salad here felt as though every part belonged there, nothing tasted out of place. I tried to make every course last as long as possible. I was amazed. I thought I knew what great food tasted like. Wow. The price is up there but I'm definitely saving up so I can come back.
