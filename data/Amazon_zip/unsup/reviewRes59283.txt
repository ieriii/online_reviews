I think the Sushi and Thai combination is a little wore out in Chicago, however Indie Cafe pulls it off quite well. The only problem I had was with the dinning area, it was really small and you practically are sitting in you neighbors lap. Aside from the seating the Thai Curry was great and my husband had some very good and imaginative sushi dishes. Indie Cafe offers delivery, which will be how I eat with them again considering my distaste of the dinning are. I would recommend this place to anyone!
