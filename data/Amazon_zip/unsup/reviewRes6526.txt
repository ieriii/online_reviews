went for brunch, no wait, liked the room server was bad, didnt bring spoon for my friends coffee when it was served or when she asked for one ordered a bottle of pellegrino and my glass was never refilled even though she put the big bottle furthest away from me on the table my daughter had the Uovo in Raviolo 'San Domenico', it was served room temperature and it was very hard to cut even with a knife i had the Pizza con Prosciutto e Rucola and it was ok my friend had an egg dish and asked the server what what one of the ingredients was and she didnt know one one person bathroom for the whole place, the other one was broken finally she asked if we wanted a dessert even though she never brought us a dessert menu, so no thanks, we went to marios for an italian lemonade
