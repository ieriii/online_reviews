I had never heard of "New Haven style" pizza before going to Piece, but I have to say that I really liked it. Piece is basically a huge sports bar that looks like it was built inside of Noah's ark, and even though it can get pretty noisy in there, the volume was never so loud that I felt I needed to shout at my friends just so they could hear me. I'm definitely going back there sometime soon to have their pizza again; it wasn't the absolute best that I've ever had in Chicago, but it was good enough that I'd easily recommend it to anyone who's never been there before.
