Being a single guy who doesn't do a lot of cooking, I have to rely on La Villa. Deliveries are always on time and piping hot. The thin crust pizza is very good, but I suggest "well done" for crispy crust. They also deliver six packs of beer.  Everything on the menu is great. And trust me, I've been around the world at La Villa. The wings are so hot and they have no sauce on them. If you like hot wings, you have to try them. The antipasto for two is also delicious and plenty for 4. The resturant could use some work, but I don't complain as long as the food is good. A very small bar, maybe about 10 seats. Giant tv lurking behind the bar makes for great cubs games if you get there early. Staff very friendly and accomodating. Haven't seen the banquet side, but they are always having some kind of party over there.  A must try if going by or if you live in neighborhood.
