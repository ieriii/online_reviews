I really like eating here and the apps and rolls are very good.  I've eaten the ones below: Yellowtail Ceviche (yummy) Spicy Trio Roll (very yummy) Rainbow Roll (very yummy) Summer Roll (very very yummy) White Tuna Jalapeno Maki (very yummy) Yellowtail Scallion Maki (very very yummy) I like that they don't have a corkage fee. What I don't like is to be pressured out of the restaurant. I understand that it's busy but I don't like to be pushed out! So that's why I did not give 5 stars.Overall the service is pretty decent and the staff are nice.
