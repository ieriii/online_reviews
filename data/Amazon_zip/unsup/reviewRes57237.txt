Very impressed by the Bad Apple. We went on a Friday afternoon and had no trouble getting right in. The beer selection was top notch. Plenty of great craft brews from all over this great country and beyond. The food was fantastic. All 5 burgers ordered at our table received rave reviews. The different fry seasons were also a huge bonus. I ordered the firecracker fries. I was pleasantly surprised at the burn they offered. Spicy, but also very flavorful. The only thing that keeps this from getting a five is the service. Considering the place wasn't that busy and there were 2 server and a bartender, we should have never had an empty beer for the 10 minutes we did. All in all, I will be back.
