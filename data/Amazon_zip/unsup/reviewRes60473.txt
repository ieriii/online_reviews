I had high hope for this one. My sister thought it would be a good place to take our Dad. Here is what I liked and didn't:WHen i asked the waiter to explain the ingriediants in a few dished (the menu is very italian and used the not-so-usual italian items, he was kind of rude and answered my questions by repeating the same words i asked for an explanation of. It took hi 10 minutes to get our drink order and no bread was brought out for 20. When my dad asked for some olive oil and cheese acted like that was a so wrong. The place in nice enough. The have a cool garden. The meal itself was very good. tasty. But even though we were not expecting family portions, the portions we received were very small. $14 for 6 small ravioli? My Bucatti was small as well. Enough to fit in my hand. I think it was kind of a rip-off. They did have a good and extensive wine list.
