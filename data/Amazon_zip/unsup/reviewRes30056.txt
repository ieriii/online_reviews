Great Vegan find! I love Vegan brunch and this place does it and does it well. Cinnamon rolls are top notch; fluffy and frosting is creamy. Pancake combo was delicious. Tofu scramble well seasoned. Best thing about this place was the service. Everyone who works there acts like they really want to be there. Smiles, even on a Monday right after St. Patrick's day shenanigans!
