I came here on a Wednesday for a 6:00 pm reservation. Beware: As I am an out-of-towner, I wasn't aware of the brutal traffic situation to get here from the Loop. It took over 30 minutes! When I got there, I was surprised to see the restaurant fairly empty, only a couple seated tables in the very front section. The staff was attentive and friendly and offered up some insight on how to interpret the menu descriptions. I would've loved to try the tasting menu, but instead opted for an appetizer and entree. Following the suggestions of my waiter, I chose the Veal appetizer and the Rabbit entree. The Veal was super tender but the escargot tasted somewhat bland. The Rabbit was served two ways and tasted great. I was a bit surprised to see the blueberries My friend had the Zucchini for dessert which I tried a bit of. It was an experience of flavors that I thought would never work together. Zucchini topped with curry...carrot ice cream...beets...chocolate crumbs... Overall, it was an interesting dining experience. There were some unique combinations of flavors that were completely new to me....some that worked well and some that were just OK. The presentations were lovely for every dish.
