Excellent competition barbecue and sides with a comfortable atmosphere. I was in town on business, and we found ChicagoQ using our online tools. When we first arrived, we were told the wait would be about 30 minutes (8pm on Wed night), but it was only about 10 minutes at the well-stocked bar before we found our seats waiting. Appetizers: The variety is just fine, we had the VERY good hush-puppies. You get 5 golf-ball sized puppies, very tasty with chunks of bacon etc. This was what everyone around us was ordering too, so I can't comment on other appetizers much. Entree: At our table, we had both types of competition ribs (baby back and St. Louis) as well as some pulled pork. The pork was fine, but not what I wanted. The ribs come dry-rubbed and smoked, without sauce. There's a side-cart with 4 sauces that are tasty enough, but you almost don't need them; the ribs are so good even without. This is the chef's competition recipe, and it shows. Sides: We ordered the Kobe baked beans. Apparently, they take the tips off the Kobe beef ribs (also on the menu) and make up a skillet that's about 40% beans, 40% rib tips, and 20% sauce. VERY good with not a small kick. We rolled ourselves out of there for about $120 for the 3 of us, though if you go for the regular ribs you could probably shave $30 off. Dessert? No chance... there was no room left.
