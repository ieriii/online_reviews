My neighbor told me that you offer a neighborhood rate so I called and asked about it. Not only did I get forwarded to a different person after the receptionist couldn't answer my question, but the guy who answered was like a robot. He not only made it sound really complicated to get a discount as a local, but he kept trying to change the subject by telling me about the hotel. I just wanted to know the bottom line and STILL don't know the answer to my question. Pathetic. Maybe the hotel stay would have been better but the robots get in the way.
