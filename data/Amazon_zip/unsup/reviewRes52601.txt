Great place for a date or with your girlfriends. Apart from the salad bar, they also had hot side options to choose from, like scalloped potatoes and warm pastas. There was also a soup, lobster bisque I think? The place is huge! Two floors, but restroom only upstairs. There's a huge wine selection where a girl gets swung up and down to retrieve bottles, what an fun job. Service was great! Their special house cut of meat (looks like a C) was probably the best cut in the house.
