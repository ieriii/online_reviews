Overall Coast offers everything a quality sushi bar should...except for alcohol. It's an BYOB restaurant, which I didn't know until I sat down and looked at the surrounding tables. Luckily the convenient store one block south on Damen sells wine. Anyway, a friend and I had the Soft Shell Crab appetizer, 3 large rolls for dinner (which we couldn't finish) and the bill was only $38. It was terrific tasting sushi at a great value. If driving, expect to pay for valet. Parking options in that area are slim.
