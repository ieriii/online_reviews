So now I'm a bad apple (diet-wise) but it is SO worth it. Throwing my salad tendencies out the window, on two separate occasions, I went with the Ole Imperial and the Big Texan. Both juicy, flavorful, and on alternate breads--the Ole Imperial being on an English muffin, the Texan on Texas toast--I couldn't have asked or received a more delicious burger...both times! And the fries aren't anything to scoff at, either. Next on the Bad Apple non-diet menu: the cheese curds! This place just keeps getting better and better. OH and if you'd like to not wait for a half hour, go on a Wednesday night at 9:15pm and get seated, served, and checked almost immediately. While taking your sweet time, of course!
