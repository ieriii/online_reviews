Ok....Coast is my favorite Sushi place...we try to go as much as we can ..this are the things that I love: 1 is BYOB, there is nothing better than your own wine 2 White Dragon Roll........we order at least 2 or 3 everytime we go 3 Great ambiance and crowd Because of being so popular there is always a wait of an hour or more.. =( but they do take reservations, which is great, also the service is ok and sushi takes a while..but all the cons go away because of the awesome white dragon...love it
