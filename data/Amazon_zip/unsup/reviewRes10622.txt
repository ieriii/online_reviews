I went to Piccolo Sogno with a large group, four couples, eight people. My fiancee had heard good things about it, so we were looking forward to it. We were sorely disappointed. The main problem was the waiter hard selling us on a pasta dish with white truffles. What he didn't tell us was that the white truffles were a $45 upcharge. Two of us bit on it (literally and figuratively), and didn't find out about the upcharge until we received out check and saw an additional $90 on it for the white truffles. When I asked the manager about it, he went back into the kitchen, came back out, and essentially called me a liar because I had told him earlier in the evening that I had been to Siena, Italy the previous summer, had bought some truffles there, and now didn't believe me that a whole jar only cost 20 euros. He told me that I knew or should have known how much they were. No, they should have told before we ordered them. It was incredibly embarrassing because we then had to split up the bill evenly when two of us had the lopsided upcharge for the truffles. On top of all this, the service was awful. They gave the wrong dishes to the wrong people, and had an incredibly brusque, contemptuous attitude, brushing by our backs harshly and rudely. It was incrediby crowded, I guess owing to its undeserved popularity, but I would never eat here again. The decent-tasting pasta dish was not worth an undisclosed $45 upcharge for the truffles.
