So close. The food is there: potee luscious, mussels silky, the oysters brilliantly briny. (They have a nice oyster pot roast, too, with crunchy parmesan, ramps, and sorrel on top.) They also secretly make some of the best veggie sides in town. Get this: grilled asparagus are set atop a pile of grits whipped with mascarpone, draped with hazelnuts and doused with olive oil. Frighteningly good. If there is a flaw, it's still dessert: the chocolate budino cake was box-cake level, saved only--but not entirely--by a lime sorbet that seemed to get more complex the longer it lingered on the tongue. Afterthought, still. Knock knocks: the initial half-assing of getting us table. We were told, with a good half of the restaurant unfilled, that they could only sit us at the bar; when that was not ideal for my hearing-impaired friend, they told us a table might be available in an hour. We passed and were headed out the door when the hostess said there was always the option of the communal seating. Um, what, is that not a table? Fine, we said. She apologized--and then sat us at the worst part of it, the corner. And we were among a mere three people at the darn thing for the better part of an hour. Seriously, c'mon.
