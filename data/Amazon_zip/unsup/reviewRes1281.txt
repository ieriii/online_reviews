This place is worth the special trip. On a Thursday afternoon around 4pm, we waited in line about 45 minutes. I recommend checking their website for daily specials. I had gone for the foie gras dog, but it wasn't on that day. Also, Duck fat fries are Friday and Saturday only. Doug is an awesome guy. I'd wait in line just to have him take my order any day! He even bought us drinks because we said we were in Chicago just to go to Alinea (and drop about a grand on dinner). A must stop when in Chicago!
