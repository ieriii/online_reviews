So I went to Graham Elliot last night, and I have to say that I'm kind of over this whole molecular gastronomy thing.  It's a nice enough place, great decor, a cool space, and the food was really good, but a deconstructed caesar salad? Seems like a lot of work for a couple of pieces of lettuce. Listen, I appreciate technique and creativity, but after my cocktail made by a 22 yr. old SUPER COOL GUY/MIXOLOGIST dude which had some sort of whiskey, old tom gin, aperol, concoction that I'm sure had several other ingredients that I'd never heard of, whatever thing, I was already sick of it. At that point I just wanted a salad, a steak, and a tumbler full of rye whiskey. A caesar salad smeared out over a 4 square foot sized plate, and then some sort of wagyu beef dish with everything scattered around the plate's negative space I had eye rolled so much that I just pilled everything together in the middle of the plate and just tore into it. And it tasted good. I'm not saying it's bad or anything, again the technique and the creativity was definitely there, but I'm just done with the super cool, super hip, thing. For the price I'd rather have gone to Gibson's.
