This is one of my absolute favorites. They think about what they're doing and are trying to perfect their dishes as best they can. I've had the current 5 course menu twice and there were subtle yet noticeable differences in plating, textures, etc. Both times the meal was stellar. The building itself feels cramped (even moreso if you're waiting for a table), yet the seating itself is comfortable. Service is friendly, attentive and warm. Free street parking is a nice plus; I've always found a space within a block or two of the restaurant. The neighborhood isn't the best, but it's a lot better than it used to be and seems to be gentrifying by the moment. The only negative is that if you're with a party of three or more, it may take some time to be seated, even with a reservation. The pacing of the meal is very relaxed, and diners tend to linger. Tables for couples are usually available promptly. This is one of those places that is not cheap, but definitely worth it. They've done Groupons twice in the last year or so. I highly recommend buying a few if they're ever back as a Deal of the Day. P.S. The menu is slated to change in a couple of weeks. For anyone interested in going, do so now and order the five course option. The pork chop entree and the banana bread pudding dessert are two of the best dishes I've ever eaten anywhere, and the rest of the meal is excellent, as well.
