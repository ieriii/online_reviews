We stopped by after a day at antique stores in the area. The food wasn't bad by any means, but we were a bit underwhelmed by the entire place. If you're a fan of Neapolitan pizza, you'll probably love the place. If you aren't a purist though, you might be a bit underwhelmed by the prices and proportions.
