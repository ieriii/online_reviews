Such a great experience at this place. I went to meet up some friends and had a variety of cocktails. Such an upscale place and a great venue for either happy hour drinks, dinner or dessert. Their manhattan is amazing to sip and their service is of the highest caliber, ensuring they educate you on their methodology and flavors that they put in every drink!
