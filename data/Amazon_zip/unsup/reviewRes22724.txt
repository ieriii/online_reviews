I'm seriously trying to change my diet. I want to eat healthier. Natural, non-processed food. So, I got Superdawg here earlier this week, and it tasted different to me. It was good Superdawg weather and I got it the same time I usually do (at night) but something was off. Maybe I wasn't as hungry as I should have been, or maybe it was just guilt. I don't know. Whatever it was, I will still eat at Superdawg. Superdawg will still be my comparison for all things beef (tube or patty shaped), sodium, and nitrate related good that will kill me.
