Ever since seeing this sweet little place on check please my companion and I have been dying to go here. We finally trekked our asses to the north side, a huge ordeal for us, seriously. We were surprised that the place was so roomy. We got seating right away on a Friday night at 7pm.  Our service started off very quickly, we got our appetizers and first round very quickly. The mussels were delicious, they tasted as good as they looked. My companion and I both agreed the frites were the best ever and the beer complimented the food perfectly. Our entrees slid onto our tables just as we finished our mussels. I got the lamb stew, he got the pork belly. Our food was not as exciting as our appetizer. The pork belly tasted like giant charred bacon slices and my lamb stew felt like a cholesterol bomb. The most disappointing part was that we barely saw our waitress again, she didn't even bother to ask if we wanted another round. WTF, I came to indulge in a cornucopia of yeasts and ales, why did I only get one round? We barely made a dent in our fatty food feast and spent the rest of the night impatiently waiting for our check. Don't get me wrong, I would come back to the hopleaf, but next time I will stick to the mussels and maybe a salad and hopefully, MORE BEER!
