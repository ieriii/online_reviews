My favorite szechwan and chinese place in chicago. If you like hot and spicy food, you have to be a lao szechwan fan. The chili platter is my favorite appetizer and the innocent sounding but deadly tasty boiled beef as the entree. Don't be fooled by the name - it is beef and it is boiled, but the dish is not about beef or being boiled. it's about the sauce infused with szechwan peppers. Just like everyone else, I also like the green beans and 3 chili chicken. Overall, very good food but it's been toned down in spice levels the past few years to cater to a more mainstream audience.
