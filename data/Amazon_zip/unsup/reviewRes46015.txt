This is a great place to come for lunch. Their portions are double or triple of what you can eat...I love to take home leftovers though. Their salads are fresh and lightly dressed. I hate salads that are over-dressed. They are well-known for their desserts and rightfully so. You have to order them in the beginning of your meal, because they come out fresh. Their key-lime pie is some of the best i've ever had! The restaurant itself is huge!! There's usually a bit of a wait around lunch time. I always find an open table in the bar section.
