I can't believe it's taken me this long to check out Sunda. I work in the neighborhood, drive by every day and LOVE sushi. I was given the choice of where to go for a business lunch - Sunda it is! I think the atmosphere is much more conducive to the sexy night time crowd. Very modern, dark, lot's of black. I like it and look forward to going back this weekend for cocktails and sushi with some friends. There was a nice lunch crowd but no wait and the service was excellent. My companion went off the menu a bit and the chef actually came out of the kitchen over to our table to make sure he was on the same page as her - super friendly and accommodating! It was a very light lunch and not too adventurous; avocado roll and shrimp roll. It was very fresh and well made. The only thing I would change is that they don't leave the soy on the table so I ran out. It was a no cocktail lunch but the story will be different for dinner with my gals! Update coming soon...
