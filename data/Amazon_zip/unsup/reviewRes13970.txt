Definitely a solid go-to spot for good, inexpensive Cuban food. I came across this place when my buddy moved into the area and figured I'd give it a try.. I was immediately a fan of the big open patio! I ordered the mariquitas (fried plantain chips) and they were awesome.. it was a very generous serving and it was drenched in a garlic topping which was right up my alley. The entrees my fiancee and I ordered we all tasty but not as authentic as I would have hoped for. Don't get me wrong.. they were all good but the spices may have been "watered-down" slightly to suit the American palette.. then again, I've been lucky enough to eat plenty of Cuban food in several Miami-greasy-spoon type restaurants so I may be a bit spoiled. Whatever the case, I would definitely go back and encourage anyone looking for a nice, casual Cuban dining experience to checkout 90 Miles.. perfect for the first timer AND it's BYOB.. always a plus in my book!
