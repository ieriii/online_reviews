Sometimes you wonder if it's the people you are with or just you. I'm starting to think I'm not a downtown night life scene type of person. I didn't really care for this lounge, with the exception of the decor. It's a very sexy place - the art and photos exemplify that. The music is house if you like that, you could probably appreciate the place a little more. It's an upscale older crowd - not the same crowd as the people that frequent the bars in Wrigleyville, that's for sure! I would venture to say 30 year olds and up. It's a very posh place, and it just seemed like people are pretentious and fake. I look for genuine smiles and people looking like they are having a good time, and just didn't feel convinced. One guy ended up elbowing my friend and caused her to spill her drink and didn't even apologize. He was snobby about it when she called him out on it. I don't understand if the place is a lounge why dancers are there, because I think the point of having them is to encourage other people to dance too.  I think lounges are meant for people to chill, hang out and drink. I'd be hard pressed to go again.
