Damn, what a good find. I've got some super cool friends and for my bday lunch Miss Eugenia O. let me pick the place. Having heard of Sushi X's crab rangoon roll, we had a winner. We walked in on a Tuesday and the place was dead. After drooling over their menu we wondered why. After checking out the $10 lunch special we decided people must be batshit crazy. That, or they have no idea of the awesomeness that exits in this little black box of a place on Chicago. On to the important stuff. Their rolls are huge. Got that? Huge. If you're a size queen, then this is your place. We went with the crab rangoon, honey, and sushifruit rolls. Damn good. The crab rangoon roll was heaven, the honey was tasty (we switched out the tuna w/ salmon - with no problem, I might add), and the sushifruit was simply amazing, with the fruit accenting and giving a unique kick to the sushi, instead of becoming a full on fruity dessert roll. They also offer various dipping sauces...um, honey sesame mayo anyone? Yum. The service was quick and friendly, and they always have rotating artwork on the walls to enjoy/purchase. We returned a couple weeks later for some takeout, and surprise! You can grab the lunch special to go. Score. My stuffed takeout bag came with miso soup, a roll, salad, and a pop. All for $10. And when it comes to the rolls, they don't crap out on the selection - they give you an amazing choice of 12 rolls, including their delish honey roll. Oh, and from placing our order to getting our stuff we made it out in less than ten minutes. Yes, I think I'm obsessed.
