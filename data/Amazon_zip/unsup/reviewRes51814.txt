The service here was awful. We came in around 3pm on a Monday, put in our order at 3:15. We got the Caesar Salad and Supreme Chicago Style Pizza. The salad came out at 3:30. At 4:15 our server introduced us to another server that would be taking over our table (I believe our first server's shift had ended). We asked when the pizza would be out and he said the order had not been put it yet. So he put it in. At 4:45 we asked when should we be expecting our pizza. Sure enough, he told us he had forgotten to put it the order. We finally got our pizza around 5:15. I would have been way more upset if the pizza wasn't so delicious. Great pizza here. They just need to get a little bit more organized.
