I love this place at lunchtime in the summer, when you can sit outside. The salad and bread are excellent and fresh, and you can split any one of the pasta dishes with someone and walk away full, happy, and not broke. I almost always get the chicken & eggplant tortellini with a fresh, simple marinara sauce. Lately I've been loving on the gnocchi in porcini mushroom sauce. Imagine pillowy gnocchi melting in your mouth in a rich dark mushroom sauce. Dinner time can be quite crowded - I wouldn't recommend it as a date place on the weekends, since they pack you in. Servers are friendly and knowledgeable.
