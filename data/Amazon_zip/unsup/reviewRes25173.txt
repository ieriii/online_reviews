Having never eaten costa riccan food before I had very little expectations for my first experience at Irazu and fortunately the food and service far surpassed my expectations. We started with the patacones - double fried green plantains slathered in garlic sauce. The plantains were a bit on the bland side - wished there was more of a kick, but I was still hopeful that my main dish would make up for the slow beginning. I went with the vegetarian burrito with sauteed zucchinis - so flavorful, avovado was fresh, the beans and yellow rice added so much to what appeared to be a very simple burrito. My friend had the pepito sandwich which was filled with a rich, tender, and flavorable beef. We ended the meal with the highly reccommended oatmeal shake. It tasted like a snickerdoodle in a cup...very delicious. The place is great for a large group or an intimate date and you get great food for wonderful prices. Not to be missed.
