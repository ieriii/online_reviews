Holy hell, I love this place. As a vegetarian, I can only speak to those options on the menu but the potato tacos are fanfreakingtastic. They also serve them with a shredded salad with some sort of real strong white wine vingear on top (and beets -- I looove beets). The salad is about my second favorite part of the meal. The rice is good, the beans are good... it's more comfort foody than mexican food. Not sure how else to explain it. It's different in a comfortable way? I skipped the oatmeal shake once and it was a big mistake. I ordered delivery once when I was sick. I called to order and the guy that took my order said, "Oh, you sound terrible." I said that I had a cold and, when my food came, someone had written "Feel better soon, honey!" on my take out box. How cute is that. I'll forever be a fan of this place.
