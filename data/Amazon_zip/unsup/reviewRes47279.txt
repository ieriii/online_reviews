This place is a trip. Burgers which are very "guilty" at a small bar-grill that is filled with heavy metal rock and some sort of gathering of monster costume people watching over you above (you'll just have to go and see). Their burgers were pretty inventive, from an elvis version with bacon and peanut butter to a carnivore lovers with carne and prosciutto. At first it felt overwhelming for a person who is not much of a burger fan to begin with. When I think of burger fans, I think of men. Call me assumptive, call me sexist. But do know at around 1 that this place was 99% men, with the 1% of females being me and my friend. Burgers were made perfectly, all dolled up in a buttery pretzel roll. $1.50 can of PBR on the side. Although we started out our arrival starving, half a plate later we could not eat another bite. This place is a trip were taking!
