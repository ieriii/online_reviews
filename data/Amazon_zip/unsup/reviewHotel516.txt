I was offered a free room for a night by someone who could not use it so who am I to say no to a free suite just 2 blocks from my office?!? I got there just a few minutes before the cocktail hour was ending so I had time to get a drink, go upstairs to my room and go back down for 1 more before they closed for the night. Cocktail hour(s) also includes some goodies to snack on. The suite I had was okay, it looked out at the Sheridan and NBC Towers. The sitting room had a chair and couch that were not all that comfortable and seemed old to me. The bed was really comfy but I can't stand feather pillows so fortunately there were about 20 pillows on the bed. The bathroom was an average size, towels were thick but not soft or large and the shower itself was pretty big. Breakfast is really good. There is everything from made to order omelets to a hot buffet consisting of eggs, pancakes, sausage, bacon, potatoes but also the cold stuff like bagels, cereal, yogurt, donuts, muffins, etc. The lobby is really quite big seeing that they have 2 events for guests that require use of the lobby, plenty of tables, chairs, and couches but seemed "cold". I did not get a chance to use the fitness room or indoor pool (which is actually quite small). Overall, I could not beat the price!
