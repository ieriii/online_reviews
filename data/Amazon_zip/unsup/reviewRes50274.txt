I'm from San Diego so this was my first visit to Chicago and let me say that it was AWESOME! Everyone there was very friendly and the city is amazing. We stayed downtown at the Seneca Hotel. Of course we caught 2 Cubs game at Wrigley, which is an awesome stadium. My buddies brother lives out in Chicago and showed us this bar. We stayed there till it closed but the manager Eddie let us stay and drink even though the place was closed. He showed us around the bar and talked about all the famous celebrities and sports figures that have been there before. He even bought us shots! The staff there is really nice. They even took us to another bar after hours and drank more there with them. If you're in Chicago DEFINITELY check out this bar. It won't disappoint....Cheers!
