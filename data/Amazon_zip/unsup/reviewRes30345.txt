Their fake reuben is better than any real reuben I've had. And their miso french onion soup is absolutely fantastic. The only thing I have ordered and didn't care for so far was the "Eggz Benedict" with scrambled tofu in place of the free range eggs. I am sort of glad it takes me thirty minutes and a train transfer to get to the Chicago Diner, or I would probably eat here five times a week and grow round.
