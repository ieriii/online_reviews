I definitely think Graham Elliot is worth a trip for those that like food and are willing to pay for it... However, at my dinner experience last night (with a large group ) there were definitely a few misses. First, while the service was pleasant and attentive, I found some of it a bit overbearing. We were constantly being told "chef this, chef that...this is where the chef's creativity really shines, blah, blah, blah". It definitely got old after a while. Let the food speak for itself. Also, while my starter (spring onion bisque) and dessert (lemon cake with blueberry gelato) were great, the main course (skate wing confit) failed to impress. The flavor of orange was overpowering and didn't let the fish shine. Would definitely consider going back, but probably just for cocktails (which were delicious) and a snack or two at the bar.
