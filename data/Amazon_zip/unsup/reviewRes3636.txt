Best chicken you will ever get in Chitown I was initially skeptical, but my friend and I went this place. I ordered half sassy flavored and half Korean BBQ.. OMG, It is soooo goood. Sassy flavored chicken's skin is very crispy, yet the meat is very tender and juicy!. The Korean BBQ, on the other hand, i just plain good!! I would prefer people to try 5 pieces of wings instead of getting traditional chickens
