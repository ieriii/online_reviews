I have been to every churrascaria in the Chicago-land area and this is my absolute favorite! It is a little bit more expensive than the other churrascarias in Chicago but the meat is much tastier and the salad bar is better as well! If you go you have to try and parmesan pork it is out of this world! I have been to Fogo De Chao at least ten times and every time I am greeted by friendly servers and great service. I take all of my out of town guests here and it impresses them every time. Last time I visited I was clumsy and spilt a glass of wine. The hostess quickly grabbed me a shout on the go wash cloth and some club soda. I would watch out for the alcohol and sodas they are very overpriced.
