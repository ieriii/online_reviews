If you haven't tried out this Lettuce Entertain You restaurant you need to stop in. They have an amazing salad bar. It always looks really fresh and includes a ton of different items including fruit, pasta salad, soup, and you definitely have to try the cream cheese with chocolate chips, probably the best thing on there. : ) If you are going to get an appetizer I highly recommend the buffalo nachos. They are so good!! They also have really good burgers. Personally I stay away from the fries but they have really good home-made chips that come with each dish. Save room for the desert the cinnamon oblivion (huge cinnamon cookie warmed and topped with ice cream, carmel, and whipped cream--don't forget the cherry) is a must have. I could probably go on about this place for another hour, but I will let you check it out yourself.
