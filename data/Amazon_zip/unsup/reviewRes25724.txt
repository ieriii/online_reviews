One of my favorite restaurants in Chicago... and I am a Native foodie!! Every single dish I've had is like a dream. And I've had EVERY ONE POSSIBLE for a vegetarian! I've sent friends there! I've had many business lunches there and every single person has thanked me for the referral!  I could go on-and-on but I would just ramble the same point over and over... It is fabulous!!
