I am writing this only because I don't want to see Zed in Chicago closes like their sister in Florida. We have visited Zed over 12 times in the past 3 years, but it seems that they think gradually lowering the "real" variety of their food will remain unnoticed. Sadly my visits have become less frequent due to their cost cutting measures. In my last visit in January, they had substituted most of their interesting items with standard boring choices that you can find in any cheaper restaurant too. Here are some examples: 1-Their salad bar has always had repetitive plates, so even though you see perhaps 20 plates, there are only around 8 unique plates. But in my last visit I could not see a single interesting ingredient in their salad bar, no fennel, no endive, no watercress, nothing but potato salad,noodle, lettuce, ...really? When you pay $48 you expect to see at least some fancy ingredients that cost more than 99 cents /lb and not just potato, and noodles mixed in 10 different ways. 2-In the cheese section, they always have the same type of above average cheese, again @ $49, it would be nice to have higher end cheeses too, I give you a hint, how about Goat cheese? 3-In the seafood sector, the crab cake which was a big reason I loved Zed was gone 4-I am a meat person and by meat I mean meat (Beef, Lamb, Venison,...), not Chicken or Bacon. If I want bacon I can find it in any Holiday Inn Express free breakfast buffet. There is no lamb chops offered here unlike Fogo,TdB, the leg of lamb if offered has never been that good and the quality of beef meat in my opinion is not comparable to Fogo or TdB. Some cuts contain more fat than meat and the butter that they rub on meat skewers just ruins the good taste of meat. 5-In the fruit department, instead of blueberries, raspberries,...they had grapes and nothing else. All these said, I still like to see this place earns its number 1 place back from Fogo in my list. The place that it kept for over 2 years.
