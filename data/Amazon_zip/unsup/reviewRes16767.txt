Where do I even begin? The best place in the city to get amazing, tasty, well mixed, extremely rare cocktails (starting $12 and up) but definitely worth the price. Plus, they aren't stingy on the amount they pour, great portions. This is just a place you have to experience for yourself. Writing a brief Yelp review doesn't do it justice. The decor is absolutely amazing, totally intimate and PERFECT for a first date (keep in mind they only sell snacks, not entire entrees). It has a crazy romantic feel, and the servers are friendly and really knowledgeable about the drink menu. I would go here every Friday night if I could. The drinks are THAT good and the ambience is just ... one of kind. Definitely my new go-to spot for a loungy, relaxed, night out with my hubby or girlfriends. It's kind of funny how people miss the place. Meaning that you can't detect the entry door from outside because a huge mural is painted on the outside of the building that extends over the entire venue. There's usually a really well-dressed Black guy that serves as the host, and tells people about seating availablity and wait time. I only noticed the entry because there were groups standing outside waiting, meanwhile countless people walked right by it asking "where the hell is the Violet Room?" Totally VIP-esque, cozy, romantic ... amazing.
