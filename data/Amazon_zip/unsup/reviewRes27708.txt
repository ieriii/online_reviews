The BEST mexican food in all of Chicago. Probably in all of Illinois. I did some investigating into their catering prices (got that wedding coming up soon) and they charge $6 a person for a total of three large entrees......per person!?! What?! How fricken awesome is that? So....now ya know. If you're planning a wedding and you love Mexican food....Nuevo Leon is the place to call. Ha-cha!
