This place is outstanding! I've only tried the wings but I've been VERY pleased every time. John who runs the place is about as helpful as they come. Incredibly knowledgeable and pointed us in the right direction on our first visit. I've been back once since and was able to try a few more sauces. The people claiming the wings at Crisp aren't that great probably eat wings at BW3!! (weak) When it comes to wings Crisp has a style all their own and they do it to perfection. If you haven't been yet, you need to.
