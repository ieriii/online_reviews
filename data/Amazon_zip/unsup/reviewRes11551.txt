Wandering through Wicker Park in search of lunch, good thing I have my trusty Blackberry Yelp app. nearby restaurants.. searching....... Top of the list..Bongo Room! I had been wanting to come here forever, and would have forgotten it was in the area, thanks Yelp App! This really is a fantastic place, the service is prompt and friendly and the menu is a variety of new takes on old brunch and lunch standards. I went with the special omelet, beef tenderloin, spinach, portabellos, and aged white cheddar. I rarely eat beef but this sounded so good, and I am glad I did. It was a fantastic combination of savory flavors and textures that was perfect for this cold January day. I also asked for it to be just a bit soft and unlike most places I have been they cooked it perfectly. The potatoes were dilly, crispy, and perfect as well. I also really appreciate the fact that they didn't mind that we sat there for a good hour after we were done knitting, in fact they were even interested in what we were doing. I wouldn't have done this had there been people waiting but it was 2pm on a Tuesday so it was fairly quiet. I don't think I would come back here on a weekend though, I have been told about the epic waits and there is NOWHERE to stand. That being said Bongo Room is definitely the prefect spot for a midweek brunch next time I am in the neighborhood.
