I love this concept. Upscale BBQ in a place with great southern charm. They really nailed the ambiance, and I would give it 4 stars in that aspect for sure. As for the food... Bottom line: the meat is super high quality (we had pulled pork and baby back ribs). It falls off the bone, is super tender, and you can just tell it's great product. However, it really isn't seasoned. Now, this is fine, since it's good meat and all, but in that case I need damn good sauces. Unfortunately Chicago Q failed to deliver in the sauce area. Their "hot" one wasn't hot, the regular one tasted bottled, and the vinegar one was so thin you could barely get it to stick to your meat. Such a killer, cause they give you HUGE portions, and the whole time I was just thinking, good thing I'll have left overs so I can put Smoke Daddy sauce on it at home. As for the sides and such, the wings were really good, albeit pretty fatty. The savory hush puppies were very dense, but good. Mac & cheese were both good but didn't stand out from the competition. In all reality, the most standout side was the fries, which were perfectly fried and seasoned. Also, the chips they put on the table in place of bread are fabulous. Oh, and the milk and cookies are good, but we were too full to truly enjoy them.
