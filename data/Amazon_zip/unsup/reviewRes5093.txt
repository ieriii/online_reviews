I was originally turned off by this place because the restaurants tag line is "cheese, swine & wine". Don't get me wrong, I'm a HUGE cheese and wine fan, but prefer to not eat pork. After months of hesitating about going in, a friend and I decided to finally check it. Upon entry the staff was all smiles and very friendly. I could tell it gets pretty crowded pretty quickly (the entire place probably only holds approximately 50 people) and was pleased I decided to get there at 5pm with my friend arriving shortly after. I initially noticed the wide mouth wine glasses on the table (it's the small things that make me happy) and got very excited. While waiting on my friend to arrive, I perused the wine list and was happy to see there are no American wines on the list. I've gotten into the habit of drinking mostly American wine and wanted to expand my palate and here was my chance. Also, I was glad to see this is a small plate restaurant which I absolutely love. After my friend arrived, we settled on a 2007 bottle of Cotes du Rhone blend, Les Abeilles - from France of course ($40) and we were very pleased. We decided to order the hazelnut salad, whipped feta smear and a medley of cheeses (camembert, truffle tremor and prairie breeze). Everything was amazingly good. I was in cheese and wine heaven. Our entire bill was $74. The waitress was so helpful and pleasant - she made me feel like a valued guest. I plan to visit TPP more frequently and experience more of their extensive wine and food selections.
