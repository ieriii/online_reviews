I come here every time I'm in Chicago and I crave it when I'm away! I've had several of the crepes and I liked them all. I think the dessert crepes are good, but the savory crepes are really the show stoppers. Try the marrakech or the iberico crepe and definitely add the merguez (if you eat lamb). Order a turkish coffee with your meal. And enjoy all the extras that make this place great - the cucumber in the water, the delicious sweet potato soup to start your meal, and the yummy hot sauce that is good on everything (except maybe the dessert crepes).
