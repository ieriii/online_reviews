It is hard to gather the words to.describe the hot dogs here. With a variety ranging from Fois Gras to rattlesnake, it is easily one of the more interesting restaurants one been to. Granted that I had to wait more then 2 hours to get a taste of their well known dogs, I would have to say it is something to have to come to at least once in your lifetime. Luckily, I came with a group so hat we were able to taste a number of them. (Because to be frank, I don't know if I'd want to stand in this line again.) - fois gras and sauternes duck sausage: a must! It's my favorite dog here. There was a certain degree of flavor that permeated through each bite. For only $9, it's quite the deal if you ask me.  - the special of the day: lamb & beef gyro sausage: This was one of the top 3 ones I've tried. I'm a huge fan of gyros so I absolutely loved this one.  - smoked yak sausage (with bacon-garlic mayonnaise and smoked gouda cheese): one of my favorites. It was very flavorful and the gouda was just icing. - bacon sausage: i thought this one was not as flavorful as the others and the creme was overwhelming. - reg chicago hotdog: it was good but lacked the taste explosion as some of the other gourmet ones. There were toppings that made it taste fresh but it was difficult to taste all the toppings in each bite. They simply overwhelmed it. -duck fat fries: a must! Unforunately, they only sell these on certain days (Fri & Sat), so get them if you happen to be there on the days they are served.  The line is ridicously long and tables are first come first serve. It's not the most ideal restaurant arrangement, but it's definitely worth giving it a try. I hear it's only an hour wait if you stand in line at 11am. The rule here is "the earlier the better."
