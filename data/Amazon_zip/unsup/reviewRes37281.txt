Little expensive for a cafeteria style place, but given the dearth of easy options nearby, Fox & Obel Cafe is great. Only been here once, but I plan to be back! The angus burger was quality stuff...little slow to come out (back hot kitchen?), but was excellent and the fries that accompanied it were good too. The side of truffled frites which I did not order - if they come with the aoli sauce in my buddy's roast beef sandwich should be great too. Lots of sandwich options baked on fresh, scrumptious breads from the market next door, as well as a few hot items and some desserts. I'll prob try the salmon burger next. As mentioned by other yelpers, there is free valet parking, so stop on by! Just remember that kitchen closes at 9p so get your order in by then. Oh, and if you eat in, you'll have to put up with a earthquake-worthy rumbling below your bowels...not sure what it is, but it sounded like some sort of generator.
