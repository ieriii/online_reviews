I like Piece a lot despite a few qualms. I find that the atmosphere kind of blows, quite honestly, and the seating is uncomfortable. Try to come here on a Saturday night and you'll see taxi cabs dropping off carloads of ladies in high-heeled tall boots and ball-cap wearing dudes. You will wait for hours. You will experience rage. But hit this place up early on a weeknight like the geriatric curmudgeon that you are and you'll be treated to delightful pizza and beer. I say with only slight hesitation that this is my favorite pizza in the city. I wish the pizza cooks would claim victory over the pizza's tendency to flop/sog/weep at the ends but the sauce is freaking delicious and the crust is crispy and chewy and yum. The Worryin' Ale and Golden Arm are perfect foils for mouthfuls of greasy cheese, and the mixed green salad is fresh 'n tasty. In sum, I like going here for pizza but not so much to hang. If you can get a booth, you're better for it. Otherwise go early, take out or just endure.
