Came here with BF a couple of weeks ago for dinner on a Saturday night. It was around 7 or 8, so I was pleased when they could seat us on the patio right away. Score! As soon as we got our menus, I began scouring the wine list for Nebbiolo, as I had just returned from a jaunt to Italy, where I was introduced to the beautiful aforementioned grape. Double score, they had several options, including by the glass! As for the food, BF enjoys forcing me to eat beets (although I almost always enjoy them) so we got the beets with whipped goat cheese and pistachio "vinaigrette". A-MAZ-ING. I could have eaten approximately 15 more bowls of that delicious love. Secondly, we ate the calimari. This turned out to be a chilled salad with perhaps... toasted... israeli... couscous? Who knows, something was in there that was israeli couscous-esque. It was so delicious, the calimari was so tender! Also could have eaten 15 bowls of that. Our third thing was a bruschetta type thing with serrano ham and an eNORmous fried egg on top. Goose egg maybe? It was huge. This one was a bit disappointing... unwieldy to eat, very messy. Though tasty, this was my least favorite "tapa". Fourth and finally was the milk braised pork shoulder. This thing was crazy good. The meat was SO tender, simply falling apart. I literally ate it with a spoon. No really, LITERALLY. The waiter had taken my fork when he cleared the last plates. It was that tender, it was spoonable. The mashed taters that it came with were pretty boss also. If only we came to the mag-mile area more often! This place is mega yummy.
