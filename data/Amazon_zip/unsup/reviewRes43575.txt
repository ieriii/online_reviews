Good strong coffee and reasonable prices for brunch. Abbreviated menu (for brunch) but the sandwiches sounded better - I may have to check this place out for lunch! I would recommend the Huevos Rancheros (only on the weekends) but you should be prepared they are pretty heavy handed with the black beans. The side of sauce is what made this dish in my opinion. All together it was very flavorful. Breakfast panini was ok but nothing really special - not as much flavor but I guess I should not have expected that much from a bacon/egg/cheese sandwich.  Overall, I thought the place was pretty okay (sorry, I don't think it lived up to all the hype) and a recommendation would be to get the coffee to-go. I revel in that first cup of coffee after a late night out and waiting the 30 minutes to get seated for my coffee was making me antsy.
