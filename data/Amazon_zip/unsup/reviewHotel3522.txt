Great hotel. Great location. Conveniently located on the Magnificent Mile. Walking distance to buses/trains, shops, and restaurants.  Clean and nicely decorated room. Had an iMAC in our room.. Super awesome! Free Wifi in the room for your own laptop and mobile devices. Sky Lounge on the top floor: Serves breakfast from 6am to 10:30am. Friendly staff. Great view of the city. Unfortunately, it was rainy when we were there. No matter...
