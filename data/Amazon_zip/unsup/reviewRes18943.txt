The good - pate board and fabulous roasted fennel soup. Wine and beer selection also. The ok - tomato risotto with cheese and asparagus. Perfectly cooked which is tough to do in a commercial kitchen, but the taste reminded me of Campbell's tomato soup, not bad just not good. The bad - service was glacially slow, not a leisurely paced, but slow. Sloooooooooow! turtle like, "we forgot you were here" slow.
