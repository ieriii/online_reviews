This place is amazing. My husband and I discovered this small little BOYB spot many months ago. I've had a many date night dinners here as well as birthday party dinners. Service is always attentive and quick.  The rolls are the best in the city. Creative, generously portioned, unique, AMAZING. The crab rangoon roll is heaven along with the honey roll. This is a great spot for a casual dinner with your significant other and as well as a fun spot for friends to gather.  My husband and I have tried numerous sushi spots in Chicago and this is by far the best!! You're missing out if you have not been here!
