I've been coming here since I was a kid, and it's still my first (and usually only) choice for Mexican food, anywhere. This is the only place where I eat flour tortillas (they're made in house, though the corn tortillas are still great and come from Tortilleria Sabinas next door). The Carne Asada is my favorite, either as tacos or as an entree. My next favorite is Enchiladas de Pollo with the absolutely perfect mole. My pescatarian sister always gets the Camarones en Mojo de Ajo, and she's never disappointed. For appetizers, I recommend the Queso Panela, absolutely delicious, and the Quesadillas Raul. Their flan is smooth with lots of cinnamon, a nice change from the usual flan de leche. In the winter, their hot chocolate is a great dessert in itself. They also make the best horchata I've had anywhere.
