Old-time standard. Eat in family atmosphere- known for celebratory dinners. Delivery always on time.  Pizza is awesome. Dinners such as pasta are good too. Estimate in the past 5 yrs I have gotten 6-7 of the free pizzas for the 20 coupons! It is that good. Moved away and miss LaVilla almost as much as I miss Pete's 2.
