Did the Wednesday Date Night deal. Had dinner reservations on the main floor. The staff is generally nice and accommodating. It is cramp quarters inside, picture eating in a cabana themed mess hall cafeteria. The food is good with unexpected flavor enhancements like lavendar scent, but ive definitely had better. Dont know if ill be back again to try other food options but I got a good sampling from the date night menu which included pho, spring rolls, mushroom & tofu and bbq pork & vermicelli -pedestrian faire and hard to find french influence? Layout is poor or maybe it was just really crowded Service is great Flavor is exceptional Price is expensive
