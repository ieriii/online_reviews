The bartender told me to write a bad review on Yelp so here it is. This bartender had the worst attitude ever. If Al Capone was still around and heard how he spoke to his customers, this bartender would be in the direction of Jimma Hoffa (AKA disappear from the face of the earth). All me and my girlfriend wanted to do was take a picture and the first thing he said was You're not even buying anything. He had not even given us a chance to order a drink before opening his big mouth. If this place keeps a bartender like this and chases its customers away in an economy like we have today, Green Mill will be closed before we know it. Only one can hope so we can save ourselves from such a nonsense business. Basically, people need to find a much better place to go. The bartenders who work here have an attitude problem. The first time we went here the bartender acted like he had a stick up his rear. They just have no personalities. I've heard numerous stories of Green Mill treating their customers badly. They must not be aware of our economic recession and how many places we've taken for granted over the years are gone forever. Surely, Green Mill does not think they are immune from this economic recession. A steady loss of business and they'll be out of business. Only one can hope that will happen sooner than later.Seriously, these people need to get out of Chicago because they are putting a blight on my city. Somebody needs to notify the musicians who play here and tell them how they treat their customers...the musicians will find another gig in Chicago with the snap of a finger.Lastly, dear rude bartender. I hope you learned your lesson. If I ever see you again at Green Mill, I will call a police officer to escort you away for making threats of a criminal nature. We'll see how jail treats you.
