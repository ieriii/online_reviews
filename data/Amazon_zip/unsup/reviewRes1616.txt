I heart Hot Doug's and if I could I would marry it. While visiting Chicago, my friend took me here on a Friday to sample the hot dogs and duck fat fries. Although he claims Portillo's is a better hot dog (I disagree), we can both agree that it's clear Doug has a passion for great sausage and really cares about his customers. We ordered: Jalapeno and bacon duck sausage with blood orange mustard - duck sausage was out of this world, although the blue cheese was a bit overpowering Corned beef sausage with chicken liver mousse and horseradish mustard topped with shredded swiss - the chicken liver mousse really made the corned beef hot dog amazing The Dog grilled with everything on it - very tasty version of the classic Chicago style dog Duck fries (only Fri/Sat) - crispy, savory, and perfectly salty. duck fat fries will not taste like duck, but being fried in duck fat seems to make the fries crispy without being soggy or mealy (I really love well fried fries) The wait will be out the door, the line will move (relatively) quickly, and you will not be disappointed. Next time I'll try to catch the infamous Foie gras hot dog!
