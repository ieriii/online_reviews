I read many reviews before deciding to visit Grahm Elliot last weekend with my wife but wanted to try something a little different. I always enjoy new flavors and was pleased by most of the combinations. I can honestly say " the corn soup is AMAZING!". ....... .........I never thought I would write such words!!! First, I did not find the music to be too loud, the patrons were much louder. The bartenders were very nice courteous and helpful to questions. The waiters spoke too quickly and very rehearsed. The restaurant felt understaffed and you waited for service then the food abruptly was presented and off they went.. The food was very original, high quality and many flavors were presented.... a true test of culinary creativity. Some of the combinations tried a little too hard, that does not bother me. GE is stepping out of the box in many ways with his food creations and with that there will be many successes and some flops...... time will be the judge of that! I am torn on the overall star rating.... Quality 4 stars Creativity 5 stars Service 2-3 stars Atmosphere 3 stars This one is a coin toss if I will go back! I really love new and daring flavor combinations!
