The atmosphere is better at Ras Dashen... but the food here is just as good and a fraction of the cost. I ventured out to Ras Dashen (because of the amazing reviews, even though it's a trek for my Roscoe Village ass), and it was great... but it's just as good as Demera. I haven't tried Ethiopian Diamond, and am unlikely to unless Demera somehow disappoints me someday. The salmon rules, and the standards are great. If you're a lamb fan this may be the only thing I don't recommend here, since I think it's boiled (I hate the texture). Luckily that means you can make room for more yummy vegetarian dishes and kitfo!
