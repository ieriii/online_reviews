If waiting in line for an hour, solely to be rewarded with a luke warm and bland egg dish smothered in even colder and congealing cheese is your idea of a fab meal, then this place is for you!! Yolk on Michigan Avenue is obviously benefiting greatly from three things: (1) its location across from the rather heavily trafficked Grant Park; (2) its proximity to a number of hotels with hungry tourists; and (3) the fact that there are very few brunch spot competitors in the S. Loop. So, yeah, Boooo, Yolk!!
