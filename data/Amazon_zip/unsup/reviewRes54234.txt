Love the outdoor seating except for the fact that my friend and I were sitting right under the music speaker. We asked them to turn the music down, and they did so w/ attitude. After about 10 min, the music was up to full volume. Sort of annoying....On the flip side, the food was great. We both got the shrimp platters. Food was fresh and very tasty. We got the guac for an app. It was just OK. It did not have that much flavor and the consistency was off, like I'm pretty sure the used mayo. Cheap Cheap Trick, Irazu!
