While visiting Chicago I came here with two friends. While we were waiting for our beer ($17 pitcher of Worryin' Ale) and pizza ($16 med 1/2 pepperoni, 1/2 artichoke and spinach) one of my friends said if I ever opened a restaurant I think I would want it to be like this. I think that sums up the casual, energetic and fun atmosphere at Piece. I always respect a restaurant that also brews it's own beer. I would definitely come here again, and if they ever open an outpost in NYC, I'll be first in line.
