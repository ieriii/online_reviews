Uncommon Ground is a nice and spacious place with a laid back atmosphere. Love the burgers, chicken sandwich, sweet potato fries, rhubarb crisp is outstanding and the hot liquor drinks are de-lish! They have a parking lot, which makes it very convenient. I've been to Uncommon Ground 3-4 times and the food is always consistent. The lay out of the restaurant is great and its a relaxing place for mid-size groups. When the place gets packed the service suffers a bit, so arrive early for dinner. But all in all, the food is good and reasonably priced... a wonderful place for lunch and dinner with friends. Almost forgot... on Mondays selected bottles of wine are 1/2 price and they're tasty too!
