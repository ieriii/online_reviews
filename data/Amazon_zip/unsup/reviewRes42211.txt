The food here is absolutely delicious, albeit a tad heavy. -ham and cheese fondue: If you love cheese, this is definitely the dish! -mushroom & truffle pasta: Amazinggg with great texture as well. -pork belly: Very good. -truffle fries: good. I love the ambiance as well, but the one star off is for our service, who was unnecessarily rude, making smart jokes that were more offensive than funny. at least he finally realized we were not happy with his service, so he began sending another waiter over to bring us the food. However, overall, I would definitely recommend this place! I'm still craving the food :P
