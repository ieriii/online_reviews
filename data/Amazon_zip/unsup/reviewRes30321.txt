We usually go there an hour before closing and there's no wait at that time. (We are European, eating at 9:30pm is no problem.) The food is great, and we prefer to order a few things from the appetizer menu, so you get to taste more different things. Cocktails are awesome, the tamarind margarita in particular (with a chili pepper rim - great touch for the hot food lovers like us). If you can, try to get a table in the right part of the restaurant, it is cuter and less diner-y. The SO had a few things he was not all that happy about, hence the 4 stars (in place of 5).
