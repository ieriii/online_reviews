Rarely do you find a place that does not one but two things very well. Indie Cafe has great Sushi and great Thai. I love their Pad Thai and Bay Beach Fried Rice. Just a great place to go for carry out or dine in. Their staff is friendly and attentive. I hope you enjoy their unique collection of art. Check it out sometime.
