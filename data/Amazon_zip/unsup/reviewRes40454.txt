After reading the reviews here, I had to check it out of course. Just got back(!) from the restaurant at 1132 N Ashland. I was expecting the place to look more dumpy, but it's not bad at all. I didn't care much for the service and it didn't care about me. The tacos, horchata, and salsa are REALLY good (one star for each of those), but that might be about it. The chile rellenos was kinda okay. The chips are a bit hard. The super burrito was not too super. It's big... My eyes bulged when it came out and I started to feel a little giddy - I mean, this thing was nearly a foot long and 3.5 inches wide! Where do you get tortillas that big?! Then you quickly realize... it's not rolled up tight... it's MOSTLY lettuce and cheese... all of the sour cream and rice was on one side... NOT at all like the makes-my-mouth-water picture they have posted above the register. I'd go back for the tacos (take-out), but I think I'll try the one right next door too.
