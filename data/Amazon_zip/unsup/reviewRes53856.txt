I was so excited to check out Purple Pig after hearing some great things... I'd heard some bad things too, but discounted them since the restaurant was relatively new at the time and working through 'growing pains' at that point (I thought)... I decided to reserve judgment and didn't head there until it had been open almost a year. When we arrived for our 8:30 reservation, we were told the wait would be at least 40 minutes. I don't mind waiting for a table (up to 2 hours) when I don't have a reservation. However, when I have a reservation, I don't expect to show up on time and wait for 40 minutes. What's worse is that our table was not actually ready in 40 minutes, but closer to 70. There was no accommodation made by the wait staff or management after such a long wait (and several 'check-ins' regarding time) such as a round of drinks, apps, etc. Furthermore, the staff was exceptionally snotty and rude, making our entire dining experience completely distasteful and atrocious. The food was actually quite good, but the entire experience was so clouded by the rude staff, I would never recommend this restaurant to anyone.
