So to begin, my friends told me to meet them there at 10am. I thought, "Hot dogs at 10 am? Yuck." But I knew that this place has a line so I figured maybe we would have to wait 2 hours or something. Well, they open at 10:30 am and one of our friends got there at 9:30 to be the first person in the line. An hour later the line was a block long and the people at the end surely would wait another hour before they ordered. So, we did eat our sausages at 10:30am.  Anyways, the menu changes daily. They have a list of their basic sausages which you can get anytime with the typical Chicago hot dog style condiments. Then their specialty items vary every day. We got the following: Cheese-Stuffed Chicken Chorizo with Mole a la Carlos and Queso Asadero; The Brigitte Bardot- Andouille Sausage: Mighty, mighty, mighty hot!; The Mountain Man Sausage (a damn tasty combination of Elk, Antelope, Buffalo, Venison and Caribou) with Roasted Yellow Pepper Mayonnaise and Tetilla Cheese and duck fat fries. Surprisingly, the Mountain Man was my favorite. The meat was good, not like shady hot dog meat. The Chicken Chorizo was also good. The Andouille Sausage, one of the regular sausages, was not very good, and not spicy either. I really enjoyed the other two. Their concept is that you can take three distinct ingredients and flavors and put them together in interesting, delicious combinations. The fries were ok, nothing too exciting.  Despite how much it seemed like we ate, and the random assortment, it was less than totally satisfying, although the flavors were yummy. I would say that this was a fun place to try, but I wouldn't necessarily go back, unless I wanted to wait in line for an hour to eat sausage at 10:30am.
