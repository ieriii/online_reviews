Cafe 28 is a colorful, cute date spot. We went for Sunday brunch and there wasn't a wait. We ordered the Southwest eggs benedict, cubano, and a blueberry pancake. I love the fact that they'll let you order any single pancake! I'm more into the savory stuff, but the pancake was my favorite. It was fluffy & chewy. The cubano was pretty tasty, but my eggs benedict were just ok. It looked better than it tasted. There wasn't enough hollandaise sauce on top and the potatoes were mushy. I probably should have ordered the breakfast burrito. This place is a breath of fresh air to typical brunch dining. As for dinner- I've tried the pork chops and they are not to be missed!
