It is awesome. Go there. We arrived at 6:30pm on their second day and the wait was about twenty minutes. That's twenty minutes of watching Rick Bayless do his kitchen-thang five feet away and thinking about asking him for a picture. By the time we were done around 8pm, the line was out the door. Started out with guacamole and chips, which were decent but not mind-blowing. Then the torta ahogada arrived -- and it was ridiculous. Mexican-style French-dip-like awesomeness with tender carnitas and spicy tomato salsa-broth. Had a few bites of the torta milanesa, which was delicious. Kind of like a panini with crispy chicken and melted cheese. The spicy seafood caldo was packed with shrimp and mussels, very solid. Very good food. There is one thing -- it's kind of expensive for an order-at-the-counter place. Dinner for two (with a couple beers... and we ordered a lot) ended up costing almost $60 including tip. Kind of weird getting packed in with strangers due to limited seating. Cool place though, busy but still great service. Rick Bayless was very involved and welcoming, personally answering questions about the menu and taking pictures with fans. We'll be back.
