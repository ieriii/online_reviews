I know this isn't "authentic" Korean food, and I understand some may find it simple...but that's what I love about Crisp. Amazingly flavorful chilled vegetable side dishes, perfectly cooked rice, and the tastiest chicken around. I HIGHLY recommend the Seoul Sassy sauce.  The chicken is always cooked to a golden-brown perfection and the sprinkles of green onion on top are perfect. I had a Buddha Bowl last time and was so satisfied. Dining in was a bit awkward I'll admit, I'm not a fan of cafeteria-style seating at large tables, especially when the strangers across from you are silent and therefore are hearing your entire conversation. But whatever. For the record I do think they were a bit more generous with the vegetable side dish portions when we dined in as opposed to when we order out...
