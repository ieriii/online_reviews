This was the most incredibly awful ordering experience I have ever encountered. I have ordered from Fogo in the past and have always been a huge fan of their food. I have never ordered for delivery before this experience and I can assure you that I never will again. In fact, I don't know if I would even consider going back here even if I were picking the food up myself because the service was just so unacceptable. My food took two hours after I called once to ask where it was, I was given the excuse that they did not receive my order until 20 minutes after I placed it. I don't really see how this is an acceptable excuse. I think I was in such shock by this response that I didn't even address that issue. I only said, will the food be hot when it arrives and how much longer. She said with a bad attitude, yeah it will be hot and it should be there in 10 minutes. Fast forward 40 minutes later and the food showed up (after I contacted grub hub to see if they could get a better ETA), no apology and freezing cold. At this point, I tried calling the restaurant but it was 10pm (I placed my order at 7:45 on a Monday night) so no one answered. I had already paid the delivery fee and tip when I placed the order. I am really angry that I get cold, bad food and they get to make a tip and delivery fee. Very disappointed with this lack of service and it's too bad because I enjoy the food, but not enough to make up for the service and this experience.
