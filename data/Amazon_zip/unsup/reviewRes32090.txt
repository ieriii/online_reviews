an obvious choice for the chicago vegetabletarian... it's sad though that one of the reasons why it's an "obvious choice" is because there's not many of its kind in the city. chicago diner though serves us some hearty vegan and vegetarian comfort food: burgers, wings, reubens, nachos, quesadillas. they have an impressive drink/dessert list including yummy vegan shakes. i was convinced to venture outside of my usual karma burger and tried the cali reuben. super good and flavorful and even more flavorful the next day. it's a shame that they won't expand their space. it was a bit of nuisance sitting up against the front door but we were happy to be seated right away as the waitlist very quickly grew behind us.  wonderful, patient service!
