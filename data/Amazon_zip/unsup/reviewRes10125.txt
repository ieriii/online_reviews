I must say I've become a big fan of this place after a couple of visits on different trips to Chicago. The vibe is awesome and super friendly and while its busy its not packed shoulder to shoulder at the bar which is nice.  Both times we actually were able to get seats by the bar very quickly. The pizza is amazing and the brews I've had have been superb.  Also, the draft towers are just some of the nicest looking draft towers I have seen anywhere. If you are in Chicago this place comes highly recommended from me!!!
