I love it!!! Great music, great service, cool owner (David), really tasty creative cooking, totally relaxed atmosphere, easy street parking -- this is what Chicago's about! Good for hanging out with some solid food options not generally found in a bar. I've been back twice, so far. Looking forward to my next visit. A great contribution to the blossoming Western Corridor!
