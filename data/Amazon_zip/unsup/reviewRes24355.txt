First thing to note, wear something that's not dry clean only. You will leave here smelling like fondue. Like the old days when you could smoke in bars and restaurants. Its in your hair, your skin, your clothes. Everything. Also this seems to be the place where affairs happen. At least that is the vibe you get. Regal Beagle circa '79.  I do like this place but go when you have a deal otherwise you'll feel cheated. Its an expensive gimmick!  They do have an ok wine list and the cool thing is if you get a bottle and don't finish it, they will bag it and make it so you can legally leave with it.  Of course the highlights are the meats and dipping sauces, and the chocolate. If you leave here hungry then you did it wrong!  If you're at the bar the bartender is really nice and chatty and they have this cheese spread with individually wrapped crackers. Really old school! It is the kind of place where you don't need to go twice. But if you're craving fondue in a romantic, somewhat cheesy atmosphere, then this is the place!
