This is what Korean comfort food is all about! This was, hands down, the best meal I've eaten in a long time. My fab friend and I split our dishes. The korean fried chicken was everything I wanted it to be: juicy, meaty, crispy, crunchy, and piping hot! The seoul sassy sauce was sweet and mild, and I am definitely drooling as I type. The bulgogi rice bowl was comforting. The meat was sweet and juicy, and the steamed rice was hot, fluffy, and filling. Glad I found this find on Yelp! Not a huge fan of the communal tables a la Urban Belly, but I can't wait to come back.
