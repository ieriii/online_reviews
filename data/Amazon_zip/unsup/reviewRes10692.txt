I came here for New Year's brunch and meant to write a stellar review, but somehow didn't get around to it; so here it is, a bit late: I had the cranberry and yellow corn flapjacks with maple-nut butter...wowza! So good it almost felt naughty! I got a half-order and it was still ginormous; I couldn't finish it. The pancakes were fluffy with gooey bits of cranberries in it and the butter was fragrant and nutty. I should mention that I don't think it's normal to be able to just walk in and get seated. There always seems to be a long wait. On New Year's day in particular, there were hordes of angry customers waiting in line, in the cold, to be seated. I waltzed in and politely asked the host if there was anything at all available for one solo eater and he seated me right away at the bar...largely to spite the over-entitled complainers in the waiting area, haha...and I don't blame him at all. Sometimes it amazing how far a little friendliness will go. The service during my meal continued to be excellent and all I can say is I wish Chicago was not thousands of miles away, because I could easily make The Bongo Room a regular spot!
