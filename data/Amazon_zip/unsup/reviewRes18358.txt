Thank you fellow Yelpers! My friend, Sean and I tried Caro Mio based on the reviews! We were heading to the Green Mill Sunday Night and had a taste for Italian! As I always do, I look to yelp for help for somewhere in the area!  Caro Mio is a great little place!  I ordered the tortellini pastichatta. It was very rich in favor! Sean ordered the Spicy Shimp and pasta, he was very happy also. Caro Mio is a great place to share a bottle of wine and relax. (especially after the holidays). It was so relaxing we were late for the show at the Green Mill. Leave it to two Italians to lose track of time gossiping over wine! Caro Mio is BYOB.. so if you are looking for a place to help enjoy all the wine gifts from the holidays.. Caro Mio is the place!  Parking was easy, the service was nice, I was very happy!
