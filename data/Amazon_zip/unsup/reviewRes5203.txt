A little disappointed. Ambitious menu that didn't quite live up to what I was expecting. The same vinegar base seemed to run through many of the dishes and while it was tasty it ultimately lacked imagination. We sampled about 11 dishes and none of them sucked but none had any 'wow' presence. The pork liver pate was texturally perfect but a bit heavy handed. The prosciutto bread balls were uneventful and the marinara with it was bland and sweet. The biggest disappointment was the bone marrow. The bread they served it with was delicious but the butter and garlic completely overpowered the marrow which, on it's own never seemed to have absorbed any of the herbs as promised on the menu. And so it went... It really felt like a Publican knock off without Kahan's talent to give it any soul. Service was minimal - brusque and inattentive. We waited a long time trying to order courses and our server offered us nothing in the way of either recommendations or personality. Music was okay but the low fi sound system just made it annoying at the volume they set. I wouldn't refuse to go back - I'd like to try the pork shoulder - but it certainly wouldn't be high on my list.
