I tried this new brewery Saturday night with a few friends. I anticipated a hostile hipster crowd b/c of the area but I was pleasantly surprised that this place had quite an eclectic mix of people; older couples, younger groups and even families. We got there early (6:00 pm) and put our names in expecting a long wait. The host and hostess were extremely nice and seemed to have things under control with seating everyone in a timely manner and after about an hour wait, we were seated. We ordered the bacon fat popcorn, wings and the sausage platter to start. The wings were great, a spicy buffalo sauce that came with some type of potato salad, the sausage platter is what it is and the bacon fat popcorn...well I expected more. It was literally just popcorn sprinkled with parmesean cheese with sage mixed in and bacon cut up and placed on top. I don't know why but I expected something so different. I ordered the fish and chips which were amazing, fresh fish with a terrific beer batter and a friend ordered the pizza with pork, bacon and something else on it. I had a slice and it was surprisingly VERY good. The other (2) ordered the burger, topped with pulled pork...yep that's right a burger topped with pulled pork. As if that wasn't enough, they added bacon.... So I sat there while they ate waiting for one of them to have a heart attack but luckily they didn't. They did however RAVE about the pork and the burger and how it was so good. They chose the garlic mashed potatoes as their side and I can attest, those were some of the best potatoes I've had (and I'm a mashed potato expert). They also had a great selection of botttled beers in addition to their own brewed beers and carried Goose Island orange soda and rootbeer. Our server was very friendly and the whole place had a very warm, friendly atmosphere. I would most definitely return to try a few more items on the menu!
