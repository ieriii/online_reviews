Was there in February- and made line for over an hour in the freezing cold to get in and managed to get a parking ticket in the process. But totally worth it once you get inside. Decor and seating arrangement is awesome. Just a tad bit to dark. They have several awesome drink choices. Come as soon as they open or be prepared to wait about an hour to get in.
