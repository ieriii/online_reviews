Great place. Really good food. Friendly and generally competent waitstaff.  Unlike SOME Yelp reviewers who have been to this location a few times and dis it for being family friendly -- I don't mind that one bit. They give kids crayons and something to keep them distracted and quiet until their food arrives, and they have an extensive kids' menu. This is to the advantage of everyone in the place, with the possible exception of people who don't like kids.  So if you don't care for the family-friendly atmosphere, don't like kids and continue to go to this Wishbone location, leave it to a dummy to get on the roller coaster knowing it'll make them throw up and all the while expecting a good time.  Wishbone likes families. You want to be undistirbed on a date, go to a singles bar. Hold your business meetings where they should be held -- at your office. Wishbone's not the place for that. Keep up he awesome job, Wishbone!
