Make reservations, or you might end up waiting for a seat at a bar for nearly an hour. Whether it is a weekday night or weekend, this place is bustling, and for good reason! It's a tapas-style kind of place, so get several plates to share (maybe 2, 3 each if you're looking for dinner) and you might not want to arrive ravenously hungry unless your wallet can afford it. I particularly like starting with a prosciutto, then maybe something with squid. I usually just order randomly off the menu and I feel like every dish I've had here has always satisfied my taste buds. Even though they are busy, the service has always been friendly. Standouts include calamari with fregola, milk braised pork shoulder, and mussels with pancetta
