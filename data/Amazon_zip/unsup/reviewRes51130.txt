I was a little surprised at how small the restaurant is. The entry door was separated from the dining room with a heavy velvet curtain and our table felt very drafty. The menu was interesting. We tried the Gumbo, Shrimp over Grits and the Burger. Everything was well done except for the Gumbo which was made with a dark roux. It came out a tad dark that we had a hard time visually identifying the ingredients of the dish. Service was good and waitress was friendly.
