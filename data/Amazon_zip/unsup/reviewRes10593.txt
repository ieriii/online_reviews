About once a year or so I come to Chicago for an extended visit, to see family and old friends. One of the things I usually do is organize some sort of dinner with a bunch of friends who all know each other, but don't really see each other with me in town. So it's basically like it's annual Neil Day! This year, based on advice of one of my friends, I decided we would meet at Piece for dinner. Having a party of 10, I tried to make a reservation, but alas, at 11AM on day of (a friday), they were already out. of reservations. It turns out that since we got there between 6 and 6:30, it was no big deal and we had a table soon enough. The food here is decent - I really enjoyed both the goat cheese and guacamole appetizers. The pizza is good, but not great. The toppings and sauce are actually incredibly tasty and well prepared, but I am not a fan of their crust - which I guess seems to be the major contention. It was perfectly decent, but I prefer thin crust pizza with some crispness, and theirs is very soft. Also, because of the oblong shape of the pizzas, their plates are inadequate to contain many of the 'radially' cut slices! The beer that I had, the Full-Frontal Pale Ale was quite good, a well balanced blend of hops and malt, approaching an IPA in flavor, but tilled as an American Ale. I probably should have tried another variety as well, but perhaps some other time. To sum it up - OK pizza, and good beer.
