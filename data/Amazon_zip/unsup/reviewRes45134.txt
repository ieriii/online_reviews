Continues to be a great place for dinner. Had to get the grilled octopus app again because it is SO good but lots of the others sound good too. I think they do a great job cooking fish here; if you're a fish lover I highly recommend getting any of the fish dishes. They're currently featuring lots of early spring veggies so mine (the whitefish) had leeks and purple artichokes... delicious. They no longer have exactly the same orange cake for dessert - it's got pistachios in it now. I liked it better before but it's still good.
