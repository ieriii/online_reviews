This place looks like a small little hut located in an area you wouldn't think to find good food at but it always seem to catch my attention every time I drive by. I was lucky enough to be able to persuade my friend to come with me so we can have a little taste of Cuba, and I must say I was not disappointed!!! We ordered a cubano sandwich served w/a side of fried plantain chips, croquettas, a beef empanada and a cafe con leche. The sandwich was delicious (especially the buttery/crispy bread they used) and for anyone who likes a little kick, just add some hot sauce and you'll be in sandwich heaven. The plaintain chips were deliciously addicting and the croquettas were crispy on the outside and creamy on the inside. The cafe con leche I must say brought my meal together and was a good end to my meal. The service was good and the prices were even better, I'd definitely come back here for a quick delicious meal.
