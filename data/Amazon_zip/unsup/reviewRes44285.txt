I was told of this place by another sushi lover friend of mine. It's right around the corner from my house and went there on a date recently. It's great because not only do they have an open bar, you can also do byob.  We started with the crab meat stuff wontons (aka crab ragoon). They came wrapped in a paper (that's a first for me) with the typical hot chili sauce. They were - o.k. A little flat and not enough filling.  Our sushi rolls were excellent and very nicely presented. The atmosphere is really what makes this place and something I will suggest in the future.
