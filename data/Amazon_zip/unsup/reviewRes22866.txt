So I'm a bit of a frommage pyro. Yes, I love to see cheese lit on fire. Yet, while Kraft canned Cheddar is sufficient for daily cravings, I especially look forward to a special serving of sheep's milk feta aflame at Greek Islands. I also happen to love salt, and have been known to lick the salt off my life vest when boating. Sorry but do not be alarmed. I love good food too including the very light and fresh Greek salad which is served here! Oh and let's not forget the Nostos wine. So if there are four things I love in one place then I suppose that equals four stars!
