had the well traveled whites flight...pretty good... tried some cheeses...loved the aged chedder not really sure what I had for dinner, but it was really good... it was like a mushroom manicotti with lentils Pumpkin cake was delicious... cool place, great ambiance... It was pretty packed the day we went...
