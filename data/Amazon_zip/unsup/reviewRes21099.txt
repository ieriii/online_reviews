Yelp led me to Mayan Palace, and I am so glad! I visited on a Thursday evening which just happens to be 50% off margaritas. I had an opportunity to try both the mango and strawberry frozen margaritas. Both were excellent! The chips and salsa were quite good, and we polished off a basket before our food arrived. For our meal we split the Chicken Jr Burrito and the Chicken Fajitas. Both had great flavors and were cooked wonderfully.  Great margaritas, good food, and excellent service. You can't go wrong!
