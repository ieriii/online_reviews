A couple of nights ago, my wife and I (... and the trend continues with all my reviews...) *when we were really hungry* headed out to India House with my brother-in-law in tow. We made a reservation a half-hour in advance and were seated shortly after arriving. We had some fairly good baby naan on the house and then ordered the Cheese Pakoras appetizer and split the Samundari Kadhai, Chicken Makhani, and Vegetable Biryani for dinner. The restaurant claims to use the freshest ingredients and compared to Indian restaurants in other cities I am willing to believe them. Everything was good, but my table agreed that the Samundari Kadhai was really outstanding - managing to be spicy yet still letting the crab and lobster flavor come through clearly. The wait staff was also particularly attentive with the decor being pleasant and upscale compared to other Indian restaurants I have dined at. I have yet to go to another Indian restaurant in Chicago, but I'll be very impressed if I find a better place.
