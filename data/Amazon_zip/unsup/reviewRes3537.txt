I agree 100% with Brittany P. This place is amazing. I took my grandmother here. She usually hates all non-italian restaurants, but loved the chicken. Thank you Crisp for giving me one pleasant restaurant-dining experience with my grandmother where she didn't try to speak Italian to all the Mexican bus boys.
