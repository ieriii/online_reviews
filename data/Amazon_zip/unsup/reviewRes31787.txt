Great Pan Asian food and sushi with a fun lively atmosphere. Sunda has great service and the restaurant has a beautiful modern tasteful decor that isn't overdone or too stark. Everything on the menu from the seafood and beef entrees, sushi and desserts are wonderful. We had some curried codfish, sushi rolls, brussel sprout salad (yum), beef tenderloin and molten chocolate cake and the bread pudding for dessert. I loved our waitstaff and they brought over free shots of sake. Sunda rocks.
