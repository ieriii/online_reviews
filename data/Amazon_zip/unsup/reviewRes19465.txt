If you want one of the best sandwiches in Chicago go here and order anything off the menu. I think the entire set-up is great. The huge line out the door only adds to the ambiance and makes it feel like you're getting something extra special when you finally do make it up to the line. I personally liked the chicken and chorizo sandwiches the best but I've had the entire menu and it's all amazing. Do not miss this place- one of the best in Chicago!
