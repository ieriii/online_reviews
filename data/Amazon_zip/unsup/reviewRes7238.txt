I live only a few blocks away from q and couldn't be happy to have a real non-touristy steakhouse in the neighborhood. I really loved everything about q. The decor reminds me of a beach house in North Carolina and the servers' plaid shirts were friendly and crisp. The prices were also incredibly affordable.  As for the food, it was delicious an plentiful. The pickles and chips appetizers were a great and unique touch. I had the smoked chicken and loved how the bbq sauces were brought out in separate dishes so you could try a bit of all of them (no spicy for me!). I also had the cornbread (my favorite southern side) and tried some of the coleslaw, which was not too mayo-y. The vegetable side was brussel sprouts will apple, mushroom, and nuts (if I remember correctly) and that was also wonderful and huge. Definitely going back to this gem in the neighborhood!
