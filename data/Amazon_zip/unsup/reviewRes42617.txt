The quarter chicken special is the best deal in Lakeview. Pro Tip: Don't forget to dunk the chicken and pita in the grease / sauce mixture that drips to the bottom of the container! Delicious! The chicken is AMAZING. It's slow roasted for hours over an open flame. It's juicy. It's succulent. It's full of rich and sharp charcoal flavor. It is the best or possibly second best chicken I have ever eaten in my life. The sides are also good: garlic mashed potatoes are very basic but exactly what you would want from garlic mashed. The rice and beans are surprisingly good. Finally, they carry Bobtail ice cream - the seasonal pumpkin and egg nog flavors are creamy, rich, and refreshing.
