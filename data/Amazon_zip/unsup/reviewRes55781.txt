5 stars for lunch....We go here mostly during lunch and it is always wonderful, but I went there last night for dinner and wow, what a disappointment. When we arrived, the place was packed and it took a few minutes to get anyone to greet us. When the hostess did see us, she was very cold, hard to understand and barely looked at us. I didn't think much of it, for they were really busy. There wasn't any room at the bar, so we just stood there. It would have been nice if someone would have offered to get us a drink while we waited. Waiting that long without a drink was a bummer. I asked if they could hang our coats up and was told no. We stood in the front and watched the male manager greet and take care of regular customers, yet he never said anything to us. Calo obviously has a lot of regulars, but if they want to make new ones, they really shouldn't brush people like us to the side and make us feel like we don't matter. At the end of our meal, the bussers were clearing our table and getting it ready for the next customers, while we were still there. It was one of the rudest things I've ever witnessed. I don't care how busy they were, we just spent a lot of money there, and they didn't even say thank you. The difference between lunch and dinner is basically one thing, management. No matter how busy they are at lunch, the short female manager is great. And not just to the regulars, to everyone. Maybe the owner should take some service lessons from her? Until then, we'll stick to dining there at lunch where we are treated like people, not cattle.
