Went on a Sunday night, and had a memorably good meal. We were seated immediately at 6:30, but as it got later, the place really filled up. Started with cocktails; I had Longman Manhattan which was forgettable, while s.o. had 2 Old Fashioned, which were really tasty. For apps, we got meatballs, sweetbreads, and duck rillette. The highlight was definitely the sweetbread dish; a really inventive and delicious take with a savory acidic red pepper sauce. The meatballs with polenta were extremely tasty, but the iron-poker hot bowel containing cold meatballs and polenta was a turnoff. The big disappointment was the rillette. This had no duck taste, and the rillette portion was as big as my thumb...it looked quite silly on the plate and we had a good laugh. My entree was the chicken, which was prepared sous-vide and was very tasty. The accompanying pasta with morels was a travesty. The pasta was more overcooked than you would find at an all you can eat pasta bar, and the micro bits of morel were without taste and had a bad mouthfeel...and I love morels. The lamb shoulder dish was light and delicious; surprisingly good summer dish. For dessert, we ordered strawberry shortcake and bread pudding. The shortcake was definitely the winner here. Service was friendly and very informed. She came up with an excellent beer match for the lamb shoulder dish. Look forward to returning. It is my belief that this place is capable of churning out 5 star food if the kitchen is more meticulous with the details and I hope to be around when it is doing so.
