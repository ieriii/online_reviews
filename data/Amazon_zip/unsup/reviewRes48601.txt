This is the second time I've been here for brunch and absolutely satisfied with the food. Unfortunately, the service is abismal! I keep wanting to love the Publican whole-heartedly but their brunch service is slow, apathetic, and perhaps a little hungover. The first time I brunched with them in a party of four, our food came out cold (which when you're eating bacon and eggs, is kind of gross) and staggered. So while half of our table was eating, the other half was waiting without explanation or apology for 15 minutes. My most recent experience this past Sunday was again, a disappointment. Our waiter looked annoyed we were there, never brought out sugar or cream for the coffee as asked, and then disappeared for 45 minutes until they finally brought out our lukewarm food. Again, once the food came out I was excited because the quality is there, but don't count on good service. After giving it two shots, I won't be back for brunch again unless I stop begrudgingly giving 20% tips and just pay for what I get - great food.
