Now that I've been here a couple times and have experienced both floors, I'd have to say that this is one of my favorite spots in Chicago. I'm usually not a huge fan of non-traditional Asian food, but Le Colonial masterfully combines delicate Vietnamese flavors with bold modern style. In other words, do not expect traditional Vietnamese fare here. But, Le Colonial delivers much more than a sweet seduction of your palate. The service is perfect, with knowledgeable, attentive, and friendly waitstaff. Despite its name, the restaurant does not remind me of the oppressive or exploitative side of early 20th century Asia. The atmosphere exudes class and casual refinement with hints of exotic romance that warms even the coldest of Chicago winters.
