Damn you, Art of Pizza. The first taste changed my world, but after a couple years of loyalty, my last two orders have been disappointing to say the least. Last time I got a pizza delivered, I opened the box to find the pie smashed into one side, as if it had been dropped. I called to complain, and the staff was less than sympathetic. They told me that if I wanted to have another pizza delivered, I could save the one that had been dropped and wait another hour for a replacement. Yeah right. I asked about the possibility of a discount next time I ordered instead, and the person I was speaking with said, "I'm sorry, I'm going to have to let you go." Um. Okay. Tonight, I decide to give them another chance because the pizza really is good...over an hour later, I'm still waiting on my delivery. Maybe third time's the charm? I don't know if I have the patience to find out. *Pizza just arrived, 20 minutes behind schedule. It's definitely been sitting for awhile, but at least this time it looks like a pizza.
