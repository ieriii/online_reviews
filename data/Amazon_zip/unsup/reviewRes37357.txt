I used to be a huge beer girl. I can't say I'm NOT a huge beer girl but I've strayed far from my love for hard liquor. Hopleaf probably re-ignited my love of good beer. The huge chalk board on the second floor with all the bottles of beer that they have? I seriously started salivating. I only had two, and I stuck to the safe side but I surely want to go back and be more .. well.. fun. Oh and food? I ate food here too! The selection was small but I got the Lamb Stew, by suggestion of my date, and it was fucking fantastic. Amazing even. Perfect, maybe. Overall I loved Hopleaft and I'll be back, hopefully.
