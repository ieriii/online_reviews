I guess there is nothing novel about recommending the mussels, but there is no shame in being one of 411 people to say they are superb. Otherwise, I haven't had a bad bite at Hopleaf. Hype worthy. Just don't contemplate not ordering water and no beer on a Monday - the waiter might respond - so, you do realize that you're at Hopleaf, right? Hey waiter guy - I can order dank beer lots of places. While I love your beer selection and respect it's elite nature, the food is what sells me on Hopleaf.
