Take your out of towner friends here. It is the quintessential introduction to Chicago style pizza. Beware, average person can only finish 1 slice, 2 slices if you are a super hero. Be prepared to wait 40 minutes as Chicago style pizza takes a while to prepare. The wait is worth it. The pizza is super even for locals, but the place is fun and provides a great Chicago experience for your visiting friends.
