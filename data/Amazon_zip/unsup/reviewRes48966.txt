Such a great space! Not surprising at all to find The Publican is part of the same corp. family that owns the Violet Hour. The interior decorator did a crazy good job on this place. I love the use of these industrial buildings for new purposes, this one fits like a glove. The food is really fresh and the menu tells you exactly where its coming from. Lots of local meats, veggies and brews from Midwest farms and breweries! LOVED it. Great for a small group since you have the option of ordering small medium or large plates. Share and get a taste of everything you can!!
