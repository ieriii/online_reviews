This is one of my favorite places in Chicago, but get ready to pay - and occasionally wait outside - for the experience. The decor is mysterious and elegant, and the space feels both intimate and open at the same time. The drink selection is large and creative, though there are a lot of classics on the menu, too. (Definitely go for a cocktail with egg whites!) Some of the waiters and waitresses take themselves too seriously, but it adds to the aura.
