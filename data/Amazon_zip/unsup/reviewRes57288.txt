I live close to the Bad Apple and after one so-so experience decided to give it another try yesterday. Unfortunately the Bad Apple food is still Bad. The beer list is respectable but the burger was once again pre-fab and nothing special. The turkey sandwich was lunchmeat on bread. To top it off they make their own ketchup -which tastes like marinara sauce at room temperature. .  Yuck. With Jury's and the Daily Bar and Grill a short walk away...I'd suggest you take the walk.
