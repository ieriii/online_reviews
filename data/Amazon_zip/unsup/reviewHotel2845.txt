Review is for the hotel as a conference center. It was fine and functional. The setup with the escalators to go between the various floors is confusingly laid out, all the up escalators are on one side and all the downs are on another. Kept going to the wrong side. The lobbies were fine and comfortable. The staff at the bar were pretty brusque though. The wi-fi access is poor in many of the conference rooms, which was very frustrating. The bathrooms are nice, meeting rooms were standard. The downstairs rooms for exhibitions were set up very poorly for cleanup - major exhibition with about 100 different tables giving out papers, brochures, food, and in the end there were like two small trash cans for the entire room, so there was trash everywhere.
