I really wanted to love this place. I'm from New Haven CT and have been craving pizza from my homestead since the day I moved here. When I heard about Piece I ecstatically convinced my friends to celebrate a birthday here. I have to say I'm so disappointed about our douche bag waiter's attitude that I just don't ever see myself going back. I understand this is in the mecca of hipsterville but his sarcasm actually caused an extra $10 dollars on my bill because I couldn't tell whether or not he was joking about an order question I had. Just tell me an honest answer to my question! I may give it another shot because I did enjoy the thin crust pizza, but I'm not sure I want a side of feeling idiotic.
