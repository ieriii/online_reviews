I loved Bad Apple as a vegetarian (the Strange Famous & the chick pea salad & the beet salad are all delightful!) & I love this place even more as an omnivore (most recently tried the Peppered Kraut burger, which was delicious & it helps that they use grass-fed beef for their burgers. The beer list is phenomenal & always changing. I've tried so many great (& only a few so-so) beers here that I would have never tried elsewhere. Service is normally great. Out of a dozen visits, we've only had crummy service once (an off day) & the staff is always friendly with our son (if you arrive early enough it's totally a family-friendly spot).
