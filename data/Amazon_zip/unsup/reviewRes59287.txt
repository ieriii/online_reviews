This is a catch-all Asian restaurant, nothing spectacular. I know my Thai restaurants well, and I wouldn't come here if you're really looking for taste explosions. Sushi is fine, and it's a good backup plan if you can't seem to find a restaurnat on Broadway that can seat you. I'm really into their crab rangoon too. Sounds like a popular appetizer here.
