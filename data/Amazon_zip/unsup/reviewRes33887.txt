Yolk is pretty much like eating at a diner, but cleaner and brighter. They were incredibly patient in letting our table linger and chat, even though there was a huge line. I found the menu to be rather uninspired and went with the "Mile High" omelet, which was really just a Denver omelet. Get it? Mile High. Denver. Clever.  The potatoes were incredible. Seriously. They put Orange's potatoes to shame. Veggies beware: I strongly suspected that they cooked the potatoes in bacon grease (probably why they're so good). The coffee was good, but the cups were small and there weren't enough refills for my taste. I'll probably go back, but I won't crave it.
