It's been 3 days since I ate at Caro Mio and I'm still drooling over the cipollino pomodoro salad. It's a sinus clearing, taste bud bursting plate of delciousness. BEST. SALAD. EVER! I know what you're thinking...a salad, right?. Men shouldn't eat salads and besides it's "just a salad"...Caro Mio doesn't just do salads. Tomatoes, onions, gorgonzola cheese, extra virgin olive oil, oregano and basil have never been paired together so perfectly in a way that makes my mouth explode. One bite is all it takes to realize that you no longer want to share this salad. Welcome to flavor country. If you are dining at Caro Mio, make sure to get the cipollino pomodoro salad. Okay, I think I've made my point. The rest of our dinner was very enjoyable. The service was friendly, the owner very accomodating, and I really had a nice time at this lovely BYOB. I also ordered the gnocchi gratinati with a meatball on the side for dinner. The gnocchi were like soft pillows so the texture was amazing. The bolognese sauce it came with was hit or miss and the meatball could have been done better. As far as Italian food goes, I've had better but definitely enjoyed my time here. I will be back for the cipollino pomodoro and to try something else on the menu. Until then, I will keep that salad in my dreams.
