I came to Big Jones for a brunch with a fairly large group. They were great and gave us a big table in the back, all the while keeping up with who had just arrived, who needed more coffee, etc. They served the coffee and juices fresh and were quick with refills, which is a huge plus. Our waitress was nice and knowledgable about where most of the produce, dairy, and meat came from. I love that a restaurant puts emphasis on aspects like that, and doesn't see it as an inconvenience when asked! I really feel like I can only give three stars, though, because I had some complications with my meal. I told our waitress that I was vegan, and if there was anything they could make vegan, it'd be great. They have salads, etc, so I didn't think it'd be a big problem. She recommended a few foods on the menu that she said could be made vegan. I chose the sweet potato soup, excited that they didn't use a cream base (I assumed, since she said it could be made vegan.) Until she said that the cheddar biscuits were vegan as long as you didn't add gravy... I'm not entirely sure she knew what vegan meant, and I probably should have said something, but they were really crowded and the soup was brought out almost right away, so I kind of figured the damage was done dairy-wise, and letting it go to waste wouldn't be much better. It was delicious soup, for what it's worth, but it did taste like it had dairy in it and it unsettled my stomach quite a bit. Perhaps on a slower day it'd be easier to go with dietary adjustments, and if you eat meat and dairy, the menu definitely looks wonderful!
