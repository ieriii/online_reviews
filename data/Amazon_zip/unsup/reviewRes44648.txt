A really trademark pizza place. Loud music, local dcor, family atmosphere - and it felt good! However, if you're looking for a classier atmosphere, check out the Giordano's near the Water Tower - we checked out that place yesterday but the wait was an hour, so we checked out this one today. The waiter was funny and a little crazy, and the pizza was hot and greasy! We ordered a small mushroom and pepperoni deep dish, and it filled up all three of us! A small! We possibly could have finished a medium, but our waistbands would have been uncomfortably tight by the end of the meal. The crust was like real pie crust rather than the pizza crust I'm used to - flaky, crispy, and REALLY good - and the cheese dripped all over the place in long strings. Yum. The only downsides were that the wait was a little long, even though we pre-ordered the pizza while we waited to be seated, AND it was around 3 in the afternoon (avoiding the lunch and dinner rushes! Maybe because it was near the ever-crowded Millennium Park?) Don't let that turn you away though - well worth the wait!
