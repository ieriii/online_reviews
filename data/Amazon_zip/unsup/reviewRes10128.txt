I would give the food a five star high five....everything we ordered was phenomenal, fresh and I couldn't stop eating! Both times I've eaten here I've been over the moon happy with my choices and the absolute deliciousness that is Piece.  I have been twice now, and the first visit was noticeably less clean than the second...but I have a feeling they were recovering from a busy weekend the first time I went.  The atmosphere is great, especially during a Bears game like tonight! I'm not a big beer drinker but my husband loves the beer selection and the service is my style-easygoing waiters/waitresses and very prompt.   My recommendation would be a red spinach and feta pizza and mixed green salad...next time I'll get the exact same thing...only I'll try dessert afterwards as well.
