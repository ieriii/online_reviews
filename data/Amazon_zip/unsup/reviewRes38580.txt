if you like beer more than almost anything else, you should go here. you should probably like standing up while you drink it, at least for alittle while. i have had a couple of snooty encounters here. i guess that just happens when your the hippest thing around... but overall the staff is great and the beer selection is great... and this place still manages to stay down to earth deep down. watch for the wine tasting events... they are a REAL. good. time.
