With over 900 reviews, it's hard to say much that hasn't already been said, especially when my 4 star ranking is consistent with most other Yelpers. But I'll put in my two cents. The beers at Revolution are nicely done - my favorite of the night was "Eugene" a porter that tasted like a rich iced coffee. Our table ordered the Bacon Fat Popcorn - it was OK, but I was expecting a deeper bacon flavor. For the most part, our group of four was happy with their entree orders, though the pulled pork was a little drier than expected. Irish stew and a burger got thumbs ups from my friends. I ordered the Italian Sausage Pizza and the smoked flavor noted on the menu was definitely present in this entree - I really liked it. It turned what could have been an ordinary pizza into something special. I considered putting the pepper flakes on it, but didn't want to miss out on any of the smokiness - good stuff. While I didn't have any dessert, those ordered at our table looked interesting. Atmosphere was nice and the place was busy during most of our visit, 8PM-11:30PM on a Saturday night. Service was good, though at the end of the evening someone in our group left a personal check on the table that was made payable to a non-profit. When we gathered outside the restaurant, they went back to get it and it was gone, even though the table hadn't been bussed. No one seemed to know anything about it - I suppose a customer walking by could have grabbed it, but from where we were seated, it was unlikely. Kind of odd.
