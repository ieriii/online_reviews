Of all the deep dish pizza spots in Chicago, Giordano's is my favorite, as well as the favorite of visitors. As a result, it's the spot I always take out of towners for Chicago style pizza. Unfortunately, the Rush St. Giordano's is always ridiculously crowded because of its prime location and the service has proved to be terrible time after time. Last time I was there, a 1 hour wait turned into over 2 hours because the hostess said we didn't put in our pizza order, when in fact we did and had the receipt to prove it was even put in at the instructed time. When we politely asked about our table, they kept telling us 15 more minutes, which ended up being about an hour. People make mistakes, but at least try to make it right, rather than giving your customers attitude and not caring. We were also told we'd be seated before our pizza was ready, but by the time we got seated we got a pizza that had clearly not come straight out of the oven.  It's too bad such good food is ruined by such terrible service. I give it 4 stars for the food and 1 star for the service. Go to the Giordano's by Millennium Park. The food is just as good, the wait is shorter, and the service is actually good.
