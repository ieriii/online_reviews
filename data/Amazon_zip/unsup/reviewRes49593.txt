It's a Colombian place, not South American because it doesn't include any other countries' food. The price is outrageous, we went for dinner, I ordered rice, avocado, yuca, plantains and mini salad; my husband ordered meat, rice, plantain and we both had one juice and the check was $45. This food in our countries is $5 tops. The service was slow. The people where nice, the quality ok. In conclusion: OK if you crave Empanadas which were good, and natural juice, but very overpriced.
