I have not been to Garcia's several times, and it is a solid Mexican restaurant.  The complementary chips and salsa are very good. The chicken and al pastor tacos are both Delicious. Their burritos are very large and have great flavor. Our only disappointment was the guacamole. Perhaps it was a one time thing, but it was very bland and oddly creamy.  While it is not the best Mexican around, it is good overall.
