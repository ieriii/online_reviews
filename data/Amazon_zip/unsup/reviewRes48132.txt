I love the Publican. I love the food. I love the beer. I love the staff. Everyone who works here is awesome. By awesome I mean, the you-are-now-on-my-list-of-people-I -bring-fresh-baked-cookies-to- during-the-holidays-because-i-love-you, awesome. The menu is always changing. If you talk to your server and tell them what you're interested in, they'll steer you in the right direction. This way you can try some new stuff, and order what looks good to you right then. Delicious pork. Some of the best oysters I've had in Chicago. A kick ass beer menu (it's seamless with the food menu- some really interesting and tasty options). Even the bathrooms here rule. Yeah, it may sound funny. But honestly, nobody wants to feel like they're walking into their high school gym locker room in between beers. Am I right? It's nice. And the soap smells better than any other soap in the world. True story. I have never left here unhappy. And I'm pretty damn sure I never will. ...did I say I love this place?
