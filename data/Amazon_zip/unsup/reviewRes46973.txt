This place is overrated and overpriced. Very nice atmosphere and setting, lively, busy, great live music. Unfortunately I went for the food, not the atmosphere. Not as vegetarian and vegan friendly as we expected. Went with some girlfriends; none of us liked our dishes so we ended up passing them around the table and trying them all. This place was definitely not worth the 45 min wait. Not recommended for vegetarians/vegans. The Dishes White bean & yellow squash ragout: wasn't a fan, a bit to salty and bean-y, not enough greens, didn't really like the texture, but interesting mix of flavors (some sweet spots!) Sweet potato ginger soup: meh... not impressed, very ginger-y tasting, baby-food-consistency and texture, I felt like it needed more salty spin to it... Prairie pure macaroni and cheese: very disappointed (esp being such a pricey dish $12), it's hard to mess up mac n' cheese, it wasn't bad but very plain, it definitely needed more spice/flavor to it, the bread crumbs on top added to the presentation but did not help the flavor/texture at all. Kraft's easy-mac is so so so much better. The apple slaw that came with the dish was horrible, haha, bland taste, awkward texture, two bites and I was done with it. Sweet potato fries & goat cheese fondue: very tasty! the one dish we really enjoyed. the sweetness is perfectly balanced with the umami of the goat cheese. The cheese was really creamy and warm, mmm! We ended up ditching our main dishes and ordering another sweet potato fries. This is the one dish I'd come back for.
