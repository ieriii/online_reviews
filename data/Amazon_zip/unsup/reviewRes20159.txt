Honestly, I was underwhelmed at Xoco's sister restaurant, Frontera Grill, but I loved Xoco. The wait on a Saturday around 12:30pm was 30-45 minutes (although they said an hour at the door), but it was totally worth it. My boyfriend and I tried the churros, authentic and Mexico City chocolate drinks, the lemongrass jamaica, the Pibil torta, and the Ahogada torta. I thought the chocolates and churros were just okay, but my boyfriend loved the churros. I could drink a gallon of the lemongrass jamaica though. Both tortas were super delicious - well spiced, salty, crunchy bread, and some citrusy flavors. Even though my mouth was burning, I couldn't stop eating minuscule bites of the habanero salsa that came with the pibil. So good! We sat at the counters near the windows, so we could people watch and actually have enough room for all the food we ordered plus my purse. Even though it's a small restaurant, I didn't feel too squished. On a second trip on a Friday around 11AM, there was no wait. By the time we finished eating though, a line had formed. The churros were better this time because they were still warm, plus we got the chocolate dipping side, which was nice. Bf got the Ahogada again, and it was just as solid. I got the pork belly vermicelli caldo, and although it was good, I prefer the tortas. Maybe it's the excellent Labriola bread? Either way, it was still tasty. Will go back again for more torta goodness.
