Ok, I know it is hipster heaven, but I just love the Chicago Diner! It's in a cool neighborhood, has a hip atmosphere, and of course some the best vegan food around. It's a great place to take visiting vegan and veggie guests to give them a little taste of Chicago. I only wish the wait wasn't always so long, and that they didn't cram so many people into such a small space. The wait staff is often overwhelmed, and if you don't stay on top of the hostess, you may get overlooked. I've only sat on the patio once, but it was a lovely and fun experience. You do pay a little more, but that's to be expected from vegan dining in a trendy part of town. The menu does change seasonally, but I have almost always loved the food. I would highly recommend the vegan cheesecake!
