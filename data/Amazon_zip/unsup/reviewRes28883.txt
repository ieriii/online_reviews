Been going to Pequads for years. When the old Great Ace was across the street from them. I used to go over there after work with co-workers.So when you get a good pan pizza it's the best thing but sometimes go back and it sucks.It hit or miss with them mainly stingy with toppings. "xtra is xtra & nothing is for nothing" been there slogan. raise your prices and if the pie is worth it great.if not oh well.
