How good can this place be, you may wonder. Well it blew me away with every bite. The food was so fresh and flavorful, it was all exceptional. The guac was the best I have ever tasted. The duck was tender and mixed with the mole and sweet potatoes perfectly. Even the black beans as a side were great! The basics like red and green salsa rocked, and the chips and tortillas let you know that you weren't at a normal texmex place. This place is busy all the time. We stood in line at 4:30 for 15 minutes to get a table for six at 7:00 pm. Not a bad system! Our server, Pancho, was casual but professional and had the whole menu memorized. He worked with my wife who wanted a substitution on her tacos. He gave her several options until she found something she liked. I get nervous when waiters don't write anything down, but Pancho got our whole order and subsequent cocktail refill requests filled perfectly. Highly recommended, among the best in Chicago.
