Food = FantasticPrice = Expensive but well worth it.Atmosphere = Very romantic but the lighting could have been better-I couldn't see if my food was cooked enough.Service = Great! One of the best waiters I've ever had! Also, when I called to make a reservation, they asked if we were there for a special occasion. It was our anniversary and unexpectedly during dinner the waiter gave us complimentary glasses of campaign and wished us a happy anniversary-great personal touch!
