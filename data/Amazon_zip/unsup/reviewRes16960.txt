Went for din the other night--for the first time in my life, I saw my parents get totally overwhelmed by a menu. Heaps of options, many of which will be familiar to anyone for whom Indian food doesn't just mean greasy curry. Had a hiccup to start--we asked the waiter for recommendations and all he said was "samosas"--okay, we are white, but give us a little more credit. I know how to appreciate more than just potatoes wrapped in dough and then deep friend. Come now. So I took command. They brought the wrong soup to start--it was a watery dal, so by now I was skeptical, but the entrees were all excellent. 1) Tandoori salmon (smooth, flavorful, slightly dry but not unpleasant), comes w/ dal (yummy this time), rice, and naan). 2) Chaat Masala. Delightful. Piping hot, spicy to boot, well size portion. 3) Palak Paneer--spinach and cottage cheese, can't really go wrong w/ that. 4) Mushrooms and peas in spices (I know, very sophisticated descrip) Garlic naan and Jaipuri paratha. They have no shortage of bread options--ours were solid, the paratha being more enjoyable. Din for 3 w/ no wine was $93, but we may have over ordered a tad--my inner fat kid is of course, an inherited trait.
