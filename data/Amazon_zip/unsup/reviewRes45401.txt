I came here last night with fellow Yelpers last night after DYG at Cesar's. I had never heard of it, and no one knew where it was - cue us all whipping out our blackberries and iphones to look it up on yelp. Hilarious. This place confused me. We walked in and I thought it was a restaurant, yet they had a DJ playing some dancy-stuff and there were people dancing amongst the tables and booths. It wasn't very crowded, and one bartender was on top of everything and the other one flat out ignored me the second time I went up for a drink. Wtf? Overall I had a good time and it's a cute place (LOVE the bathrooms), and I'll keep it in mind for the future.
