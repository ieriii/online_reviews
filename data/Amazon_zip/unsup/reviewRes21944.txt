Got s Superdawg with a side of Superveggies. The dog itself was ok. The pickled tomato was good, but wasn't really "on" the dog, they just add a random chunk of tomato to the box. Speaking of the box - worst packaging ever. The fries (which come with every order) were soggy and tasted like grocery-store frozen fries done in tepid oil and the box made it worse - the steaminess of the dog just added to the moist fry mess. Superveggies were the saving grace of the meal, but I would've much preferred the option to get a fry-less dog and just get the veggies. The carhop service is a nice gimmick, but hardly makes the food worthwhile.
