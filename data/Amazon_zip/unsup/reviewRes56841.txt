This is one of my favorite restaurants EVER! I make a point to visit every time I am in Chicago. The food is out of this world. Great ambience, excellent service, and a fantastic menu! Try to get seated upstairs and don't spare any expense- the soups, appetizers, entrees, drinks and desserts are all pricey, but sooooo worth it.
