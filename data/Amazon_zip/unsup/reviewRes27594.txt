This is my absolute favorite pizza place in the whole world. The crust on the deep dish pizza is to die for. My first experience was as a young, nave college kid feeling cool in the big city. The atmosphere is very unassuming, but almost makes you feel right at home. Since becoming a city resident, I regularly order delivery and have always been happy with my choice. This weekend, I went in to pick up the pizza and it was packed. The host asked my name, told me where to pick up the pizza and it was in my hands within minutes. Upon leaving, the host thanked me and remembered my name. As if the pizza wasn't already worthy of 5 stars, I'm happy to say that the service is too. I'm sad that it has taken me this long to write a review on one of my favorite Chicago establishments, but I guess I am better late than never. Eat here now!!!
