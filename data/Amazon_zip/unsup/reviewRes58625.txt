Well, this is my first ever restaurant review since I don't normally get too excited or too upset about any food or service. But I could not help commenting this time because of the horrible experience. I have to say that the environment and food were both OK, but the service was the worst I ever had in ANY restaurant. From the moment we sit down it appeared like we owe the server lots of money. He did not respond at all when asked about the food and it looked like he wanted to say you don't know what you order anyway, so just order anything and get the hell out of here. When I order, he did not explain anything, even when I asked him what comes with the dish. At the end, he took away the appetizer without asking; claiming that he could NOT split a check; run up to collect the checks as soon as we signed it, and watched at the check carefully in front of us to make sure we left tip. I still left more than 15% tip because I was with my friend, but I have been regretting about it since I left. He did not deserve any tip and I should have reported him to his manager!
