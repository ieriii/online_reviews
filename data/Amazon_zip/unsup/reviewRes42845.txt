What a scene. If you're looking to grab a quick bite, this isn't the place for you. I went here with my cousin and her beautiful friend last Thursday night for dinner - we made an 8:00 reservation. Nobody's in a rush here, but unlike some of the other reviews, I didn't feel any rudeness at all from the staff. The place was hopping, both bar and restaurant, and it was filled with really good looking people who seemed to having a good time. Our meal lasted about 3 hours, which was partly our fault and partly just their lassiez faire attitude. My cousin decided to make our champ of a waiter patiently and expertly describe every freakin wine on their list, and when he finally convinced her to try a bottle of his favorite white, she hated it and actually sent it back. Instead of getting pissy, he brought us a free appetizer and helped find a more suitable bottle. I stuck to beer, of which they have an impressive selection that I thoroughly enjoyed. I sat with an empty glass for at least 20 minutes before anybody cared, but it wasn't a huge deal. The food was actually pretty interesting. The portions weren't huge, but we shared everything and had a nice meal. Memorable delicious dishes include the roasted bone marrow on toast and the damn tasty pork belly. Maybe it was just that my cousin brought some very enjoyable company (I could have stayed there all night talking to her), but I really enjoyed my experience at Gilt Bar. I don't feel the need to rush back any time soon, hence the 4 stars, but I have no complaints other than feeling like one of the least wealthy/cool/beautiful people in the joint.
