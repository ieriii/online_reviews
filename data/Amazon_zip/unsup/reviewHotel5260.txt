My husband and I stayed there over Mother's Day/babymoon. All the staff we ran into were very nice, professional and helpful. We stayed in a room on the 30th floor which was super cool. The room was clean, comfortable and well taken care of. I actually liked that the toilet was separate from the rest of bathroom. There was a separate shower stall and soaking tub as well. Didn't use the tub but the shower was so-so. The nook is a little small and we had to move the showerhead over so that when it turned on it didn't spray all over the floor of the bathroom. The only thing that got a little annoying was that there was a HUGE Indian wedding going on when we were there. Oh well.All in all, great experience and we will return if the occasion presents itself again.
