Solid sushi. BYOB was AWESOME, and we brought a great wine to enjoy with our sushi. Really loved the Sunrise roll: great, surprising combination of mint, salmon and mango perhaps? (It was almost two weeks ago I was there, but I remember it was something different and I liked it a lot as a new combination of flavors I hadn't experienced in a maki roll before.) The place also has a trendy vibe to it which was fun.
