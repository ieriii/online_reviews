I went here with my boyfriend for a company holiday party and was pretty impressed. I loved the overall atmosphere and decor, it seemed like a very cool place to be. We did not have a sit down dinner but a buffet of everything you could think of. The wait staff was as nice as can be and the drinks were good as well. I would really like to come back for a sit down dinner and try some of those dishes.
