The Bistro which is in the grocery is a find! A gem! Chef is turning out very tasty and creative plates, and seats facing the Chicago River. Best is no one knows so pre-movie, we had the place to ourselves. Duo Tartare of beef and tuna gave us separate piles of scrumptious delight to smear on good bread. Lobster Bisque was delicious, while the hanger steak was perfectly prepared, and tender! Attentive service, and interesting wines by the glass, or the option of going into the grocery and picking out any bottle at grocery. Menu was pricey, but well worth it! Evan
