Ok, I love beer. They make beer, really good beer. But that's just half of the occasion. I went to Revolution for brunch this past Sunday, picking it out hoping for some good beer for me and good food for the family. We all left stuffed and me a little tipsy, so everyone was satisfied. First, I tried a few tasters of current offerings, the Quadrupel was ok, but the Eugene and Hugene Porters were both excellent. The Eugene could actually be called an Imperial Porter by strength (7% ABV), making the Hugene....well, huge at 11%ABV. Now to the food, my wife had the blueberry cinnamon french toast which looked and smelled wonderful. Everyone raved about this one. I had the "Eggs in a hole", which was a very clever take on eggs benedict, with the eggs cooked in a hole in the center of the muffin, and floatng on their beer cheese soup. I'd like to say that everyone thought it was excellent, but they can't because I didn't share. Our son had the eggs to order, and finally we had to try the Cherry-Porter pancakes so we had some for the table. Again, outstanding. Really, between the beer and the food, this place is excellent. My family likes it, which means I get to have a few beers and they like the food. Win-win in my book.
