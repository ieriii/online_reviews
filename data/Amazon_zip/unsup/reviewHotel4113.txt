Parking is terrible if you self park. Valet service is over $40 a night plus tips. The rooms very confortable but what would you expect from the Hyatt family in the heart of Chicago. You pay high dollars and you will sleep well. I only stay here now when I must, it's too busy to relax like I can at the airport Hyatts. The area is great if you have business downtown, I would rather commute in the summer.
