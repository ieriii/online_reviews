Mrs. Publican: Welcome to Heaven, Chaz. Chaz: Thanks, table for one... puh-leasseeeee...... The absolute perfect restaurant, everything on the menu was something i wanted, an each thing more than the last. i settled on the pork belly with chocolate, pickled onions and something else crazy. but to start out the frites with egg, (delicious) and the daily pickles (Oh My Geezus) and a Sprecher root beer (bonus points for rawness) and for dessert a strawberry granita (slushy) served with whipped cream, pistachios and dried strawberry chips. wowzer. all in all, i was filled to a comfortable level. i was impressed by the lake of pretension. i felt like i was in my own home. the cool part about the food here is that, unlike many restaurants which try to take comfort food and make it modernized and with sophisticated ingredients.        while this restaurant does the exact opposite as it takes sophisticated ingredients and makes them feel like the food you eat at a barbecue, without the pretentious snubby feel you get at so many other restaurants. i heart publican.
