Well folks, I was so excited to take my daughter there for the first time to Hopleaf for her 21st birthday and to try out their new kitchen's version of those signature mussels chased w/ icy brews.The dish comes w/ at least a quarter of the mussels either cracked or unopened. The broth/sauce was salty%&%$&^#!!. We sent them back. The second batch w/ Belgian ale was similar. And the fine french fries were GREASY and soggy. What a colossal disappointment. What's a matter Hopleaf?. .
