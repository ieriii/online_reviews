This place is so good! The braised oxtail appetizer was good (but kind of hard to attack). The veal ragu was superb but a huge portion. My friend got their signature ravioli and it was the best I've ever had. I would suggest doing that in an appetizer portion, so everyone can enjoy it. The wine list was obviously extensive with a great selection, and the pours were generous. It is pricey so I would reserve this for special occasions, but make every effort to go here! One of the best Italian restaurants in Chicago.
