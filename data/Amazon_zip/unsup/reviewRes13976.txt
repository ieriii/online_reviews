Cute place nice menu a lot of fresh fish. I started with the clam chowder I must say it's as good as any I've had even in Seattle. Fir my main I had the Columbia River Sturgeon which is char grilled with a bacon mushroom cream sherry sauce ( I opted SOS, sauce on side The fish was fresh grilled perfectly the sauce had a smokey sweet flavor with mushrooms A nice complement . There was some Sauteed onions, peppers and squash on the side along with a potato cake which had a hint of blue cheese. A nice touch. I will defiantly come back.
