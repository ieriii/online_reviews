I've been coming to Sun Wah for years. It is seriously my family's choice for all things BBQ. The new location is spacious and clean. I only wish that they would strike a deal with the adjacent (empty) parking lot for parking. When we go in we usually walk out with tons of bbq good which makes walking down the street a bit of a feat. The restaurant itself is awesome. I have introduced this place to countless people in college and beyond. You always know if you got about $6 you can at least get a very filling meal plus left overs if you order their BBQ on rice plates or noodle soup. Stand out dishes for me here are: shimp stuffed tofu peking duck hot and sour soup (best in the city!) Roast Pork (ask for the belly cut for the most tender pieces) par-pei duck (carry out) chicken feet (yummmmmm) Ong Choy with fermented bean sauce Pretty much anything on the menu... check it out!
