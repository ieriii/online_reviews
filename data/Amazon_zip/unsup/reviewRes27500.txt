Oh my gosh. Pequods has the best pizza I have ever had in my life. My bro and I met up with an old friend and he chose some "pizza" place in Lincoln Park. We arrived at the place, and judging from the dcor outside, I wasn't expecting very much. I assumed this was just another pizza joint. We got there around 7:30 and we were a little surprised to see there was a bit of a wait (about 30 minutes, and this was on a Sunday night), but we were able to place our order. Considering the deep dish pizza takes about 45 minutes to make, the timing would be pretty good. Anyways, we sat down, drank some beers and soon the food arrived. When I first set eyes on our sausage/pepperoni pizza, I instantly could tell this was no ordinary pizza. The pizza was littered with sausage and pepperoni, mixed in with a rich color of pizza sauce. I took my first bite and the pizza was just delicious. The crust to pizza sauce/topping was perfect; there wasn't too much crust. And best of all, the caramelized crust was amazing. I've never had caramelized crust before and I was just taken aback at how good it was. No other pizza place that I've eaten at before even compares to Pequods. I'm going to have to include Pequods into my list of routine restaurants to eat at from now on.
