Definitely caters to a clientele that likes it a bit trendy, a bit posh, a bit funky. The staff were super nice and helpful, in a genuine way, which is notable in my book. Our room was a bit on the small side, but it didn't bother us a bit, we made it work. - we travel light (like each of us has a small backpack for four days kinda light), so we didn't have a problem making our stuff fit.  We got a great rate online which really made this hotel experience rock my world. I have to say, if we paid full-on rates, I'm not sure the amenities would be worth it for me. The wine hour was pretty sweet too. Free wine, a bit of food to nosh on, people watching, what could be bad about that?
