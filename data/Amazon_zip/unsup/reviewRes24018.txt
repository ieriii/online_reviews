I realize this is supposed to be one of the best Chinese restaurants in Chicago but I won't be going back ever again. My friends and I went there for lunch today and we were left speechless. None of us had ever been there before, but one on my friends was especially excited because she was considering having her graduation dinner there. Well, midway through our meal, Erin asks with her fork in mid-air, "Hey, you guys, can you take a look at this? What do you think this is?" Yep, we looked, eye glances were exchanged, and everyone put their forks down. It was indeed a cockroach! Gross. Needless to say, we told our server, got a lame excuse and were told the bill was on the house, as if there was another option. We were completely disgusted and left immediately. The worst part is that because Lao Sze Chaun is a family style restaurant, we have no idea which dish had the cockroach nor could any of us at the table be certain we hadn't already had a roach with our food...
