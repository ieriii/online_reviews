Awesome place! Love the attitudy crowd and especially love going to poetry slam night on Sundays. Great chicago event going on for years...its a must to see if you're visiting Chitown or living here. Love the Al Capone mobster vibe that has been preserved through the decor. If you're doing poetry night, come by 6:30 to snatch yourself a seat! Only reason this place got 4 instead of 5 stars is the seating issue sometimes.
