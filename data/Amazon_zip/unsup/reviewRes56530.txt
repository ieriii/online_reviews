Waited in line at 5pm, when opens == table seating does not occur immediately so everyone in line is forced into bar to buy drinks. Food ( duck tacos) medium warm, bean side dish also partially warmed.. overall-- californian not impressed at all .. Obviously fame has gotten to this place. Oh yeah somewhat surly waiter. Overall impression, mediocre.
