The Ritz Carlton Chicago doesn't compare to the other Ritz Carltons throughout the U.S. It has an older decor feel, like a Floridian sun room. It doesn't have that classy feel...and for the money, isn't that what you want? I went to a wedding here and although the main course was good, the rest was subpar and the room was a little blah. So if you're looking to stay in a nice hotel in Chicago or have a wedding downtown, consider The Peninsula, The Intercontinental or The Sofitel....my personal faves.
