Dined at Bonsoiree last week and loved every minute of it.  The atmosphere is cozy, warm, and romantic. We did the 5 course tasting menu and everything was absolutely delicious. The winter menu has incredibly fresh ingredients and the walnut cranberry risotto is perfect. Our server, James, was wonderful and helpful- explaining each meal and even giving us extra information without making us feel silly for asking obvious questions-very down to earth. BYO, which is a plus because it can save you a few bucks, but don't forget to bring a bottle of wine, Overall a top notch dining experience.
