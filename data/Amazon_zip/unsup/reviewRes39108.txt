Service kinda blows, but the food will blow you away!! Believe it or not, Korean BBQ is one of the best comforts after a long hard day at the batting cages! Four of my friends and I shared two raw meat orders- marinated short ribs and marinated beef, as well as a fried tofu appetizer. As we waited for our orders to come, we were brought like 25 different banchan (side dishes) and were freaking out because there was just so much variety and it all looked so good! They eventually brought out the coal grill and my friends and I took turns playing grill master, but the meat was just ridiculously delicious! Both the short ribs and sliced beef were juicy, tender, and oh so flavorful! The fried tofu appetizer was flavorless, so I was glad I only took half a piece. We had only finished a few plates of banchan when I declared that I was issuing our table the "BANCHAN CHALLENGE" in which we were to finish all of the plate of banchan. We ate strong- stuffing bean sprouts in our faces, shoving kimchi after kimchi in our mouths, throwing all the not-as-pleasant-tasting ones in miso soup and then eating it after the nasty flavor was off, whatever it took for us to finish them all! And we did! OH YEAH. Five little college girls demolished the banchan. Ah, and the waitresses. They weren't particularly friendly and checked on us once throughout the meal. We ran out of water during our meal and had to walk to the cashier area to ask for someone to refill our glasses. They seemed super annoyed with us at the end when my friends and I were figuring how to split the bill ($53- not bad) and pay because we took a little while on that. At this point, the waitresses were walking past our table more, probably waiting for us to pay and leave. We didn't really care about service anymore though, because our tummies were full and we were satisfied! MMMMMM!
