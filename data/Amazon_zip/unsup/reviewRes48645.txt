Yes, it's all been said. The Publican is everything I wanted it to be and more. Went here with three friends for a late, tasting-style dinner. We decided on the chef's selection of 12 oysters, chef's selection of three hams, pork rinds, sweetbread, and fries. It's amazing how simple these sound but how wonderful and complex they were. I'm not going to go on about it but if you like good beer and love pork, you must check this place out. Be sure to make a reservation and be ready for a loud open space that may be pretty crowded. Is there a place like this in NYC and I just haven't found it yet? If there is, someone please let me know.
