A good BBQ place with reasonably generous portions, kind service and a fun atmosphere. Chicago q is a large restaurant with a unique style. Food comes out quite quick, especially if you order one of their "pulled" dishes. The food could have been hotter and less "heat lamp" oriented, but the flavors were still decent enough. The three or four sauces provided lacked any unique signature if you will. This style of restaurant should spend more time on the sauce as it could create a more memorable experience. Their hot sauce was not hot! Service was good, but I was a bit appalled when the server recommended a beer he said was absolutely amazing and never tried it. The beer, Turbo Dog, was good but for him not to have tried something he recommended so strongly is poor technique. Overall good price points and attitude. Something worth trying, but not sure if it is the best BBQ place in Chicago. Good luck!!
