I suppose if you want a great beer that you're unlikely to find anywhere else in Chicago this *might* be the place to go. * But its the morning after and my ears still hurt.  *  I was hoarse after having to yell the entire meal.  (Just as an aside I've been to beer gardens in Germany and I never experienced anything this loud. I've also been to pubs in England, Scotland, Wales and Ireland...ditto). * They definitely skimped out on the blood sausage in the Tripe & Blood sausage gratin. There were two pieces of sausage in there...and they were both smaller than tiny marbles. * The service is slower than slow. They need more computers--at one point there was a line 3 servers long to enter orders. Nice planning. * I felt like it was too expensive for what I got...hoarse and a double earache. Overall, I'd say go to Benny's Beverage Depot to get more exotic beers. Save your ears, your voice and your wallet.
