Fiance and I had dinner here on Friday. Both had shwarma plates - one with lamb other with chicken. Needless to say we got very bad food poisoning and haven't been able to leave the house. Judging from a few other reviews back in February and March, sounds like others have experienced the same. My bachelorette party was Saturday night and it had to be rescheduled because I was confined to the bathroom. Thanks Sultan's. Stay away from here.
