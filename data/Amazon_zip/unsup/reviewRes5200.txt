I found myself staying downtown with no dinner plans, so of course I turned to Yelp to direct me somewhere new. When a place called The Purple Pig showed up only steps away from my hotel, we decided to give it a shot. We had no idea we would be in for such a delight after we passed under the random gate off Michigan Avenue. Highlights for our meal: - Grilled Cheese of the Day - Since they offer a large variety of cheeses for cheese plates, they take the leftover pieces and melt them into one amazingly tasty sandwich - Braised Baby Artichokes with Fingerling Potatoes, Asiago & Salami Toscana - Just the right balance of vinegar - Eggplant Caponata with Goat Cheese - This was SO good, I went back already and had it again. Eggplant is not a favorite of mine, but this dish changed my perspective. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_) And the best part? We stuffed ourselves silly with delicious food and the check was still just over $20 each! Though we didn't drink wine, their wine list looks worthy of another visit.
