Went looking for a good sandwich on a Sunday and found this shack. A shack with great music, interesting articles to read on the wall, minimal seating but fast service and some great sandwiches!! I had 1/2 a pork sandwich and 1/2 a steak sandwich. Yumm! ( love sharing!) The pork sandwich had this perfectly fried banana and the steak sandwich....mmm. The empanadas were real good also.  Prices were reasonable on the sandwiches and food overall but I felt the drinks were way over priced.I will definitely go back to try the other sandwiches.
