Good food, great price, quick service! That sums up my experience at Garcia's. The food isn't the best Mexican food around, but I enjoyed everything that I tried. The price is very reasonable. The ala carte menu has a great selection of inexpensive items. The service was friendly and unbelievably quick.  We got our food within 10 minutes of ordering. The location is perfect - right on Lincoln Square. There are so many stores and bars in that area if you are looking for something to do after you enjoy your meal at Garcia's. I will definitely be back for more!
