Our room was clean, roomy and comfortable. The walls were a bit thin so we could hear the neighbors - but they were a group of 20-something boys (yes, boys) so I don't think any hotel would have blocked out the drinker talk of "helicopter dick". This is more a reflection on the kids than the hotel. Bathroom was small but just fine - decent water pressure which is important to me. The best part of the hotel - LOCATION LOCATION LOCATION. It was perfect. Price was fine though we seemed to be there on a really busy weekend so I bet you can find different hotels for less money at certain times. Really, if you're looking for a place to sleep - this place is not as bad as reviews would have you think (someone complained about 'cheap tiles' in the bathroom? Really?)
