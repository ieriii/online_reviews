What is it about this place and people from out of town? They all demand to be taken here. We have to eat here multiple times a year and always because other people want to 'see' this place! The allure is beyond me. It's not that the pizza is bad, because it's not. The pizza is acceptable. But not incredible. There is better deep dish in Chicago. The crust is a kind of cornbready thing that doesn't appeal to me and the hubby too much. But, hey, we are accommodating hosts so off to this place we often go. If you are going to have pizza here, have the sausage. That's not bad. I've had the pepperoni and just cheese versions. But I like the sausage best. I will say, though, at least the place is consistent. You aren't going to show up one day and go "wow that was just awful" because the product remains the same. That's a definite plus for them. So, bring your guests and a Sharpie and enjoy.
