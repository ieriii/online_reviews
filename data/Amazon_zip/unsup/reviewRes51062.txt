When I moved into the city, the first thing I searched for was a breakfast place! I found a great one on my first try. Wishbone is different than your typical breakfast place. The decor is really unique---a little gaudy but in a charming way. The waitstaff is very friendly, makes me feel like I'm at a restaurant in a small college town! The menu has your typical breakfast fare at reasonalble prices, with some unique extra items on there, such as syrup soaked French Toast covered in corn flakes (enough sugar for a week!) and some inventive omelettes to mix it up!
