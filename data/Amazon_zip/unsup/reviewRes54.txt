Alinea... Our vacation dinner took place here nearly 4 months ago. However the memories of the flavor profiles still permeate my prefrontal lobe. I do not use the term vacation dinner lightly - this is truly an experience that will transcend culinary predispositions as well as American Express cards. Defining this dining experience is not something I can jot down in a few hundred words in some online review. Rather it is simply the experience of enjoying something that was designed, no destined, to be a work of art. I have eaten from delis, food carts, and extremely fine dining establishments across the United States, this was just distinctly different. My Beautiful Wife - in the awe of interesting meals coming faster than Nordstrom Rack Shoes Clearances, could not stop photographing and commenting on the distinctiveness of each dish. However, I sat awestruck - wondering how someone can sit around and think of an experience remotely similar to this culinary journey. We of course had the staples, 'hot potato - cold potato' and the desert that could easily be described as the next act at Blue Man Group. But it was the detail, no the attention to detail, that had me wondering. Where does Grant get this inspiration? When did the thought putting a pillow of pine-scented air on my table with a beautiful bowl enter his mind? The wine was wondrous. Please don't indulge without it. It should not be an optional component. This interface with the meal was critical to my understanding of the dish as well as my propensity of getting 'more' later on in the evening (thanks Grant!) I can easily close this review by writing a clich that each true "foodie" should experience the wonder that is Alinea. What I recommend is, hell, Go - spend the money. I can promise you won't be disappointed.
