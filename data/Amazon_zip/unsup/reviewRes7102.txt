The Prettiest BBQ joint I've ever been to. Which is not to say it isn't manly. The rub on the "competition style" St. Louis is like if Jesus made a rub, and then got it tweaked by Superman, and then a third draft by Remi the Rat from Ratatouille. The pulled pork is some of the best I've had. And all three of their sauces are completely different, yet all special. Just like children. Bonus points for having fancy sod and big ice cubes. Will be back.
