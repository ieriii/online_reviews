Food is okay. Fries and burgers are pretty yummy. The chicken wings are like bark that's been cooked in microwave than baked in an oven for 8 hours. How do you mess up a chicken wing and than charge 10 bucks. This place is too expensive. They could sell a couple of there TV and lower the prices or improve the quality of the food. Hooters is a safer bet and a better deal.
