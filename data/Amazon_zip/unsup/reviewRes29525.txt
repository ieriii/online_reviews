rick bayless is bad-ass.  at first i thought he was a little creepy, especially on his public access tv show. he's realllllly into the food. like reeeeeallly into it. using the words "succulent" and "tender" and "ever-so" is basically saying he wants to do the food. but it makes sense. that's why he is such an amazing chef. frontera grill is my favorite mexican restaurants in the city. duh, make reservations - he's one of the top chefs in the city. it's a lively atmosphere, noisy, bustling - that is what you should expect. i'm not going to go into details about what you should order, because everything (drinks and all) is going to be excellent. cheers to whatever the next venture rick will tackle, because it will be gooood.
