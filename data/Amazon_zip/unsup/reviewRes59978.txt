Entrana and Bandejo Paisa and Pollo - Oh My! Nothing to be afraid of here, Dorothy! Just great grilled steaks, pork, chicken and seafood! We tried a number of menu items, but can say we highly recommend the tender and juicy Entrana (skirt steak) or Bandejo Paisa (ribeye). Also, try the Pollo (chicken): pounded, marinated and grilled to perfection! As you enjoy the food, you'll appreciate their friendly and efficient service, as well as the comfortable, spacious seating and surroundings! "There's no place like home," I mean, like Las Tablas!
