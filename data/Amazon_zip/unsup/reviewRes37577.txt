Excellent neighborhood establishment. While they might be pricier, they do give great customer service. I've filled out the comment cards before and asked that the Sweet Potato Fries come back on the menu and for them to start selling La Croix and they did both things. I met the original owners Ari Fox and Ken Obel and have seen this mom and pop place evolve over several years. I love that their hours are 6am-12am every day. Only thing they could add is WiFi and faster service in the Cafe.
