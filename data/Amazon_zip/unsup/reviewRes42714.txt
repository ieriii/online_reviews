This place is great. I am ashamed I didn't try it sooner. All the pizzas are great and the special is a deal not to pass up. I was reluctant to try it because I thought it was a nail salon. I had never actually looked inside until one day I passed by, the door was open and the smell of pizza caught my attention. The ingredients they use are fresh. I like my dough a little crisiper but it's still really good. Perfect dough/sauce/cheese ratio. Not to mention they have three different kinds of pepperoni. It seems like every time I go I get a different kind of pizza.
