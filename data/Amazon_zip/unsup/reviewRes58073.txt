Right in China Town Square, this was a great place for lunch or dinner. Went there with a friend on a weekday afternoon. We were seated right away. Had a really good complimentary tea. We had fried rice, Three Chilli Chicken, and General Tso's Chicken. The portions were very generous, the chicken was cooked perfectly! Good use of spices and seasonings on the fried rice. The only negatives I found were a dirty table cloth,slow service, an extra charge for white rice and dated decor. But the great meal made up for all those things! Am defiantly going back to try the Peking Duck, heard its suppose to be the best in Chicago!
