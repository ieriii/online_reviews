I love this place! It's real - deal sichuan cooking, along with the more familiar menu items available too. Spicy cabbage will arrive as soon as you sit down, training your tongue for what is to come. The wait staff is well versed and is able to recommend more adventurous items you might not have had but will absolutely love. The wide ranging menu will guarantee that you find something great, from meat to fish to vegetarian.
