I absolutely love Geja's. I have been eating here for several years and my parents came here when they had just started dating over 25 years ago. I have never had a reason to write a review until now. I brought my mother and sister here for Mother's Day dinner and our night was MADE by our server Leah. She remembered my weird food allergy, was attentive, thoughtful and even laughed at my bad jokes. And holy crap I want to drink the cheese!
