I've been to Frontera twice and I've had two of the most memorable meals of my life there. The first time was about twelve years ago, around the holidays, and I can still remember everything I ate there. It was that good. In fact I was a little hesitant about going back for two reasons: First, how could it ever be that good again? And second, I looked at the online menu for the day we'd be there and honestly there wasn't anything that sounded really, really good to me.  Okay so maybe the margarita loosened me up a little, but I decided that I was going to try something new, and I tried the marlin ceviche. It was delicious! And the guacamole was as good as I'd remembered, so the appetizers? Clear winners. The second margarita convinced me that I was willing to try the pork in habanero flavored sauce and I'm glad I did because it was some of the best pork I'd ever eaten. The sauce was flavorful without being scary-hot. It really was perfect. I tried the pork ribs (a daily special) and the flank steak, and I was equally impressed with both, and with the sides.  Everything just worked. From the drinks and appetizers through the entrees to the desserts and coffee, everything was just right. The service was exactly the sort of unobtrusive care I like best. Our waiter and several other staff members were always nearby but never in our faces. We never had to ask for anything twice and in fact we rarely had to ask at all for things like refills. Why did I wait a dozen years to come back? Hard to say. But I know I'll be going back for my birthday; I already have the reservation. Believe me when I tell you that's one of the highest compliments I can pay a restaurant. I'm getting too old to waste my birthdays on just anyplace.
