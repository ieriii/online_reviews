I was disappointed in my experience at Carnivale. I heard so many great reviews so I was really excited about going. The atmosphere is great but the service and food was really bad. I had fish that was swimming in butter and oil. It was soggy and tasted terrible. My boyfriend had a steak that was super fatty and tough. It was disappointing to say the least. It is also very overpriced.
