Extremely impressed by the service, the food and Dale's creativity! My bf and I went with another couple Saturday night and decided to go with the $60 three course prix fixe option. I loved that there were so many options to choose from for each course. We sampled a few of the cocktails - who knew bourbon/ginger could taste so good? I went with the scallop as my first course... absolutely amazing. I love scallops but it was so neat how Dale added different flavors/textures with the peanuts and popcorn. In between the first and second course, they brought a mango-flavored ice, to cleanse the palate. Very tasty and different! I chose the lamb as my second dish. I skipped the anchovies but really enjoyed the baguette and the lamb was very well flavored and tasty. Between the second and third course, they brought us a fancier version of a grilled cheese... YUM! You can never go wrong with grilled cheese. Finally... dessert. Two of us went with the butternut and the other two went for the chocolate. Both.were.amazing! The butternut consisted of munchkin-like donut holes with butternut squash and a hint of curry. It was so delicious! We asked the waiter if Dale could come out and he did, which was awesome. He's super cool and very laid back. I highly recommend this restaurant... you will leave extremely satisfied!
