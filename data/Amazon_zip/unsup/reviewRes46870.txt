I've been waiting for this place to open as soon as I heard it was replacing the Supper Club that used to be there. Each day I walked the dog past and watched the progress. Then this week, little signs in the window: now open. So tonight, we went. For you Rogers Parkers who just haven't been completely satisfied with the restaurant selection within a few blocks of your house and have been jealous of your brothers and sisters a little south in Andersonville, Uncommon Ground is coming to the rescue. They've done a fantastic job creating a very cozy and inviting environment with three separate room: a bar that has about 8 stools and several cushioned chairs and a couch, a middle dining room area with larger tables, then a third room with tables that includes a small stage. Food is similar to the other uncommon ground (does this make it common?) so it's good. The only reason I'm not giving UG a 5th star is the prices. I'm cool with $15-20 entrees, and by the looks of what was coming out of the kitchen, you get plenty to eat, but over time they may need to offer a few more options sub $15 otherwise with the $8 beer (yes $8 for most draft selections) it can get pretty pricey quickly. Same with the wine list. Cheapest glass was $9. Overall though those are nickel and dime complaints - I'm looking forward to spending much time at this place. Kudos to the owners for willing to take a bit of a risk to open here. Let it be the genesis of more excellent dining in that corridor.
