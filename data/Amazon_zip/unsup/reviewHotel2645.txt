Love the James! The rooms are spacious, the beds are so comfy, and I thought the design touches (like all the lights are on dimmers) make the rooms feel pretty special. My room was on the top floor and at the end of the hall, so it was very quiet. I was able to check in (very) early, 11 am, which was great. Check out time is quite late, 2 pm, which was also great. Turndown service was unexpected and such a nice surprise! I had heard that there were Khiels toiletries, but there weren't... oh well. The room was very clean, and the service from everyone was great. I got a pretty low rate ($137) by booking through an Expedia blind deal. This is the main reason why I am giving 5 stars, because for that price I really doubt you can find anything better. There's a Starbucks and a Trader Joe's right across the street. Great location in general. There are many self-park garages very very close by too if you don't want to pay for valet (although I'm not sure how much money you'd be saving...)
