Last stop on my Bermuda Triangle of All-You-Can-Eat Brazilian Steakhouse: Fogo de Chao. The verdict? Fogo by a hair---4.5 stars. I guess I saved the best for last. "Dude, I love Fogo." On multiple occasions, I heard those four words during my visit two weeks ago. Fogo de Chao is commonly cited as THE churrascaria in Chicago Land. So this was as anticipated an event as Tyson vs Holyfield. Fogo certainly is a heavyweight champ. This place oozes masculinity: the restaurant is filled with 7 and 8 tops of dudes. Servers are corking magnums of Cabernet left and right. Charred slabs of beef are flying from table to table. This is where most men want to be when they die. Can't say that would be a bad call. Here's my churrascaria scorecard: Quality of Meat- A All meats have good marbling and are tender. The meat is very gamey with grass notes. This may not be to everyone's liking, but this meat pairs excellently with wine. Seasoning of Meat- B+ Most of the meat is modestly seasoned. However, I believe this is a deliberate decision. As a result, you really appreciate the meat's inherent flavors and the smokiness from the cooking method. Selection of Meats- A- Fogo offers plenty of cuts of beef with varying textures and flavors. The selection is skewed towards beef. That's not a bad thing considering the restaurant. Beef-centric is fine by me when it's done right. Frequency of Visits- A Fogo keeps em coming hot off the fire. Gluttony never felt so good. Salad Bar Selection- B+ Fogo has a solid selection. Artichokes, Asparagus, Reggiano Cheese, and smoked salmon are some highlights. Personally, I'll leave the salad bar to the amateurs. Give me the beef! Desserts- A No, I didn't have room for dessert. That's how good the desserts are! Tiramisu and Caramel Cheesecake are devilishly good. In fact, I think I will refer to this place as Devil de Chao. Mr. Devil says the business is beef. And business is good.
