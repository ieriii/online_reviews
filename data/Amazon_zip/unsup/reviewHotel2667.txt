You gotta love this boutique hotel. I do! And even though I live close enough to drive home- I've had the chance to stay here a few times and each time is better than the last. The service is impeccable. From checking in, to check out- everything is about you, the customer and I love that!  The last time I was there, they were out of standard rooms (so sad) and had to upgrade me to what they call a "loft" room. Truly lovely- with a separate sitting area with plasma tv, bar area and a bed that I couldn't seem to leave! Anyone know what is the maximum number of pillows that can be on a bed? As for having everything I wanted? Let's see . . .the rooms are stocked with Kiehl's products (nice), the J Bar is cool and contemporary and a great place to people watch, room service comes on time and the food is hot, and the bellmen must be trained to notice if you have everything you want and if you don't- they run and get it. Pretty nice. Ahh . . . .I'm thinking of moving in. Now if only I could find someone to pay for it!
