the location is awesome, the price is good but the hotel sucks! 1. i had booking for breakfast and they said i didnt...i am 100% sure i did...i mean even if i didnt have it i dont think the front desk should argue with me for half an hour and end up not giving it to me!2. the phone in my room was not working.3. the water in the shower kept getting cold and warm.4. the gym and sundick sucked. and the gym was close for "repairs" once i was trying to go.5. there was no hair dryer in the room and i had to go all the way to the front desk with wet hair to get it because the phone was not working.6. very very very old crapy place and very rude front desk people.'7. the hood in the kitchen didnt work. 8. the housekeeper kept wanted to clean my room every morning at 8 am..i mean come on ..some people come to hotels to relax in their vacation and they shouldnt wake them up at 8 am everyday!Over all if you are able to spend a little more per night to get a better place , DO IT!
