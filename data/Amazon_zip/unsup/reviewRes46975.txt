I don't want to drop a 5-spot on this place, I'm beginning to think I'm too easy doling these things out. But I had brunch at this second edition Uncommon Ground on Sunday and it won on every count: Food: Silly good. Lemon-ricotta pancackes topped with blueberries were light, flavorful, delicious! My wife's chopped chicken club salad was light on the dressing -- their incredible sundried tomato ranch -- but our server was lightening quick with an extra serving. Bloody mary's are whipped up with garlic-infused vodka and are perfectly seasoned. Service: What a happy place! From the greeters who invited us to hang out at the bar and enjoy our cocktails (the place was rocked for brunch), to the bartender who asked how we were -- no, not "do you need drinks" how are you, but really just wanted to see how our days was going -- to our server, who saw we biked in and struck up a conversation about biking 'round chicago. Nice people! And it translated to our meal, where our orders were turned around in a flash, our table was bussed when we weren't looking and even an extra iced tea came off the bill. Ambiance: Beautiful, cozy space. From the fireplace, to the lodge-like fireside seating at the bar, to the mellow jazz band playing live during our meal. The restaurant is eye candy, with gritty paintings of urban life covering the walls. It does get a hair loud in there on a Sunday (especially if you're "recovering"), an they do cram a big crowd in. I was shoved into my table by a neighboring chair behind me. More his fault than the restaurant's, though (come on, people, observe the world around you!). Extra Credit: A free parking lot for a hot brunch place in Chicago?!? WTF??? That'll be handy when the parents come to town.
