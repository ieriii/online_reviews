A group of us went to Shaw's for their oysters. We had a great time there and the oysters were fresh and tasted excellent with the champagne vinaigrette and cocktail sauce. The service was excellent - we never had to wait long to ask for another drink or plate of oysters. The next time I get a oyster craving, I will defintely go to Shaw's.
