This is my favorite sushi joint. And it's BYOB, which always wins points in my book. I have never had anything from here that was sub-par.  Often they have fatty toro, fatty hamachi or fatty salmon. All of these things are incredible. Their oysters are delicious. I always want more of their ginger salad. Their specials are always interesting. I'm never afraid of trying something new here.  And you can eat and eat and eat and eat and you won't spend a ton of money. Now, keep in mind, that any good sushi is somewhat pricey; however, the quality is supurb. And it's worth the amount on your check. I even got my husband liking sushi by taking him here. I call that a win for me.  I recommend a reservation because they get pretty busy.
