Great atmosphere, we actually sat at one of the bar tables without a reservation. Started with unique cocktails from the martini list, then popcorn drizzeled with truffle oil, Parmesan, and pepper.  We did the tasting of the new spring menu (suplemented by a few of our own choices). It was fantastic ... We loved the Wagyu, sashimi dish and the shortbreads. You can skip the Caesar ... others in our party loved the pea soup. This place is sort of a deconstruction of fantastic dishes.  All in all, it was a 2 and a half hour experience and we loved it ... That said, it is not the place to go if you are in a rush, but we had a wonderful evening. They even sell belt buckles? Would highly recommend ...
