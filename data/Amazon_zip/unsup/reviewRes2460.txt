Genius. Absolute genius.  Doug's encased meats are ethereal. Sad the mountain man was not available...antelope just fine today... If you're worried about the line, it may be shorter on a cold day. I always go when I have time, line or not. Once the thought of a gourmet sausage enters my mind, there's no turning back. Doug is the best. I once saw him tell a guy "cash only," and instead of making him go get cash, he wrote up an IOU on notebook paper! An IOU? Seriously?! If only all people were that nice!
