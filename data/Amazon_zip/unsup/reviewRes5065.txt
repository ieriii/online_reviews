Salt roasted beets and whipped goat and pistacios delicious and actually filling. Get something light with that dish. I also ordered the Mortadella which was surprisingly good. Was there for a packed lunch crowd during the week, looking forward to back in the evening to enjoy the good selections of wine and drafts. As for the decor, when you walk in you get this feeling that you've left the US and landed in Europe somewhere.
