This is my new favorite. Its inexpensive ($8-12 per person) and BYOB. Right accross the street from the Western brownline stop, so convenient location. I order the Peanut Lovers with Chicken with mild spices. it was awesome. Large servings and was enough for an entire meal the next day. Service was average nothing to brag about. Decor was nice.
