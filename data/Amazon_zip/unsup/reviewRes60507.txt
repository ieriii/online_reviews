I don't know how this place could be called a gastropub. Sure the menu reads well, and sounds pretty, but when the food comes, man what a let down. First off, the server came to take our drink order, and I asked if they had Knob Creek, (yeah, I'm a girl who likes her whiskey) the server replied no, we don't carry that on tap. Ok, go check then. The appetizers came out and the wings were just ok, but the entrees came out (35 min later) and what a let down. Soggy bread, and bland sauce. Oscar would be ashamed.
