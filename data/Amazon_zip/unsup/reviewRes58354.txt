We had the 8 courses menu.very disappointing experience.The baked potato was very average - the cheese and cracker was simply bad and we couldn't finish it... definitely a lack of flavor in most of the ingredients. The trout was just ok, probably a bit too cooked.Some of the chocolates were just awful - the white one was tasting like a piece of butter.A third of the restaurant was empty - weird when you think how difficult it is to get a reservation.deconstructive cuisine requires a real talent... otherwise it looks like very very pretentious.Service was very average as well (keep your bottle on the table or you'll have to ask more than once to be served).The only thing we finally enjoyed is our wine - yes, it's great, it's a BYOB.For a much better experience, go to North Pond!!!
