Beet and Ricotta Ravioli with a hint of poppy seed - now THAT's what I'm talkin' about!  Loved the creativity of the menu, though heavy on the meat side.  I would be thrilled to see this place get a few more vegetarian primo e secondi piatti on the menu.  The delicate rosamarino breadsticks were 'lish, the bottle of schioppettino wine - mmmmmmm, and the chocolate cake, well.  let me just say this: it caused a chocogasm.  yes it did.  And the well thought out starters includes farro, with grilled radicchio, horseradish, pecorino... and my favorite, caponata, a sicilian eggplant relish with pine nuts!  You can order a sampling of 8 starters for $15 !  That's more than dinner for two right there.  Hot date on a budget.  Next time though, I'm going to try the apple fennel bread pudding! Sounds amazing.  Mama would be proud to dine here - and I'd love to give Anteprima one more star if only they add a few more vegetarian options!  Very cute space with a nice bar, but tables are crammed in here super tight, so check your coat.  Mannaggia calda !
