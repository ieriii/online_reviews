I made a reservation but still ended up waiting about 20 minutes. That's ok I guess, but just a heads up. It was around 830pm so it was pretty packed and busy. I had a groupon that was expiring in a week so I decided it was time to use it.  Once we got seated we quickly decided to get the messob for two. We started out with some honey wine cause we've heard so many good things about it. For apps, we got the vegi sambussas. Think samosas that are a little bit softer. YUM. The spicy sauce was excellent, and I kept dipping even though it was pretty spicy.  For our combo, we got the mixed which is 3 veggie and 3 meat portions. I don't remember the names, but we got the red lentil, spinach, and cabbage/carrots for veg. For meats we ordered one of each, but again, I don't really remember. The chicken came with eggs and dry cottage cheese. The lamb was the non spicy of the two choices, and the beef was the spicy one. Next time I'll pay more attention. Either way, they were all delicious. We couldn't finish it all, and we knew we were getting some dessert so we saved our bellies. The dessert we chose was the Ethiopian fruit and bread dish. It was kinda like a bread pudding type of bread with a mixture of mango, grapes, and some other fruit. Was pretty good, light, not too heavy. All in all, it was a good experience. Service was not too slow even though it was packed.  All in all with the groupon the total came out to $9. Plus the $20 I spent on the groupon itself. Not too bad, and it was enough for leftovers a couple days later. Now if the drive from the burbs wasn't so long I'd be back more often, but either way, I'll be back... someday.
