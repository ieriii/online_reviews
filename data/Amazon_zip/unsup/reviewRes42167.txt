Service was just ok. I got it to go and it took a little while for it to be prepared, esp. since I just ordered Pho. The flavor was pretty good, portions were big. But my big complaint was that the meat was extremely fatty and tough. It's bad when you're throwing out a quarter pound of gross tough beef fat. I'd probably just stick only brisket. I got all three types of beef.
