When you have over 2,000 independently owned hot dog stands in the city of Chicago, it may seem silly to travel out of the way and stand in line for an hour just to try another hot dog. However, Hot Doug's turns out more than just another hot dog--this is a "Sausage Superstore and Encased Meat Emporium!" From your simple Chicago Dog to a truffle-infused chicken sausage, you can't really make a wrong decision here. I have even tried the Vegetarian dog, and for a place that specializes in meats, even the veggie option left me satisfied. Conclusion: Go to Hot Doug's and use the time spent waiting in line to make up your mind between whether you want an Alligator, Snake, or Foie Gras dog--or maybe you should get all three...
