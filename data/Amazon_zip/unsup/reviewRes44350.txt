I really like the sushi here but the service is really, really bad. I've been here a ton. It's the only sushi place my husband can stand anymore, because he thinks we get it way too much. Every time I go, it's the same thing - tons of waitresses standing around talking, not taking our order or re-filling our drinks. It seems like they have some kind of system of not assigning any waitress to your table, so in the end, no one takes responsibility. I know I'll be back here but ugh, get it together!
