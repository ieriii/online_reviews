We went here on our last trip to attend our daughter's graduation and obviously went in with high expectations -- in terms of inventiveness, those expectations were met, but in terms of food, there was a great deal of inconsistency. It was a culinary experience, but I found some of the selections were more gimmicky than anything else (for example, the leaf that was supposed to taste like an oyster etc..). Most disappointing was the chocolate desert which was more of a show which I got bored after a few scoops. All in all, my suggestion for a better meal in Chicago would be Sprout for a true tasty dinner.
