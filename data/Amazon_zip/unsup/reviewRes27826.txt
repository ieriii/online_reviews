We tried a pan sausage pizza and had it delivered, so I can't speak to the restaurant, but the pizza was decent. I definitely don't understand the massive following this place gets, the pizza was good, but nothing special.. to me it was like a higher quality pizza hut pan pizza. I knew it was going to have a lot of bread going in, but damn, the pizza itself is 90% bread. If you cut the cheese and sauce and toppings off and put it in a plate, it'd be 1/8" thick. The sausage was very good and they give you great portions.. I really liked the burnt cheese on the crust, that was probably my favorite part. Overall it's a decent, and quality pizza. In a city famous for the deep dish, their pan style is a nice change of pace.
