I gotta say...Garcia's is one instance when my fellow yelpers let me down. I thought the food was really pretty mediocre. I was really cravin some quesadillas, and my favorite Mexican place, Los Noplaes (which, incidentally, i did discover through yelp, and its like a couple blocks away from Garcia's and SO MUCH BETTER) was closed on Monday. Boo Monday. Anyways, I did a quick yelp check, and Garcia's got good reviews so we called them up and ordered take out. I ordered mushroom and onion quesadillas and they told me they didn't have mushrooms :( What? No mushrooms. Fine. Veggie Fajitas, and my dining companions had chicken tacos and carne tacos. I also got some extra rice and beans. Word was the chicken was dry, the carne was better and the guac was pretty good but no Los Nopales.  Bottom line was, could it be the margaritas that make this food so "amazing?"  At Los Nopales I know its the food that's really amazing and not the liquor, because they don't serve any!!! Its BYOB and I always forget to, and the food is terrific just the way it is... So go there instead. Just not on a Monday.
