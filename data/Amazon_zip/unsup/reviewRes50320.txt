Was visiting a friend who lives in Wicker Park and we decided to make a pit stop here and watch the Bears game last weekend. We planned poorly :\ We should have gotten there around 10am and we would've gotten a seat but since we arrived at 1pm (game was at 2), we ended up standing the whole time. But I have to say, the layout is pretty cool. It has 3 floors and a great crowd. We even ended up talking to the manager and got a few shots on the house :) I would love to try their food next time I'm in town but for the atmosphere it was an A+
