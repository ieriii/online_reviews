I was here once five years ago and last night for a birthday party. Now I remember why I never came back. We were there for a birthday celebration and waited 1 hour past our reservation which is completely ridiculous. There are some places that I would wait an hour for and this is not that place. If it weren't for the fact that this is what the birthday girl wanted to do, I would have walked out. The place is vibrant and bustling so at least it was an interesting wait with good people watching. A lot of wanna be people, suburbanites and probably tourists. They didn't have one of the wines on the menu. Who runs out of wine on a Saturday night? The bartender of course recommends a bottle similar but $20 more. We finally got seated, well over an hour after we got there and they gave us complimentary guacamole and chips-2 little bowls for 12 people. The servers are lucky they still have all their fingers. We were so hungry. We were like a school of piranhas. They were gone in seconds. I will pay them the only complement that is worthy- the guac was AMAZING. But not amazing enough for me to come back and re live that ordeal again. They took forever to take our orders but the food did come out relatively quick. I had the short rib which was mediocre at best. The only flavor that I tasted was salt, too much of it. The polenta under it was delicious and creamy but there wasn't a lot of it. All in all, this is not my thing. With Restaurant Row on Randolph down the street, I don't know why I would waste my time here- unless someone I love and adore wants to go for their birthday. It was packed too. I just don't get it. Maybe it was everyone's birthday last night.
