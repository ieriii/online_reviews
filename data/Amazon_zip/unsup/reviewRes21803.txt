I had plans to go to dinner here with a group of people and since I've recently become addicted to yelping everything, I was super excited to try it because of the great reviews. I was not impressed.  Maybe it wasn't great because the party was large, but I will say that the waitress was awesome. There were a ton of us, and she was very attentive all night. Ok, the frozen strawberry margaritas were terrible. I don't know if they had any alcohol in them. For the amount of money they cost, I had hoped that they would, but I certainly couldn't tell. The food - was mediocre at best. I had a combination plate so I could try a little of each ( I love Mexican food and was hoping to find a new go-to place) the tamales and tacos were very dry and not exciting. The place is also very noisy.  And can someone please explain to me why cops was playing on the tv in the back dining room? Cops? Really? I didn't know that show was still on.
