Homemade pasta, great service, exposed brick walls with warm colors for a trendy atmosphere, and great location. We tried the caprese salad, the avocado spread on warm, crunchy toasts, sprinkled with mozzarella, the scallop linguini dish, and the lobster stuffed pasta. All of these dishes were outrageously delicious. They also serve you fresh, crusty bread with oil and a bowl of parmesan. This place is wonderful and I can't wait to go back!
