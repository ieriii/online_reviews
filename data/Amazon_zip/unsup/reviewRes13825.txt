Very tasty! I had the Cuban sandwich and took half of it home for lunch the next day. The guy behind the counter was very helpful in making suggestions if you weren't familiar with Cuban food. I've tried to go back a few times with my boyfriend but it has been packed and we were too hungry to wait. For sure going back though!
