GREAT SPICY SZE CHUAN FOOD!I have been here a few times and I have to mention that the level of spicy-ness (sp?) has not been consistent, but nonetheless, it is still good. I recommend the Tony's chicken. I wasn't expecting anything really special when I ordered it for the first time, but it is on my must order list now. Service is very sporadic. If you catch them when it's less busy, service is ok. On a busy day, it will be hard to get their attention. But trust me, the food is worth it, since they're not actually rude.Note: Most dishes are spicy so it may not be suitable for children.
