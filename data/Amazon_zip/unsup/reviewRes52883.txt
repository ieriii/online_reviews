The food, ambience, and service were all outstanding. Surprisingly good vegetarian options. And for once I was able to eat Cuban food without a small wyvern perching on my shoulder and whispering to me the secret events that would come to bring about the end of life on Earth. We got a seat by the fireplace, which made for a particularly cozy and intimate meal.
