The beer selection is very good! You can try many craft beers here. I am a big fab of stouts, and they have Founders breakfast stout (mmmm!), and that crazy Russian style stout (be careful - it is very high in alcohol ;) but very yummy), and many more other nice beers. I have not tried food there - since I always come in after 11pm, and, alas, the kitchen is closed after 11 (as in many other bars :( [but whyyyy? people are still hungry after 11 pm...). In any case - I cannot comment on food, but beers are awesome. Also the bar's atmosphere itself is urban yet cozy, with awesome industrial style iron-wood-n-leather artwork on the walls. Nice place to sip on some fancy beer ;)
