Just like my roommate says, the chicken is laced with crack. I have the fortune of literally being around the corner away from this wonder. The chicken is definitely on the pricey side compared to other fried chicken joints (and those in Korea), but the price premium is worth it. A half-chicken can easily feed 2-3 people. If you order 5-piece wings, the wings are so huge that you'll feel full after 2-3 pieces. Usually, I order chicken with the bibimbap and split it with a friend. The owners are super-friendly and will help you if you're not sure what you want to get. The place is very small but cozy with the communal picnic tables. They deliver as well.
