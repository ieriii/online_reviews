I brought my boyfriend to Bon Soiree for his birthday dinner, off of two groupons.Verdict:1) amuse-bouche: excellent2) salad with figs and truffle oil: Ok, bland3) 'campfire' in a beef box (apple and smoked bacon): honestly would have been just as happy with my hometown bbq4) equivalent to butternut squash soup: VERY tasty5) 5 different kinds of eggplant with lobster: lobster good, but how hard is that to do, eggplants ; nothing special, bland6) equivalent to beef stroganoff: I don't want you to mimic beef stroganoff firstoff. Wagyu beef was decent, though one of my pieces was the fatty end. Overall the combination of foods, especially the creme fraiche did not sit well.7) cheese- this was pretty good, but really? this counts as a course?8) homemade graham cracker with scallop marshmallow- probably my least favorite, behind the beef stroganoff. Unfortunately ending this way with a salty(Scallop) marshmallow really did not sit well with me. And dessert is my favorite food!The positives are that it's BYO.The service was pretty good (they did almost everything right but the servers' level of professionalism was not on par with other fine dining restaurants) EXCEPT1) though I reminded our waiter it was my boyfriend's birthday, she forgot the candles!!!! :(2) I was told over the phone they would accept two groupons for the meal and instead rejected one at the meal. (1 per table) not cool.Ambiance: cold and modern (loft look, exposed brick/heater pipes), relatively quiet and nice for a date. So overall, food was alright, nothing stellar. And you've got to wow me at least on one dish for a $75/person tasting menu.
