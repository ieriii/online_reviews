Tank Noodle is my go-to Vietnamese restaurant in town. I appreciate their solid and consistent meals and good service. I've ordered the Pho, shrimp omlette, papaya salads, and fruit smoothies with tapioca, and have never been disappointed. I come from the West Coast where I was spoiled with an over-abundance of Asian food choices so I may be a harsh critic in saying that theirs is not the best or perfection, and is a tad overpriced, but it's about as good as it gets here in Chicago.
