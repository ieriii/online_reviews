There's never a shortage of good restaurants in Chicago. We have Charlie Trotters, Alinea, L2O etc but Tru is an old school classic for fine dining. It's as representative of Chicago as Bears in sports or the Sears Tower in architecture. When my friends came to visit, I had to bring them there. We went on a Sunday night. The decor was very modern and sharp, just what I expected. Once we were seated, we immediately noticed that we were a little out of place. Our table of 20 somethings were surrounded by older customers, who were in their 50s or 60s, dressed in business attire. I felt a tiny bit intimidated. The service was very formal, I thought. A little pretentious if you ask me, with all the synchronized serving by our two servers or the way they spoke to us. I felt like a commoner trapped in the body of Louis VI. The tasting menu was excellent and lavish but not a whole lot of surprises. I was not getting a taste of Tramanto/Gale Gand's creations like I expected. Perhaps it was not a very good idea to have gone to Alinea the night before. Tru was very good but just pale in comparison. Then I realized, Tru was just not the same anymore. It's not the Tru that Gale/Rick made famous. I wished I could turn back time.
