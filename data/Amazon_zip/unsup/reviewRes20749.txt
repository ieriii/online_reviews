Man this place was bad and reminds me I can't always trust yelp and why I keep going back to trying to find newpaper reviews. Yes maybe this place has a "good" scene for bucktown but the sushi was gimmicky and not that high of quality. Not sure where people are coming from but if you want to byob and pose and eat raw fish this is a great place for someone that doesn't go out a lot. Its like a cool trendy sushi place like some people think applebys/chilis is a good restaurant.
