Mmmmmmmm Thank GOD for Rick Bayless!!!!! I went here because my roommate has been spewing her love for XOCO and Rick Bayless for months, and finally when a friend was in town I found an excuse to go. That was two weeks ago and I've been there 3 more times, each time with another friend who also became as enamored with XOCO as I am! So far I've had the classic hot chocolate (oh so good. can't wait to have it in winter) and the churros, every time (delicious when hot! not too greasy. perfect.) and the choriqueso (twice!) and gunthorp chicken (really spicy). Here's a tip: When there's a long line to sit in the restaurant, and the weather is nice, I like to take my food to go (never a line) and walk 2 blocks to the river and sit and watch the sun set over the river and city as I eat my delicious cuisine. Magnificent! Can't wait for winter so I can have churros and hot chocolate as much as my budget allows!
