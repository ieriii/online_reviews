No quiero Taco Bell. Yeah. I said it. Screw you, talking chihuahua. You know what else I'm going to say? Garcia's knows what's up. They know food and the managers know how to keep people happy. Over the past half ao, I've been to Garcia's about cinco times and I've had some, overall, good experiences. I've tried a little bit of everything and here's what I really thought stood out: -Chips & salsa: Crunchy, spicy, and FREE! =) -Fish tacos: When I was younger, I always acknowledged fish tacos as one of the most disgusting foods ever. Let me just say that the fish tacos at Garcia's are absolutely awesome. Tilapia, not breaded, with great flavor and texture. -Flautas: among the best that I've found in the city The food is well portioned and nicely priced. If you aren't a big eater, you'll be happy to know that you're going home with leftovers. Servicio is A-Okay. Nothing special...except the managerial staff. From my experience, they are quite polite and are willing to help customers as needed. One of the nicest things that a manager has done for me is close the door/window things that allow for an "outdoor" eating experience. It was a chilly night and I was dining with my lady friend. We were sat in the bar area next to the door/window things and left there for a while, cold. Wait staff left us on our own because it was packed in the restaurante. Managers apologized for the wait and offered to close the door/window things. Little things like that are nice. Overall, I like the place. It also helps that they're open crazy late. The last thing I'll say is: Dnde est la biblioteca?
