Top notch establishment that serves both great food and drinks. Fun atmosphere that works well for group gatherings, provided you make reservations ahead of time. The servers are a helpful, if not eclectic, bunch who will eagerly and expertly answer questions as vague as, "what do you recommend on the drink menu?" Everything on the menu I tried was excellent and I recommend sticking with the meats, as that is what they are known for. My group decided to share everything, which was a wise move. Also, the bathrooms are really neat. Just sayin'.
