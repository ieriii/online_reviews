I'm writing a much overdue follow up. After writing my initial review, the manager immediately contacted me, asked for my name and found it on their list of credits. She apologized and promptly sent a gift certificate. We haven't been back yet, I of course lost the certificate, but will definitely give them another try in the future. My big gripe on my initial review was the lack of customer service, they definitely turned that around. Mistakes happen and I forgive. Looking forward to giving them another shot!
