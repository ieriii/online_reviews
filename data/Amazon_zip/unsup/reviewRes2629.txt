Loved it. Showed up at 10:40 a.m. on a Saturday and had to wait an hour. It was fine. I wouldn't have done it if it had been really cold out. My wife and I got a chicago dog, a brat, and 2 of the specialty dogs, plus duck fat fries. All the dogs were excellent and reasonably priced. The owner is just about as nice a guy as there is out there. I was not blown away by the duck fat fries, and they left a greasy taste in my mouth the rest of the day. Definitely would be back, and definitely a great place to take out-of-towners for a true taste of Chicago.
