A solid place - 3.5 stars is appropriate, but Yelp has not yet evolved to permit such ratings. Thankfully, we went on a Sunday afternoon so we had no wait. But if you have to wait past 1/2 hour, I'd go somewhere else.  To the food... We did it right and ordered 8 plates for the 4 of us.  Apps Cauliflower steak - the lemon on this was really strong. I wouldn't get it again.  Seared Hearts of Palm - solid, but boring (a poor order... but I didn't say anything).  Crispy Pork Belly with Apple Mastrada - the apple mastrada was really good. I found myself relying on that instead of using it to compliment the pork belly, but it was a good dish. Probably not for most people as this was less refined than most pork belly dishes that are so popular right now in other Chicago places.  Squash salad - the best dish of the night. Everything about this dish was great. The goat cheese is prevalent but it works for me.  Mains Swordfish - it was only disappointing because it was boring, but the fish was well seasoned and perfectly cooked. Probably a weak order. Risotto Carbonara - solid but somewhat boring again. Sea Urchin and Crab Linguine - very heavy on the seafood, so most people will love it. I did not, but others at the table did. Very rich, so beware. Polenta with Pork Cheek Ragu - my favorite main dish. They mix it at the table, which is a nice touch. But I don't care about that if the food sucks. Thankfully, this was excellent.  The desciptions may lack detail, but honestly, this was simple food. Solid food too.  Personally, I'll always be perplexed with the American fascination with Italian food. This was good food, but all of it can be cooked at home! I'm not sure why people wait 2+ hours, but alas, Scott Harris knows what he's doing (he's turned the mediocre Francesca's into a modern Italian/American empire).  Give it a try if you're in the area, but stay away during busy time. And I wouldn't go out of my way.
