We went to La Villa after ordering takeout and enjoying their food, as good as it can be for take out. We have tried many Italian places in the city, some fantastic and some we should have skipped. You can always tell by the bread how your meal will be. La Villa had great ambiance when we walked in. Cute and quaint but plenty of table space. Oil and cheese on the table which is always a must for us. They had a nice wine and drink selection and cozy bar area. The staff were professional and efficient but personable. The focaccia bread was the best I have ever had and the caramelized garlic spread they brought to the table was great and a nice touch. We had the antipasto, not the best we have had but still good and a very large amount of food. The chicken rice soup was creamy and flavorful. We ordered the gnocchi and beef stroganoff (not on the menu for the night but they made it anyway). The portions were huge and most was taken home. Finally we tried the tiramisu, pretty standard but a good way to end the evening. La Villa is that neighborhood Italian restaurant that has good food, great ambiance, a large selection, and reasonable prices. It is all that I would wish to find in a Chicago restaurant. We will definetly be back. Did I mention that on the Sunday we went, there was a gentleman walking around making balloon animals? Other nights, live music....great times!
