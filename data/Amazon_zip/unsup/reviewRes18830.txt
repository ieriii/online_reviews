XOCO was OK. I went with my cousin for a late work day lunch at the recommendation of a co-worker. Since we dropped in around 2 p.m. we didn't have to wait very long, but despite the lull it was way too loud for a conversation without shouting. We ordered the caldos and they were also OK, but not anything mind-blowing and way over-priced for what is essentially soup. Perhaps we ordered the wrong thing, but with so many awesome food choices in Chicago, I don't plan to XOCO anytime soon.
