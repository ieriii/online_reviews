The pizza wasn't very good. I'd write a really long review here, but I went in expecting something more than I got. Also, they were out of all the beers they had on the menu that looked good. I asked the waitress for an IPA and she suggested Stella Artois...really? Ate half the pizza between 2 of us, boxed it up, and threw the rest away later. Also expensive.
