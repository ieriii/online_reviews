This place has become part of our rotation. I usually get the buffalo skirt steak. What an amazing dish that is. (Leave the spicy stuff to the side and regulate how much each bite gets. If you apply too much to the steak, it can be overwhelming.) I cant' say that I see this dish everyday, that's for sure. I miss the gamay from the wine list (apparently I was one of the few that drank it there), but I found a more than suitable replacement in the Valpolicella. I think they take their wine list pretty seriously at this place, anyway. There are a few more on that list that I want to try. The one time I went for brunch I had the uncommon breakfast melt. Very solid. Dinner is really what this place is about, though.
