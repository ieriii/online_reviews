The Marriott had some really great plusses, especially location-wise, but I just wasn't a huge fan given these reasons: 1) Rooms were small with full sized beds. 2) I hated the fact they had two sets elevators - one that went to the higher floors and another set that went from 1-28. I'm sure there is an excellent logistical reason for why they did that, but it was a pain if we wanted to visit other people in our party. 3) No mini-fridge in OUR room at least (we found others had mini-fridges in their rooms) but their rooms had one bed as opposed to two? Perhaps that was the difference? 4) Small bathrooms. Not to mention, our toilet kept running the entire night. 5) We had luke-warm water the last morning we were there. 6) SMALL pool with a smaller fitness center (but the weight room was located in a different location which was quite spacious). Though all in all, the Marriott was a pretty nice place to stay. They had a real Starbucks in their lobby (but its not 24 hour). Free wifi on the 2nd floors and lobby. The food offered in the hotel was also REALLY good. We had a banquet there and the food was exceptional. They utilize farm fresh products and even have beehives on the roof, producing their own honey! Not to mention, the LOCATION was absolutely amazing. We were within walking distance of the art institute of chicago, the bean, as well other great Chicago attractions (ahem the food?!).
