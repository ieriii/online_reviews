What a great deal for some tasty, tasty food! Went with a group for an early dinner last Saturday. The floor was greasy as expected, but didn't bother me all that much. The service was excellent - everyone very nice and welcoming.  The chips and salsa were great. They also brought us some chicken soup to start with a whole wing in it...wasn't quite sure how to eat it, but it tasted good. I had the Enchiladas Suizas with chicken. Good with a little heat. Comes with rice and beans for only $6! What a deal! Everyone enjoyed their meals, and we'll definitely be back.
