Thanks to the yelpers I found this Greek heaven. It is absolutely delicious! I use to think Daphne's was pretty good but now my standards are higher after going here. They have wonderful combination plates (see photo) for those who want a bit of everything. The hummus sampler is a must. The price for two lunch dishes, appetizer & no alcohol is approx $45. Worth every penny! And close to the metro. Yipee!
