Lovely room, pleasant wait staff. I went for brunch and decided to have the steak and eggs. The description made it sound very good. Unfortunately, the menu did not mention that the steak was encased in a doughy hush puppy. I would not have ordered it had I known that. One of my companiions ordered the hash and fared much better. A generous portion and seemingly as described on the menu. Another companion had the salmon and was quite satisfied. I will go back for a second try however.
