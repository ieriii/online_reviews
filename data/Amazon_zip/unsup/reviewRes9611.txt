My first time here for dinner this week; service was extremely good - The 2 appetizers I had were terrific - soup w/ crabmeat & aspargus and  chao tom - shrimp wrapped around sugar cane with mint, cilantro and a great peanut/plum dipping sauce. I had the ga nuong xa (chicken w/ lemongrass) as an entree- it was very good; but, nothing to rave about. I'll be back here next time I'm in Chicago!
