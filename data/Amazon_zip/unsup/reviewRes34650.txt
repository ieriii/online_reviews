I had a small birthday party at this joint five years ago, and just recently got to stop by for lunch. This little place still cranks out hits and does so with a casual flair that I love. Chef Daniel has been there for 10 years, and he was super attentive to our lunch group. He gave special Korean side dishes to our vegan friends. Lunch boxes came with a yummy salad and miso soup.  The Thai stick roll was the most innovative roll/taste experience I've had in a maki roll for a long time. Big points for that since we are now living in such a blah maki roll world where everything is covered in siracha mayo and tempura bits. Nice job! BYOB.
