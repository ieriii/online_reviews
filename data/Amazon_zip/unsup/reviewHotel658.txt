Check in was fine.. I had such a long day, I couldn't wait to take a nice hot shower/bath. I stepped into my room to find a used washcloth in the middle of the entryway. Nasty! I also found a used napkin in the minibar tray! Gross!! There isn't a tub, only a shower. Low and behold the hotel gives me a handicap accessible room that has one of those removable shower heads. The shower head is stuck in the lowest position. I hate those removable shower heads, especially if you have to fight with it to stay in place, much less try to keep the shampoo from getting in your eyes. I couldn't get the locking mechanism to stay in place, so I called to ask if they would change my room. She said unfortunately, we are sold out and I will call maintenance to fix the shower head. A half an hour later after 2 trips and 2 men, the shower was finally fixed. The bathroom looked run-down to me. The mirror was broken and jimmy rigged to the wall; the seal in the shower area was worn and coming off. The floor I was on was pretty noisy and I checked in pretty late, like 11pm. Also, I went to the hotel website to pull the spec sheet, which is right on on the website notes a "hot breakfast bar". No such luck! Know before you go.. no breakfast offered other than room service or the bagel shop downstairs.
