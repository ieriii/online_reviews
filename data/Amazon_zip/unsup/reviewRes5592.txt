I love this place. Tucked away off the mile, which I usually abhor going to. Best late at night, when the crowd is gone, and you can sit at the bar stools with your date and chat with the sommelier and the staff, and they'll tell you their favorite cheeses, and make recommendations, and because it's that time of the night, and they keep this kinship towards you, will pour you more than your allotted portion of wine, and let you taste other wines, and finish off other opened bottles. They're super friendly, and having come straight here from salute wine bar, this was a great way to end the night.
