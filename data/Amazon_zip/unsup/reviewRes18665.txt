Just like most "gourmet" sausage shops draw comparisons to Hot Doug's, most gourmet burger joints draw comparisons to Kuma's Corner so I guess I'll start there. Is Bad Apple the next Kuma's? Not quite, but getting closer. Does Bad Apple make a bad-ass burger? I'd definitely say yes. I still haven't had a burger I didn't like here, and my only previous gripe was with the french fries which I found a bit bland and overfried. On my most recent visit (which was actually a carryout order) I had the awesome Belly Burger which featured a generous helping of delicious braised pork belly on top of the burger. I'm guessing the pork belly spent a little time on the griddle before topping the burger, as it had some nice touches of char/crispness which helped deepen its flavor. Don't expect the saltiness of bacon, this is just some straight up porky goodness. The house cut fries were also much tastier and fried spot on this time around. Overall this is a great spot for some creative burgers, and they have a wide beer selection to boot. 4.5 stars would be about right, but I'll round that down to 4 until they nix the up-charge on the pretzel bun and make it standard. I love me some pretzel bun.
