I've been here a few times. Frontera had a 5-star standing with me for a while, but after my last experience it dropped one star. I've had a variety of duck, fish, and pork dishes here. The flavors are always so interesting and complex. The cocktails are ALWAYS incredible. I credit Frontera for helping me to overcome my fear of tequila, which is fun. I also love the space inside - bright and inspiring. Some of my best meals there have been at the bar when the wait was too long for a table. The bar has such a good energy! Reason for the star drop: I ordered a rib special sometime in June. The flavors were pretty good, but a little too spicy (and I LOVE spice) and the meat was super dry. Surprisingly dry. Later on, I saw Rick Bayless eating his own rack of ribs at a nearby table, and almost wanted to ask him - "hey, are yours dry too? is this how you wanted them to taste?" Love this place too much to hold the dry rib incident against them for too long, but I definitely won't forget it.
