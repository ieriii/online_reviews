I cannot tell you how great this place is everytime I go there. Thursday night, party of 7 and the chef took the time to give us a tour of the kitchen which was great. Of course the food is the best and the atmosphere unbelievable. This is probably my 10th time there and I continue to take clients and friends. A great place for any reason and I highly recommend.
