Things I loved about Little Bucharest: - The atmosphere was welcoming and warm. - Absolutely, hands down, the most delicious borscht I've ever had. It was tangy and sweet at the same time, and little bread crumbs on top made it a filling soup. - The sausage appetizer with fried polenta was excellent. Not so great: - Wine and drink pours were pretty teeny. I don't think I got a full 5 oz of the house red in my glass. - The entrees were overpriced. Thank God we had the Groupon because three drinks, an appetizer, a soup and one shared entree ended up costing us $80! - The restaurant automatically charged the tip, which seems to be a trend with Groupon users. I'm not loving that. I almost always add at 20% tip for service anyway, because I know how much work it is, but I don't like it being forced on me with a dinner for two. - The stuffed chicken thigh, which was "required ordering" since they won a Time Out award for it a few years back, did not wow me. I found the chicken and polenta to be too mushy, and the tomato sauce to taste generic, almost like Pace Picante salsa! It was a little disappointing.
