Just what the hotel reviews said, a 4 Star quality hotel and they are correct. This place was perfect for a stay in Chicago. A bit further away from downtown but nothing the Train can't solve. The comfort of the room was amazing, very nice beds, room can go pitch black so you get no sunlight, and the cleanliness of the place is spectacular. I didn't notice all the shops they have down under till the next morning, but they do have a small store and a very relaxing lounge area with couches. I priceline'd this hotel so I got a great deal. I would love to stay at this hotel once again.
