After having seen a Frontera Grill at O'Hare, I had very low expectations for this place. However, midway through the meal (funny - get the double airport mention? I'm a geek, I know), I thought to myself, "wow - what a gem." Food - let's just say, the bonuses started with homemade tortillas and went from there. Innovative, tasty, with flavors that are well matched. Scene - it was early happy hour, but still interesting. Good music, too. Salsa - very fun. Location - at the south end of clark, this is a great spot for anybody down this direction. There are others, but this is a fav. Staff - helpful. quick. do their job so well you don't really notice them. Nice. Overall, good place. Very solid food. Good vibe. I give it a four.
