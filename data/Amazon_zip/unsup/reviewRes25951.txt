This was truly one of the most exciting meals I"ve had in many years. Four of us made a Saturday night reservation and were seated right on time. Beautiful space, wonderful drinks.  The menu is a little daunting upon first look, so we decided that each of us would order 3 items and then we'd go from there. We tried to order something from every type--cold, hot, veggy, meat, smoked or cured, fresh. We got a wonderful mix of things and they were served in exactly the right order (nothing that we stated, they just knew how we should experience the meal).  I love to cook and I know ingredients. What I loved about this restaurant is that the dishes were quite complex and many times we were just flummoxed as to what ingredients were used. Complex does not have to mean elaborate or overdone. Nothing was. It just means that the mixtures of components complemented each other so well, that the flavor marriages were amazingly successful. The smoked meats and cheese, the risotto, the lamb, the crab--seriously everything was great. And waiting and wondering what the next dish would be made for a lot of excitement. Each dish is enough for four to taste. We were afraid we'd be hungry at the end of the meal, but we really weren't. We ordered the large portion of lamb for the four of us and it was generous. If you want a beautiful place, with delicious food and drinks, with a lot of circus and food entertainment for the evening, you cannot go wrong. But bring your wallet. It was a splurge place for us.
