Hot Doug's is hands down, the BEST hot dog that money can buy! There's something about that neon green relish, pickle spear, mustard, and poppy seed bun, that make this perfectly cooked dog, well, perfect! Even my sister who doesn't like red meat (or dogs of any kind,) really enjoyed her dog! If you've never tried one, then you need to get an original Hot Doug hot dog, but if you're feeling adventurous, Hot Doug's is also known for having a revolving inventory of unique meets in tube form, such as the Cherry Pork sausage, Wild Boar, Foi Gras, Cricket, Elk, Blue Cheese, etc. Their fries are pretty bomb, as well. Just don't ask for Ketchup, it's frowned upon in this establishment! You should expect to wait in line, as this is a very popular joint, as well as a very small one as well. The line does move fairly quickly however, and you will be greeted by Doug himself at the cash register. *note - this establishment is CASH ONLY.* Doug is awesome. Even with the large volume of customers that he sees in a day, he remembered me when I came back again later in the day. Whenever I'm in Chicago, I HAVE to make my way to Doug's!
