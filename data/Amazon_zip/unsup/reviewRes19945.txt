Coast has good sushi, but honestly, it's all about the ambiance for me. Unless it's BAD sushi, all sushi sort of tastes the same to me. I really like sushi, but I guess I am just equal opportunity & not one to rave about individual places. I like that it's BYOB, though. Really cuts down on price...however, if I am not mistaken, they charge the corkage fee per person, not bottle. That kind of annoyed me.  So if (almost) all sushi is good sushi & it's all about the ambiance, why not Japonais? Coast is closer to my house.
