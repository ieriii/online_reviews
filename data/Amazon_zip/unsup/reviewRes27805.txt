Very urban, upscale and delicious dining experience. I took my parents and mother-in-law this past Saturday and we all had a wonderful experience. Our server was wonderful and attentive and knew so much about the menu and bar! It never felt too crowded inside or too loud. The decor was really modern but not over the top. The entrees were delicious but a little too small because I think my husband was hungry later that night. I only give it four stars because I thought it was a touch overprice for the amount of food you got. The quality of everything TOP notch though. Definitely would go back for another special occasion.
