A go-to for good, reasonably priced sushi. The menu is about what you'd expect, though pretty well executed. Space is cool, and the addition of the adjoining bar makes the inevitable wait more bearable. My main complaint is that some of the rolls are a little heavy on the mayo. Overall, one of my favorite sushi spots in Lakeview.
