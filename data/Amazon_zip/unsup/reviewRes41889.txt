The family was here for our first prix fixe dinner of Restaurant Week. It was a great meal and the rating is based mainly on the special $32 pricing for 3 courses (starter, main course with a side, and a dessert), and Ruth Chris' excellent service culture. It was very busy at 6:15pm on a Restaurant Week Sunday night, be we had just a 5 minute wait before being lead to a nice, quiet, wood paneled, some what darkish upstairs dining room.  Not sure we would have enjoyed as much being by the bustling bar area downstairs, but it would have been ok for people watching if that turned out to be our spot. Valet parking for $12 was also very convenient. We had one 12 oz ribeye and three 8 oz filets. Bowls of seafood gumbo soup were large and good, and not too salty like at most other places. The aging and the buttery flavor on my ribeye was distinctive and delicious. All was excellent, except that the son's filet was just a little more medium than the requested medium rare, and this honest response was provided really only when he was asked. The waitress, and subsequently the manager jumped on this comment and promptly offered another filet, and when Chris politely turned this down, they insisted on a couple of free desserts (bread pudding and pecan pie, both excellent), along with the prix fixe dessert - chocolate mousse with custard and berries. This is the kind of service you like to see, and their top-notch reputation is well deserved.
