I was here a couple of weekends ago for breakfast. On a Sunday morning around 11 am, this place was not as busy as I expected. There were twice as many lunch options on the menu as there were breakfast choices, so it took us a few minutes to decide. I overheard the cashier (there are no servers here) tell the person in front of me that the heuvos rancheros were to die for. I have a mission to find the best heuvos ever. I've found one version, at a place called Honey's Sit n' Eat in Philly. Naturally, since I've yet to find heuvos nirvana in my hometown, I jumped on it. I should also say that I'm not a fan of order first, then be seated mindset. I feel that's a fast food truc, something that's not worthy of a restaurant. Also, if there's no server waiting on you, how will they know if you liked your meal? That was exactly the problem. My heuvos ranchers were ok, but boring for sure. If I had have used the chipotle mayo/salsa served on the side, it would not have been worth the 6 or so bucks. Definitely not to die for, or even to get a paper cut for. But they didn't know that, since there is no one to ask "how is everything?". My boyfriend's goat cheese portobella sandwich was very tasty, and I deemed Milk & Honey to be a perfect fit for a quick lunch and a cup of coffee, but not somewhere I would go for breakfast again.
