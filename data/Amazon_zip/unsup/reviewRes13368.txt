Came here for their brunch, and it was one of the best brunches that I ever had. We started with the famous bacon fat popcorn, and that of course was good, you just can't go wrong with anything with bacon in it. True story (nod). I had the Pork Belly Sandwich, which was also good, and it also had strips of bacon. Lastly, although they didn't put any bacons in their Cherry Bellini, but it was still awesome. Reminded me the New Glarus Cherry Belgian beer. Yummmm.
