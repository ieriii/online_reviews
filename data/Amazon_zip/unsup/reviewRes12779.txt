Damn that green button!! Normally, a fleet of men offering me meat is a total turn on. However, a girl can only consume so much! Only go here if you are hungry. Not "oh I can eat" hungry, but "I could eat my arm off" hungry! I plan on coming here when Im pregnant, that way Ill totally et my money's worth. The "salad bar" is one straight out of Vegas!  I loved the service, the food, and the general atmosphere. I will be back!
