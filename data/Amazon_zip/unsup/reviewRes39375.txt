This was my week for trying out gastropubs, finally!!! Came here on Tuesday night on a date. I got there pretty early so I started things off right with a shot of Buffalo Trace whiskey (diluted with water, of course). Spent some time talking to the bartender, Derrick, who was very nice and charming. I followed up my whiskey with a Belgian Tripel on tap. Again, very light and refreshing. When my date finally arrived, I was sufficiently tipsy and luckily, the host staff found a table for us pretty quickly. Everyone who works there is just as friendly as can be. They're not pretentious or uppity. It's soooo refreshing and made the experience that much better. My date and I started off by splitting a glass of cava, in celebration of my new job! We also each ordered a bottle of the Bell's Cherry Stout, which ended up complimenting our dinner very well. We started off with the meatball small plate: goat meatballs served over polenta with a red sauce and pesto. It was surprisingly light and the polenta, which I usually shy away from because of texture, was really creamy and full of flavor. I devoured that dish, no problem. For the entree, we decided to share the daily special, which turned out to be beef tenderloin served over polenta with mushrooms (possibly chanterelle?) and ramps. The beef was cooked to perfection. It was pink in the middle and nicely browned on the outside. The meat was tender, full of flavor, and the earthy mushrooms and ramps were sinfully good. Basically, L&E could become my new favorite bar in Chicago. I have a feeling that all of the other dishes are just as wonderful, if not better, than the amazing food we had on Tuesday. Oh I almost forgot to mention that they served an amuse bouche as we sat down. It consisted of foie gras (AHHHH so yummy!) with small piece a candied/poached pear. Everything was perfection. I can't wait to go back.
