We really enjoyed our evening at Sunda - It has a fun ambiance and great cocktails (cucumber saketini was excellent). Definitely a lively place for a small group dinner. We took friends from out-of-town and they loved it. Just keep in mind that the restaurant is really loud so don't go here if you are looking for a quiet evening. Food is great. We started with the steamed bao buns with pork belly - super tasty. We also tried the lemongrass beef lollipops, which were good (but not as flavorful as the bao buns). As for sushi, I liked the simplicity of the Wa-Machi maki. It wasn't as wasabi hot as I expected, but it still was a tasty, simple roll. The Number Ten roll was a total crowd pleaser - a bit saucy and complicated, but the flavors worked well together and everyone enjoyed it. Those two were the most memorable rolls, but we enjoyed everything we ordered. Although food and cocktail prices are on the high side, I liked that they have reasonable options for bottles of wine. We ordered bottles of Sauvingon Blanc and Rose that were each in the $35-$45 range. They have the always delicious mochi ice-cream for dessert - love it. The dish has a bunch of interesting flavors and is large enough to share with the entire table. Yum!
