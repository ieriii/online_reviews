The best tapas I've ever had. It was the 3rd tapas place I've eaten at in 3 weeks and clearly the reigning champion of all tapas. The bright deep complex of all the dishes really stood out. Bold great pleasing flavors. Favorite dishes of the night - chocolate bon bon dessert was amazing. maybe the best bite I've had all year - scallop on the planks, succulent, perfectly cooked and tasty as hell - pork belly was so tiny but amazing. lacquered and crispy skin. Delicious - bacon wrapped dates kick AOC's ass to the curb - croquettes melted in your mouth, either the best or 2nd best along with the Bazaar - garlic shrimp was garlicky goodness, they didn't skimp on the garlic They have a beer here than Ferrian Adria from el Bulli made a limited addition of. It was a big 750ml bottle. You should order it. It has an unbelievable bouquet for a beer and the flavor profile was something that you wouldn't expect for a beer. Wonderful accompanying beverage to our meal. A really nice surprise. Every dish we had with the exception of a tuna dish was memorable. Big, bold Spanish flair. The best restaurant I've been to in Chicago. Probably doesn't mean all that much since I haven't been to Alinea or Girl & the Goat. Highly recommend.
