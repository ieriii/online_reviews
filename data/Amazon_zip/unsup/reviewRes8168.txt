We started with an appetizer special of potatoes/pepper, and although it tasted fresh it was underseasoned and uninteresting. We didn't even finish it. Ordered three pizzas, margherita, a daily special (rapini, sausage), and another special (pecorino, proscuitto). What surprised me was how soggy the crust was. The edge was crispy upon arrival but it progressively got soggier minute by minute. All were tasty but not notable. The best was the margherita because of the very tasty tomato sauce. VERY little basil though, disappointing. Bill was $100 for three ind pizzas, one app, one beer, two glasses of wine. Way overpriced, especially when they're dealing with such a volume of people. Oh well.
