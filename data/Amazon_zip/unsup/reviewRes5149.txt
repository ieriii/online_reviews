Great place- love the ambiance and the decor. I would describe the food as return to the old classics, but re-defined with more than a touch of sophistication. Milk brazed shoulder was so yummy and went down really well with a white wine (cannot remember which one now) that I picked from the extensive wine list. Yum yum- can't wait to find a reason to go there again The only bad thing? the fact that parking can be expensive.
