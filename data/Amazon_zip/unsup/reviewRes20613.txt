The quality of the sushi was good the price just didn't match up to Toro Sushi - my favorite on Clark Street. The rolls were at least $2 more a piece - which is fine if there is something that makes them worth the extra $2. The service was good and the setting was nice, it was dark but not too dark. I enjoyed the food but have a closer, less expensive place nearby.
