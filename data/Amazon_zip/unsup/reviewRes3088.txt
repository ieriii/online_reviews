My brother took us here and did the ordering, so I'm not 100% sure what we got, but all of the wings were SO YUMMY. We had some plain ones, and some I think Seoul Sassy. I could've stayed there eating those all day long. The wings are where it's at. We also got onion rings and mushrooms, which were good. I usually don't eat mushrooms, but happily popped a few of those. There were rolls of paper towels on the tables, but I would've liked something a bit more absorbent. And, it would've been nice if they gave out some of those wet towelette things, so we could clean up a bit at the end of the meal and not have to walk back to the restroom, like I did, holding my hands up like I was surrendering to something (the food?)
