Me: "Ooo, I can't wait for the lamb!" ... "Hello sir, some lamb?" Or, well, that's how I would imagine he would have asked me if they ever brought the lamb around. But, I understand that. I mean, we were only there for a short period of time, so we only saw beef and chicken.. Yep, a short 90 minute period of time.
