Where do I start. First of all the food was delicious. We got the collection tasting menu and it included the 10 items listed along with a few other starters.  The weird thing was that no one else was there. It was a friday night and granted it was snowing pretty hard but the notion that everyone else cancelled their reservations seems unlikely. So a Michelin 1 star restaurant is empty on a friday night. It's weird. We still had a great time. Good food, music, and service. The atmosphere was just lacking.
