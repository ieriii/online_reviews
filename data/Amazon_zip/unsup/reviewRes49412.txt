Let's be clear; throw a rock from anyplace in the city, and you're sure to hit a steakhouse. There's not a lot of ways to differentiate all of them from each other. After dining at Las Tablas this past Saturday, this place was somehow special. The restaurant's specialty dish is the Entrana: a juicy cut of skirt steak served with sweet plantain, fried yuca and Colombian style potato. I saw it being made via a clip on their website and decided to give it a try. It didn't disappoint. My sisters dined on the churrasquito (NY strip steak with the same sides as mine) and the Bandeja Paisa (rib-eye steak served with fried pork belly, rice, beans, fried egg, sweet plantain and avocado). I think I found my next dish to try for my next visit!. Waiting for our order, you also can't help noticing the artwork along the walls in the restaurant. There were various portraits of people in different corners-I didn't know who they were, but they were interesting to look at. Another interesting tidbit: on the back of the menu, you can read of the story of how the restaurant was built: how the owners struggled making a living when they first set foot in the city, the fire that destroyed their first restaurant, and how they rebuilt in the restaurant's current location. The chairs and tables were handmade in Columbia and brought into the restaurant. The three of us declared our waiter as a guy who truly loved his job. He took time to tell us about the menu; served our food with a minimal wait time, and checked in with us throughout the night. He noted that the rub that is used in the Entrana dish is made with ingredients that only the owner and the son know. Interesting. A truly enjoyable experience; there's no doubt that this is once place I would go back to.
