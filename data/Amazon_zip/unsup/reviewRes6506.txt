I've been hearing about this place for months and decided to go ahead and have dinner here at 8pm on a Wednesday night. Upon arrival we were told to wait 30 minutes for a party of 2. Half an hour on a late Wednesday night?? I'm glad I waited. Time flew by as we killed time at the Starbucks just down the street and before we knew it, I was looking at the extensive, almost overwhelming menu and drink list. Since I had to be at work at 6am, we opted to stick with the unique looking pitcher of water on the table and focused on the solids. First up was the pork belly. I don't know how soft and juicy pork belly usually is, but this was a hot-off-the-oven-melt-in-your-mouth nrvana-inducing experience! I wish it had come last because it was the best thing I had that night. Next came the truffle egg toast, which we felt obliged to try from the previous reviews. Also a W, although I was expecting a richer taste and the yolk seemed to win against the truffle oil. We ended with the sea urchin linguine and grilled half chicken. The linguine was very good, a strong texture to the pasta and fresh taste from the seafood. From what I could taste, it was tossed with a light oil, which was great b/c a thick sauce would not have meshed with everything else I was having. The chicken was well-cooked, but forgettable compared to the other dishes. Decided to opt for the yogurt dessert, which brought the meal to a nice, light but tasty evening. Overall a great experience, really recommend for a nice dinner for two or small group of friends. Wouldn't really recommened for a 1st date or important convo, as the ambiance was dark and the small size of the restaurant made everyone's conversation carry. But the food, come for the food. Even if it is always a 30 minute wait.
