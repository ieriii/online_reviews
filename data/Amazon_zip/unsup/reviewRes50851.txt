Oh god where to begin with Wishbone? I've been here so many times I can't even keep count anymore. I always try something new every time I go. The cornbread is a must, period. The watermelon lemonade is amazing, and to be honest just writing this review makes me want to stop in and pick some up! The decor is pretty sweet, very flashy and colorful. Delicious food...flashy decor....win/win. I love this place, please lord jesus never change.
