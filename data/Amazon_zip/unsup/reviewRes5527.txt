Had a really nice date here. Great for lunch (haven't tried dinner yet). We sat outside on the little patio, which was pretty good for people watching. Good for small plates and sharing. Great wine list. Loved the bone marrow, also loved the crispy pigs ear with kale. The fried deviled egg was just so wrong it was right, if you know what I mean. So bad for me, but I wanted more. And they have lardo. Something you don't find just anywhere, and so freakin' good. There are some great vegetarian options (but vegans should steer clear)- fava bean/ricotta spread, paninis, etc. Service was also good, but the popularity of this place can mean a longer wait.
