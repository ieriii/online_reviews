My friend and I ventured in for dinner this past Friday, and we were both totally impressed. We arrived at around seven, and were seated immediately. We brought our own wine, and they opened it immediately and chilled the bottle of white we brought with us in a fridge in the back. We ordered calamari for an appetizer, and it was delicious. They also dropped off a ton of chewy bread with olive oil and garlic. We each ordered our own entree, and when the food came, we realized we could have easily split one. The portions are HUGE. He did the chicken parm, I did gnocchi stuffed with pesto and asiago. It was phenomenal. We did the tiramisu for dessert, and that too was awesome. The staff was extremely attentive and quick with everything. We were both stuffed and satisfied by the time we left, and shocked at how reasonable our bill was. I'll be back. Great experience. Oh, and by the time we walked out, around 9, the place was packed... just an fyi.
