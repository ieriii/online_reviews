Had dinner here on Friday night to celebrate the aging of JN. The place was obscenely busy. Like, the waiting area was swarming with groups of people and I had to run away to catch my breath while waiting for our table. So, make reservations and definitely go elsewhere if you want a quiet dinner. This place is enormous, colorful and seemed filled with large birthday groups. Anyway, our server was great and the food was pretty good (and they make one tasty mojito). To start, we split the arepa, ropa vieja, and the salad special. The arepa was a big hit with J but I felt the pork was a little fatty. The rope vieja was all sorts of awesome though. Braised beef and plaintains? Yes yes yes! My favorite of the evening was the special salad - local greens (it was this thick purple spinach that I've never seen before and have been obsessing over ever since), marcona almonds, local cheddar, onions, Michigan apple and a chili serrano vinaigrette. Swoon! We should have stopped there but also had the pernil and arrachera (Maria's fault!). The pork shoulder was very sweet. The arrachera was beefy goodness and honestly, you can put chimichurri over anything and I will swallow it whole. Dessert was a little disappointing. We ordered the churros and they were really crunchy, like, a good baguette almost gum-cutting crunchy. Luckily, our server brought J out a little birthday treat - a sticky toffee cake topped with pineapple sticks. Quite tasty. So why only 3 stars? This type of restaurant just really isn't my scene. When I want ethnic food of any kind (Mexican, Vietnamese, Japanese, Cuban, etc etc) I am much happier when I eat in a small, no frills, family run place - they are my happy place. Swanky lighting and bright wallpaper always seems to detract from my experience. Of course, if J wanted to come back for a special occasion, I would too and eat a bunch of beef and pray that they have those purple spinach leaves again.
