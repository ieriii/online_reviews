How have I never reviewed this place? The 700+ reviews speak for themselves and I don't have anything original to add. This pizza is GOOD. The "caremelized" cheese (read: burned) around the edge of the crust gives their deep dish pizza a unique flavor. I like the kind of chaotic bar atmosphere as well. Great place!
