A little torn in this review. I like the place if you're going to make a whole night of it. But it you're just looking to eat and go....then you have some better options. The venue and service is great, but the food was just ok....compared to fogo and brizzaz, it falls short in the food category. Would give the food 3 stars, but the great style and service bumps them up to 4stars. I would definitely come here to hang out as the bar and rooftop area are great for socializing before and/or after a meal. The decor is ultra chic and contemporary. Warm wood tones and black with luxurious finishes from the silverware and dinnerware to the light fixtures bathrooms.  The food is pretty good, and you do get a lot of it. But I just didn't feel like there was as much beef variety as their competitors. The did have fish, chicken, and sausages that were also good. But I would have preferred a mound of steak on my plate. Their salad and sides bar was nice too, but I try to avoid that area if I'm at a brazilian steakhouse....bread and salads are just fillers in this case. It's not a bad concept since there really isn't a trendy, chic brazilian steak place. I like the place and will come back, but would recommend that they "BEEF" up their menu....literally.
