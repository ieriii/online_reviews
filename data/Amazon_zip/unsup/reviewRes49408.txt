I've come here for my birthday for the last few years. The matrimonio platter with chicken and skirt steak is amazing. Their meats and seafood are never dry, full of flavor and served in large portions. Get the patacon pisao. It's one of their best appetizers if you ask me. Their flan is unbelievable. They're BYOB (wine only) weekdays except Friday through Sunday. I wish they did beer but... I understand what they're trying to do. While people are eating at Gibson's or some other overrated steakhouse, I bring my friends and family for a guaranteed awesome food and time.
