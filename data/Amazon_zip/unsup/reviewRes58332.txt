I have never had a bad anything at Shaw's! Not a bread stick, an ice cube or a dirty look This place rocks! The Lobster Bisque is on my list of things to have at my last meal. The oysters are so fresh I get visions of the ocean and can feel the mist. I will be there two Sundays from now for the Hotel Brunch to celebrate my Birthday! I CAN NOT WAIT! The dining room is calm, serene and elegant, BUT the bar is loud and fun. I once entered the oyster eating contest. I did not come close to winning but how can you lose with all the oysters you can eat and a Shaw's Crab House tee shirt. I'll never do that again but I treasure the memory/
