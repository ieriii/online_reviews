Las Tablas, you are delicious. Went there on a Wed. night and there was no crowd, therefore immediately seated. Soft lighting, and the decor (Fernando Botero - fat people and animals reign) and furniture is beauitful (the brothers of the owners made all of the tables, chairs, woodwork in both restaurants!). We had the empanada sampler (chicken, cheese, and beef) - terrific. Even though I would consider empandas a simple dish, these were really frickin' good. The sangria was good and I had a Refajo (soda and beer combo) which was suprisingly tasty and easy to drink with dinner. One thing to note is that the BYOB option is only Monday - Thursday for the Lincoln Park/Lakeview location only. It's wine only, no beer or liquor. Come hungry as the portions are ginormous. Two chicks can easily split a combo platter. If you're a dude that likes to mow down, this is the place for you. Very nice experience. Would go again. Also, if you're driving and it's relatively early (before 9pm weekdays), you'll be surprised with metered street parking availability.
