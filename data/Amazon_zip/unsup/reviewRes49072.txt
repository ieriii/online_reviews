Went to Publican on a Mon night with two girlfriends. We were seated promptly at 7 pm- the place was not very full but filled up as the meal progressed. I liked our private little "stall" of a booth- I don't love the communal tables so was glad we had our own spot.. We had a delicious Malbec to start- priced at $37- not bad at all! We started off with the tuna crudo which was delicious. Then we had the beets with burrata- YUM the burrata was so creamy and springy tasting, the beets perfectly roasted and seasoned. As my friend said, it was almost like dessert. Then we had the soft shelled crab appetizer with Marcona almonds- they were the "first of the season" from Maryland according to our fantastic server Chris. Then we did the chicken with sausage and french fries. I'm not one to typically order chicken- but this was really really good. It was super seasoned, the chicken was really juicy and the fries were so yummy in the drippings- so bad yet so good. The ribs were the least impressive dish of the night- they were more like pork chops and a little dry, but the other dishes were great and I was plenty full so forgive them. We skipped dessert this time. around but will be back again.
