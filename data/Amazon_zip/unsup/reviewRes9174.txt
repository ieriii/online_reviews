Noon is delicious. Period. Take your friends. Take your family. Get some meat and rice as well as a lovely complementary plate of feta, greens and bread.The staff is friendly, the dining room is pretty and it's right off the train. You'll be glad you came as the prices are very reasonable for a great dinner out on the town. Thanks for being so tasty, Noon. Cheers to you with Persian Tea!
