I love me some Italian food so going to Piccolo Sogno last Sunday night was a major plus for me. I normally go to my old standby of Francesca's on Taylor St so I was intrigued by what others had told me about PS. We came for a birthday party and I was impressed by the warm decor and intimate setup. Ordered some calamari which was hot (important for me!) and very good, my wife ordered the braised short ribs on polenta very tender and yummy. I ordered the special pasta with Parmesan and mushroom which was light on taste but good nevertheless. Overall I was impressed about Piccolo Sogno and would go again. Va Bene!
