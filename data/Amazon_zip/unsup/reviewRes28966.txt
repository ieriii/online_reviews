i was beginning to think that perhaps i just don't like deep dish pizza, but after a friend raved about this place, i had to give it a try, especially since it's within walking distance of home. they load their pizzas with toppings, which is a plus in my book. i had a pizza with mushrooms, black olives & large chunks of sausage and found it quite tasty. i don't usually like burnt food, and the cheese on the crust does look burnt, but it was the most flavorful part of the pizza. the tomato sauce could use more seasoning, but overall better than uno or giordano's. i can't say i fully recommend the fried shrooms. they were standard fare, and though they weren't greasy, the mushrooms inside seemed a bit too juicy and bland. the service was friendly and fast though i think the place gets more crowded on the weekend. i'll be back or order delivery when i need a pizza fix.
