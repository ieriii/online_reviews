The search is over. What else do you want me to say? The best REAL true Italian Pizza in Chicago is right here at Spacca Napoli. I am married to a pizza hater. Who hates pizza? Freak. Anyway, I have wanted to go to Spacca Napoli for weeks, I did not want to go there with the pizza hater, I wanted to go with people who would really appreciate this pizza I had heard all about that is baked in the oven that was made and shipped from Italy. So, I went with my mom, dad, brother and SIL. We were in heaven. A couple of things- We did not have to wait we went for an early dinner 530pm and walked right in, sat right down. Service was friendly, let them help you, let them make suggestions. We did, and we were quite pleased with our waiters recommendations. Order one pizza per person at the table, and eat family style. There will be very little left over if any. TRUST ME.
