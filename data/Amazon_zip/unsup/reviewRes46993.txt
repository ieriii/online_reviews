Absolutely yummy. For starters, I recommend the seasonal flat-bread and the sweet potato fries. I had a beautifully presented seared trout served with sauteed spinach and fava beans. It may seem on the mundane side, but I have a great appreciation for a well cooked vegetable. The spinach was perfectly prepared and it was just as tasty as the trout. The waitstaff was pleasant, attentive, and kept the sangria coming. With regards to your immediate surroundings, you'll find that it is pleasantly lit and cozy. On the night that I went their was a live band, who was great but their sound person liked to tune things on the loud side which can be a bit much when you're sitting close to a speaker (like I was).
