I couldn't remember the name of this place, so I entered "meat" into the search bar, selected Chicago, IL, and hit enter. Fogo de Chao was the first result. And not only is that funny, fitting, and true, it is also quite tasty. I made myself sick here once. No joke. Puked my guts out at 3AM. My husband must have radioactive stomach acid, however, because he was fine after consuming approximately 10x what I ate. Go for lunch for a good bargain. Be careful if you're the sort who goes overboard on buffets "because I paid one price and therefore the more I eat the better the bargain."
