Boo. I live in this neighborhood. When I heard Revolution was opening, I hoped it would be a cool, DIY variant of the Streetside Cafe. A kind of friendly, local brewpub that would be casual, and, sure, offer nice food and more of a sit-down atmostphere, but still be a spot where locals would congregate and community-feeling could be built.  Instead, Revolution Brewing is a fancy restaurant for people from other neighborhoods who want to come to Logan and feel as though they are going to a "Bohemian" brewpub. In addition to this bait-and-switch, other things about Revolution suck. The interior is too well-lit, and utterly antiseptic. The food's good, but very slow to come, and more than a little overpriced. The servers are too formal and businesslike. Though there's a physical bar in the center, it has the feeling of the bar in an Applebee's-- not an authentic bar where folks would hang out.  During my visit, I tried a sampler of all of the beers. Though some were certainly tasty (and others less-so), the atmosphere of this place left a bad taste in my mouth that had nothing to do with barley and hops.
