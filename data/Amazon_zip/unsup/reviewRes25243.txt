For a non-authentic Greek restaurant in the midst of a neighborhood containing traditional powerhouses like Roditys and Santorini, I think this place does pretty well for itself. The atmosphere is open, inviting, and delightfully sumptuous over by the dessert counter. For the restaurant part, you can choose either a lower level by plenty of windows near the bar, or a more cramped upper level where I could only imagine the pain of a waitress' feet after running up and down those stairs all night! The food is above average, and there are some questionably gimmicky things about the menu, i.e. no soda refills (pay by the mini-bottle) and only one size of soup, which is an unmistakeably large bowl (not suitable if you have a large entree to follow). Overall very good.
