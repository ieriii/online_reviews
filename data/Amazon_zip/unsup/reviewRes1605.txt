After reading several reviews of Hot Doug's i decided on a recent trip to Chicago to visit a friend that i had to check it out, no matter what the cost or how long i had to wait. We got there around 1pm on a saturday and had to wait about 45 minutes but boy was it worth it. I got the foie gras hot dog with truffle butter and foie gras mousse, and a jalapeno chardonnay rattlesnake dog with smoked gouda and chipotle mayo. Both were out of this world, leave you drooling and staring off into space good. The GF ordered a traditional brat and our friend got a polish sausage. I had bites of both, and while they were certainly more traditional dogs, both were perfectly executed. We also got an order of regular fries and an order of duck fries (served on friday and saturday ONLY) for the sake of comparison. The duck fries are cut thinner, a little crispier, and have a bit of a more complex flavor, but both options are ridiculously tasty. This place is truly and gem and makes me jealous of all you folks that get to live in Chicago (until the winter, when you guys get to envy all of us in the Bay Area). This might just have to be one of those places i hit every time i return to Chicago. Its THAT good.
