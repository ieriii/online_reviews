I have been a fan of the Hot Dog for quite some time now. I stop in little loints all the time looking for the perfect dog. Many have come close, but I seem to have finally found what I have been looking for. Simply put, Hot Doug's has the best Chicago Style red hots in the city -- period. I have been there six times now and the place never disappoints. Poppyseed buns, a wide array of topping options (including kraut!), and you can get your dogs charred, steamed, or fried. And be warned, a large order of fries is more than enough for two people to share. If you go there during prime lunch hour, be prepared to wait in a line that might stretch out the door and up the block. Don't worry, it's worth the wait! Better yet, go in after 2pm and the line will be much easier to manage. Doug also has some other great sausages as well, including some fantastic daily specials that you won't find anywhere else. (Rabbit or Wild Boar sausage anyone?) On top of the great food, the way the place is decorated is a hoot. Doug has a sense of humor and it shows. I love this place and I think every hot dog lover should try it. Just remember, it's all about hot dogs and other sausages, so don't go there expecting a beef stand menu with burgers, beef sandwiches, and salads. It's all about the encased meats here. I think Doug makes a vegetarian friendly sausage, but it's a pretty much all meat menu. Thanks for the best hot dogs in Chicago, my friend!
