I came here with a group of 13 people for my birthday dinner. Dinner and fun! I would totally give them 5 stars, however, they didn't have my reservation which screwed things up a tad. They gave us an almost big enough table for our group but of course everyone wasn't on time (even I wasn't) and the hostess gave us a little (in good fun) crap--asking who made the reservation and if we could count. I tried to hold my oh-so-common smart ass remarks in, but failed. I don't feel bad though, she deserved it. Anyway, I have heard not to expect much when it comes to good service here, but this night it was just fine. Especially for a rather large group. We had a couple orders of chicken, beef, pork and ribs...all were seasoned nicely. A friend of mine ordered the beef and asparagus roll as an appetizer and while I'm not a huge asparagus fan, I tried it and would gladly order that again.  If you haven't done Korean bbq before, you should. This place is good for groups or even for a date. Don't get too cranky if the service isn't spot on. Be patient and enjoy yourself. Oh, and don't pour your own drink, let a friend do it---it's considered rude in the Korean culture.
