Service was pretty quick and attentive. Checking out other people's plates before we decided to stay and eat, the food looked pretty good. Sesame chicken I ordered was a little disappointing. The menu indicated it was sweet, but that was not the product I received (or was used to). It wasn't that bad though, just not what I'd been craving per se. Nevertheless, my faux acid reflux got the best of me, so I maxed that chicken to kingdom come. My friend got the spring rolls and crispy sweet potatoes, which she seemed to enjoy enough to finish. Overall, it served a purpose, but definitely didn't hit the spot. It's possible I ordered the wrong things, however.
