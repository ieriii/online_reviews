If you like the worlds best beers and fresh oysters your gonna love the Publican, I quaffed several exotic brews, Surly furious being one as we waited to be seated. We started with a dozen very fresh oysters while sipping on a belguim white beer, Our entrees where the Potee and the Chareuterie Plate, Both very tasty and filling, I wouldn't take a first date there as it is communal seating and quite loud, but in a good way, everyone was having fun!!! I cant wait to go back.
