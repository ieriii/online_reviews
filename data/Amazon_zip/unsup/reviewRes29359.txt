This is a great Thai restaurant. It does get busy on the weekends, but thankfully they have an extra room to sit you. It's funny how there are about a dozen other Thai places on Western fairly close to this one and they are pretty empty. That should tell you something. The food is great and my girlfriend just came back from spending 2 months in Thailand and this was a good authenticity test for her. It passed with flying colors! She loved it as well. Looking forward to going back soon!
