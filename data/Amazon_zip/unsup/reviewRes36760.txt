oh. my. geez.  FIVE extremely enthusiastic stars!!! WOW. A menu w/ a foreword/mission statement? Impressive! There's even a little excerpt about the eggs the restaurant uses. Call me crazy, but I love attention to detail like this! From the spotless corners, decor and fresh flowers, to the friendly hostesses and servers....this place is AMAZING. The food confirms it is a MUST-TRY breakfast spot.  Sooo many different omelettes. My boyfriend always gets the Emerald Aisle. The baby reds (Meli's offering of breakfast carbs/hash browns) are perfectly seasoned and cooked. The honey butter (Meli means honey in greek) is placed on the table w/ that day's selection of 2 fresh jams.  The whole menu varies from american to mediterranean, each item being made w/ great detail to each and every ingredient. Check out the menu and you'll see exactly what I mean. Everything sounds sooo good! I haven't strayed away from ordering outside of breakfast, but one day I will venture out and order some lunch. It's true what the other yelpers say, get to Meli early if you don't want to endure a hellacious wait for a heavenly breakfast/brunch/lunch.
