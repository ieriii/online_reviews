Saw this on check, please a few weeks ago, and finally had the opportunity to stop in and check it out. The decor was exactly as described on the show - you kind of feel like you are in a middle eastern bizarre...which i happen to rather enjoy. Menu had lots of tasty options for crepes, both savory and sweet. You could also build your own, if you so choose. I went with the Crepe de Roma, which had portabella mushrooms, arugula, swiss cheese, capers and roma tomatoes. Very tasty combination! The crepe itself was very flavorful and light, and was very complimentary to the multitude of flavors inside of it.  The crepe came with a bowl of soup, and I opted for the vegetable one. Great choice - the soup was piping hot and so flavorful! They also give you some red sauce on the side to add some kick if you like, which I like.  All in all, check, please rarely steers me wrong, and this was no exception. I will be back to try one of their sweet crepes!
