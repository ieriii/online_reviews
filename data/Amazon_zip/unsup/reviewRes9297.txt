The food here is fan-freaking-tastic. The service is very nice, if sometimes stuffy (not always - somtimes it's very midwestern - but I have experienced some stuffiness). The whole celebration of colonialism thing is a little weird, even though it is very aesthetically pleasing.  I found a tofu dish that I have literally been searching for over the past 12 years, so that was cool. Now I know where to go when I get that particular craving, or the craving for shrimp skewered on sugar cane with an unbelievably delicious sauce.
