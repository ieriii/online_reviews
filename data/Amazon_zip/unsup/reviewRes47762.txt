Unlimited Brunch Heaven... The restaurant has a slightly organic, outdoorsy feel with heavy wood accents, dark. The space is clean and rustic with modern and unique fireplaces through out the restaurant.  Our waitress was helpful and attentive, clearly explaining the process at ZED451. She did an excellent job of recommending and pointing out their best dishes. The set-up of ZED451 is like that of a Brazilian steakhouse, where it is pretty much unlimited/"all-you-can-eat." I went for the Brunch, which is quite a deal for 29.00- you have choices of premium meats and "Harvest Table" offerings.  You start with the Harvest Table with a large selection of fresh fruits, desserts (YOU HAVE TO TRY THEIR RASPBERRY CHOCOLATE TART), warm french toast (plain french toast), salads, cold plate (sesame noodles, spicy green beans, octopus salad), gourmet cheeses, a moist duck confit hash brown. The fare available on the table is completely delicious, BUT MAKE SURE YOU SAVE ROOM FOR THE BEST STUFF!! After hitting the Harvest Table, you put the rock out on the table and the chefs start coming around with a few small plates: corned beef hash with poached egg, egg fritata, cinnamon buns, AND THE AMAZING CAJUN BACON. The corned beef hash is good with a nice, brown crunchy outer layer with a nice warm gooey egg. The fritata was a little too heavy on the cheese and egg factor, I definitely taste the eggs. The cinnamon buns were of the same quality of with that of Cinnabon's!! The melted cream cheese topping completes the soft inners of the bun with the crunchy outer layers of the cinnamon bun. THE BEST THING BACON I HAVE EVER EATEN WAS THEIR CAJUN BACON THAT COMES IN THIS SMALL IRON SKILLET. It is slightly spicy, slightly sweet, and fully savory, which appeals to pretty much everyone. There are unlimited refills of the bacon with roughly 5-6 slices per order, I MUST HAVE EATEN ROUGHLY 3-4 ORDERS OF IT.. SOOO SOOO AMAZING!!! The chefs then come around with the premium meats and offerings. The first piece was a play on Eggs Benedict with poached eggs on top of a crab cake with a light Hollandaise sauce. The combination was different and unique, but each component by itself was okay. The next thing we got was a miniature buffalo chicken and waffles, which was good with the syrup and the spicy. However, the buffalo sauce overpowered the syrup and the sweetness of the waffle. It would be amazing with a little more syrup. The next part was the Ranch Sirloin Steak. The steak was moist, juicy, and delicious. IT MELTS IN YOUR MOUTH; IT'S PERFECTLY SEASONED. I had the chefs come back 2-3 times for the steak. We also got the roasted turkey and cranberry dressing. In terms of the premium meats and offerings, the ROASTED TURKEY WAS MY FAVORITE WITH THE SWEET DRESSING AND THE SAVORY TASTE OF THE TURKEY. I also had a roasted sausage that was meaty and full of flavor, but I have had similar sausage. I feel like I'm forgetting a meat, there were so many. If I remember, I'll be sure to comment.. I also ordered a Bloody Mary that was slightly too peppery, but had the right amount of kick and spice. It was a part of their drink specials for the day for 5.00. ZED451 gets 5 stars for the excellent customer service, atmosphere, abundant mostly delicious fare, and cajun bacon. I can't wait to go back for their Brunch and next time I'll jst get a mimosa!! :D AHH CAJUN BACONNN (mouth-watering over the laptop keyboard now)!!
