One of my favorite restaurants! I love this place!! The food is great (my fav: pesto linguine with added grilled chicken), the service is friendly and quick, it's not that expensive, the restaurant is lovely to sit in, oh and the food is great :) I've taken everyone who has come to visit me in Chicago here, and if i don't go back at least once every 2 weeks my cravings for their pasta gets too much to handle....
