Positives: Bone Marrow, Pig Ears Negatives: My stomach can't fit more! My girls and I came here after reading the amazing reviews. As the lovely Yelpers suggested, we dutifully ordered the bone marrow and pig ears before our bottoms even sat down. The bone marrow was stupendous. Can you imagine? Hot, roasted bones erupting with rich marrow, served with buttered bread, parsley, and sea salt. It just melted in your mouth. Like butter, only BETTER. Yes, apparently, there IS something better than butter. My mind is still blown. It was so good. In fact, it was so good, we ordered a SECOND serving. Just three little girls and yes, we had MORE marrow. That's how good it is. My personal favorite was also the pig ear. Deep fried strips of pig ear with kale, banana peppers, with creamy egg mixed in, it came in the more darling little pig dish. I know it's just dinnerware, but it was so adorable! The pork jowl was literally fork tender. It tasted so flavorful, and I'm sure it would have been delicious if it hadn't been eclipsed by the glory of the marrow. I loved the carrot and lemon puree which added a lovely tartness to dish. The creamy pork shoulder tasted like flavorful pork roast. It was the last of all the dishes to come out, and, quite honestly, we were full by that time, so it was barely touched. The potatoes were really delectable as well.
