I should've taken a hint when the two fellows in front of me left because no one acknowledged them nor took their order. I was hungry, and a friend who lives around the corner swears by this place.  Maybe my burrito expectations are too lofty, but, methinks a burrito should be more than meat, cilantro and onions wrapped in a burnt tortilla. You read that right -- the tortilla was placed on the grill, for far too long, giving it a certain char I like to call "burnt". Then, the kid behind the counter barely looked at me, and when I ordered a carne asada burrito, he asks, flippantly I might add, "cilantro and onions?" I think to myself, sure, I like cilantro and onions, and I said, "Sure." Little did I know my burrito would be stuffed with ONLY beef, cilantro and onions. No salsa. No Lettuce (which I usually pass on). No tomato. No beans. No rice. It was the equivalent of a massive taco, just wrapped closed. The meat-steak was very tasty, but the 7 1/2 cups of onions kind of overpowered any other flavor I may have experienced. Oh, and I had to ask for salsa -- it was the green kind. And, it was totally flavorless -- nothing like two little cups of boiled, pureed tomatillo "salsa." Mmmm mmmm. (read with extreme sarcasm). I may go back for "drunk tacos", of which other reviewers have mentioned. I will never return sober, nor drunk, for a "meat and onion burrito." No, gracias.
