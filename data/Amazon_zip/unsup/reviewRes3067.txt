Hit up Crisp on a Friday night and surprisingly the wait was not bad at all ... ordered food within a few minutes and had it in hand within 10. Like others have said, the wings are enormous - and delicious. Ended up trying wings, one fried half-chicken, a chicken sandwich, and boneless wings (split between four people). Everything was pretty great, the Seoul Sassy sauce was my favorite. There's also some killer hot sauce on the tables in yellow squirt bottles that I would like to venture to have in my home at some point. Would like to try the fried chicken (either wings or half) without any sauce just to see what they're actually working with before doctoring it up. Decent prices, good food, good selection of accoutrements - will definitely return.
