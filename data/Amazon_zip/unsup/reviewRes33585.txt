Fast, Easy, DELICIOUS...and healthy! Since I tasted my first falafel here I took upon myself to see if I could find a superior falafel sandwich elsewhere. This journey has taken me outside of Chicago city limits to places like San Fransico, New York, and...yes...even the booming metropolis of Austin, TX. I have YET to find a falafel tastier than Sultan's. When I bring guests from out of town to the restaurant for the first time they always ask for a return trip the Sultan's Market before they fly back to their respective cities. If I find myself within a five block radius of this place my bike, car, or feet automatically turn towards the restaurant as if there is some sort of tractor beam pulling us in. My only explanation is that their falafel is laced with additive chemicals...jokes...just jokes...but seriously my friends... I find it VERY hard to stray away from the falafel sandwich but when I do I'm never disappointed. Their salad bar is nothing short of amazing, the shawerma is terrific, and the lentil soup down right delicious. There are also several great items for purchase located on the shelves in front of the kitchen area. I highly recommend the chili sauce because it goes great with everything. These items also make for great reading material while you are waiting in line...but you won't be there long because these folks are QUICK!
