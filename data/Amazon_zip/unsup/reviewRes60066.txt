Big Jones is delicious, inventive, and ber friendly. It's our go-to restaurant for taking visiting friends and family or if my family just feels like grabbing brunch. Our service has always been spectacular and the food is always at once both inspiring and comforting. I'm so happy that we live a few blocks from Big Jones and are only a few minutes away from one of the very best restaurants in Chicago. If you haven't already tried it, I demand you go now! You won't be disappointed!
