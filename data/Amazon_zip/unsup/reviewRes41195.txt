I am such a fan of this place. I feel spoiled to say that I've been here twice, even. Fantastic, creative food served in an unpretentious space and offers BYOB! That is all you really need to know! The scallop "bonus" is the stuff that foodie dreams are made of, and in fact, I often find myself daydreaming about this when I'm hungry. Who knew a scallop in roasted mayo could be so freaking delicious? I was served the squash soup both times I've been here, and it so great. It tastes nothing like any squash soup I've tried to make at home. The last time I was here I had tried rabbit for the first time, and it was tasty! I'd definitely eat it again. This is also the first restaurant that I have ever tried uni, in a grilled cheese, nonetheless. But the star of my two-time Boinsoiree dining experience would have to be the lamb dish I had. I never liked lamb much until recently, but this dish made me LOVE lamb. The plate included a piece of lamb sausage, and then maybe lamb tenderloin? It was cooked very rare, and literally melted in my mouth. It was incredible, really. I would save up some money (or use your recently purchased groupon) and buy a couple bottles of your favorite wine, and make a reservation. You are in for a treat- a long, leisurely meal where your only job is to keep the conversation flowing, as the waiters keep your byob wine flowing.
