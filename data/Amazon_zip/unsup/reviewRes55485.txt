I went to Piccolo Sogno with a very snobby foodie friend and the restaurant exceeded his expectations. Yay!We had made 8:30 reservation on Thursday night but decided to show up an hour before because we were starving. The hostess was very understanding and sat us within 15 minutes. We also run into a friend's father who paid for our drinks at the bar. Another Yay! So, just like that the restaurant was full of sophisticated Chicagoans with an old world charm. The waiter, an older Italian man with a heavy Italian accent, absolutely took care of us. The food and the wine was what you would expect from the former chefs at Coco Pazzo. Great place to charm a date. Absolutely have to go next door for a desert cigar!
