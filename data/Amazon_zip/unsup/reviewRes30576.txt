Went here with a few girlfriends. Best thing on the menu: sweet potato fries. Ordered the veggie cheeseburger with avocado- naise. The avocado- naise sauce was very good. The veggie cheese burger was decent. Had peanut butter chocolate cake. Very tasty. Large piece. Would recommend. Good service. Prompt. Clean. Gets crowded. Street parking.
