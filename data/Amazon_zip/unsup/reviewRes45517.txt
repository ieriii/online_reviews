Is that library in the middle of the bar? Is that Oscar Wilde in the library? Nope, it's just some skinny hipster. The place has a pretty cool atmosphere; the library in the middle is a nice touch and would probably be a cozy place in the winter. However, the food is pretty average. I went for brunch and ordered some French toast, it was a little over done, but I've had worse. I also had a bite of their burger which was pretty decent. Service was average and prices were about what you would expect ($10 range). Overall, if you're in the mood for some standard pub fare, then Wilde's is a decent option.
