I go for certain items that are outstanding, but overall I'm not that impressed. Limited selection and overpriced, but what they have is good.  Their brownies are excellent. When they have them (less than half the times I've sought them) their toasted bagel chips are great. Good humus selection to go with the bagel chips. They downgraded their cheese department, and are good at providing bad advice on cheeses, but still have some good cheeses. Their wine selection is exotic with occasional good deals. Good soup for lunch. Decent sushi.
