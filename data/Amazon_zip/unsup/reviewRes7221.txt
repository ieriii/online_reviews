Sapori Trattoria has turned into me and my wife's favorite date spot. We were impressed from day one: the service was fast, the table was ready for us, and the food was amazing. And each and every time we've gone has been as good as the first time. One of the reviewers here mentioned that he did not like his food to stalk him when he goes home. But the mailings are one of the reasons why we always come back! It definitely shows something when a restaurant sends you gift certificates on your birthday. It's almost like dining at a friend's restaurant- we always know that we'll get great food, service and personal attention.
