Awesome. Order the bone marrow spread for your starter. Order the pork belly for your entree. Order much more if you're a glutton.  Atmosphere is very dark, hip, fashionable, exclusive, and chic. Throw on some nice wear, grab your lovely, and make sure you have reservations. I'm not sure if I would come back here with my friends, this is a date place. Prices aren't bad, expect to spend close to $100 if you're taking your date out. That's prefix, entrees, and wine.  Enjoy.
