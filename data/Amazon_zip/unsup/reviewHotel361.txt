Ideal location but one MAJOR problem - it's a Travelodge! My husband and I, along with my mother drove from Detroit for a weekend getaway and stayed in the hotel one night. The lobby smelled like someone's bathroom, the night shift desk clerk barely spoke any English, and the hallways were badly in need of new carpet and paint. The room was small, for having two double beds. Our bed was made and had freshly laundered sheets, but the bathroom was DISGUSTING - it looked as if it hadn't been cleaned in several days! We were too tired to complain so we didn't say anything. When we returned home, we called Travelodge's 800 number and reported our problems. We also filed a dispute with our credit card company. If the hotel was a better brand name and had better management, it would be perfect! One more thing...we hated being ripped off for parking, but the hotel garage is the only place to park :( Only if you MUST stay downtown on a limited budget would I recommend staying here.
