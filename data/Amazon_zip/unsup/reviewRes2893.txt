Not much to add. I will say it's the best service in town (maybe second to Ria.) They treat everyone with the same class and respect and don't really distinguish between regulars and special occasion people (we were the latter.) They do a great time with timing and pacing, you never feel rushed or interrupted. Like a lot of the high-end LEYE places you are served by a team, but they pull it off better than anyone else. Perfect for intimate gatherings where you want to enjoy the company of your guests and some of the best food in the world.
