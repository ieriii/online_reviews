Vegetarians, beware. Gorgeous, rustic decor welcomes you. Every wall has a giant painting of a different very plump pig with very short legs. This is not a dainty "girl food" establishment. I am lucky that I dined out with three gentlemen on this evening, and got to try plenty of things. The ordering system is perfect: you just tell the server everything you want throughout the meal, and when they've heard from everyone at the table, they course it out for you. Also, they'll tell you if you've ordered enough. What we ordered: Chef's selection of oysters Chef's selection of three hams Striped bass Spicy pork rinds Charcuterie plate Sweetbread Pote Farm chicken (half chicken with summer sausage + frites) Beets Waffle with fresh strawberries and honey butter Plum Crisp with sour cream sorbet And beer. Lots of beer. There was not a bad dish in the bunch; each arrival at the table was better than the last. It's a dream. Can't wait for Round 2!
