YUM. This place rocks. Unique concept, great food, plentiful wine, and very reasonable prices. I would recommend it for a date, for a group, pretty much any time. I went on a Thursday night with the boyfriend, and we were shocked to see how crowded it was. There was a wait, but they will take your number and you can go to any of the nearby bars. They have a bar, too, but it was super crowded. Once seated, we decided to just let the waiter bring whatever he wanted. We always find that this is a great method with tapas style dining, and it did not fail. Our waiter was great, and he had us rolling out of there, we were so full. The thing that stands out the most was the pate, which I would normally never order, but was delicious. My next favorite was definitely the roasted squash and faro salad, which I am desperately trying to recreate at home so I can eat it every day! The bf was a big fan of the seared octopus, which was super unique and had a perfect horseradish sauce. The only thing I wouldn't get again was the pecorino spaghetti because it was a bit peppery for our taste. Also, the polenta ragu was good, but didn't stand out amongst the others. Next time I'll definitely save space for some pizza. Mmmmm, I'm hungry thinking about it...
