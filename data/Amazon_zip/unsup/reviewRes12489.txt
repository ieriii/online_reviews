I love love love Piece pizza! It's my favorite pizza in Chicago by far! So many places in Chicago make thin crust pizza with that cracker-type crust, which, if you like it, I guess is fine. I don't like it, however, so Piece is the place for me.  Piece also has excellent customer service. My husband and I ordered a take-out pizza from them a few nights ago, and when we went to pick it up, they said the green peppers we had ordered on the pizza had gotten burnt, so they were re-making the pizza and it would be a few extra minutes. We said no problem and went back out to the car and drove around the block. When we got back, they handed us our pizza and we rushed home to eat it while it was hot because we were super hungry. When we got home and opened the box, we realized they had accidentally given us the original pizza with the burnt peppers. We figured we could live with it, but felt we were owed a pizza, because now we had a pizza that was cold because it was so old, and had burnt peppers. I pulled out my phone to call them, and found they had already called me to let us know that they thought they had made a mistake. Had I checked my phone earlier on the ride home, we could have returned and gotten our corrected pizza. When I called them back, they were quick to offer us a free pizza the next time we ordered. I was happy that they made it a hassle-free experience and had tried to contact us before we called them. Thanks, Piece!
