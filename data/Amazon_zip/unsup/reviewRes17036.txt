oh MAN. i first visited here in march with a couple of girlfriends. the ambiance is very exclusive and hush-hush. must be if you're a speakeasy, right? the plush high-backed chairs add to the posh effect. you'll definitely feel like you're here on a rendezvous. the ladies and i gossiped, poured our hearts out, and them proceeded to drink our sorrows away with one of the punch drinks.  each cocktail is $12, a bit steep, but those punch bowls? $30 and will certainly get the job done. my second visit was with the boo. after indulging in tacos across the street, we snuggled up in two tall chairs and took on our espionage personas. we discussed worldly topics and the very mundane. i highly recommend violet hour if only for the lovely feeling you get pretending to be sneaky.
