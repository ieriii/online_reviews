Everything on the brunch menu is amazing and the drinks are even better. I love love love the biscuits and gravy, but the crab eggs benedict is a close second. The service at the bar is perfect, but one star off for the table service. I find it surprising that this place can keep their Michelin star with the lack of attentiveness from their servers. Long waits are worth it if you can get a seat at the bar!
