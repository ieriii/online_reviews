The kabobs, the flaming cheese, the Greek salad, the tzatzki and the fresh pitas... the food is simple but always amazing. It's fun to come here and order a ton of food to split because it's so reasonably-priced. The Greek beer, Hellas, is on the stronger side and complements the food well. If I come here for lunch, I split a beer with my friend! And girls, come here for a taste of the boys club at high noon. Or rather, the boys are more akin to old men. Still, it's unbelievably fun to crash the party and collect the appreciative stares! The best part about Greek Islands is that everyone is always laughing, sharing anecdotes, just having a great time. All of the Olive Garden commercials are probably filmed here, actually. Because I'm not buying that families could be so happy sharing microwaved bowls of pasta! Yep-- the Greeks perfected the art of bringing families together over good food and drink thousands of years ago, and I enjoy my time in their "home". Free valet parking, y'all. And the butter mints by the door?? Unbelievable. Grab two, or five, before the hostess busts you. Even my Greek friends agree that Greek Islands is the most authentic of all the Greektown joints. Opa!
