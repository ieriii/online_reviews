The sweet chocolate chip cream cheese sends the first ever salad bar in Chicago over the top! After trying just about everything laid out on the salad bar, I chose to dive into the Gruntburger. The fried onions and special cheese sauce on this burger turned my stomach into a bottomless pit of pure happiness. I highly recommend rj grunts if you are looking to chow down a great burger. Their burger efforts easily crack my top 5 list for best burgers in both cook and dupage counties.
