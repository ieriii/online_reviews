LOL, Longman & Eagle. I'm so damn floored by this restaurant that I don't know what to say. It's my favorite restaurant ever and it has the best bourbon whiskey selection I've ever seen. I went to the Night Moves beer pairing/tasting and it was one of the best meals I've ever had. Six stars the end good night.
