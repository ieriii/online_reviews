Sabatino's is like a classic black and white movie. You can always count on it. I brought a lady friend here on our first date and it couldn't have been a better experience. They sat us in a private booth (hint, hint if you're looking for romance) and the night went uphill from there. The pizza bread is top notch! We shared a special appetizer and each got a glass of prosecco. Our food was amazing; I got the classic lasagna and my date got their gnocchi both of which were delicious. Every entree comes with a soup and salad so be prepared for a big meal. We ended the night with cappuccino's and tiramisu. We hadn't set out to have a three hour meal but it turned out that way. We took our time and enjoyed ourselves which was great because our server was attentive but never rushed us once. I picked this place because I know it has longevity and I can go back for many years to come. We were also some of the youngest people there by 20+ years which we didn't mind at all. Excellent restaurant and dining experience!
