Crisp automatically gets 5-stars because of the size of their water cups! I am a very thirsty person, and nothing annoys me more than when restaurants give you those small plastic cups that you keep having to refill. These cups are like those huge 32 oz cups you get at the drink fountain at a gas station.  But the food! The food is simple but oh-so-flavorful. I had the buddha bowl and the seoul sassy fried chicken. I had dinner with a friend I haven't seen in a while, and there were moments where we fell silent because we were busy savoring our food! I would go as far as saying that I prefer Crisp over Great Seas chicken wings because Crisp isn't completely overwhelmed with sauce like Great Seas. Extra bonus because Crisp is A LOT closer. If I had it my way, I'd eat Crisp at least 4 times a week. i do, after all, have my health and wallet to worry about!
