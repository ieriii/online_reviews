I tried it again because I kinda got dragged there. I hated it again. I cannot stress how pointless and counterintuitive it is to stick some crappy fries into a box and jam a hot dog in there. I had to rip the box apart. LOL. The fries have not gotten better. It looked like the problem was old oil. They were not fresh or hot at all. The car hop is nice... but the food is blah and way too overpriced.
