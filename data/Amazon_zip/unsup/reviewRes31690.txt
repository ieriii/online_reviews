I've been here plenty of times but each time I go back the service and food get crappier and crappier. The drinks are more watered down each time I come and this last time there was not only a fly in my dish but also someones nasty hair. I think its time to go back to basics Nana. Very disappointed in a restaurant that Bridgeport badly needs!!!
