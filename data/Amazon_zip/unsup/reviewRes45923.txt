Delicious! I've been here a few years ago and recently made it back. My fondest memory was of their delicious desserts. However, this time it's their food that makes my tummy growl. I had their cream of chicken with mushrooms and it is to die for! Not overly creamy, but just enough to satisfy your taste buds, the touch of mushrooms makes it more flavorful. (I really enjoy the sourdough bread and that they offered wheat and/or white!) For entree I got their Chicken Fettucine Alfredo and side salad (lunch option until 5p) and wow the portion of the alfredo is huge, I was thinking wowzers what if I got the dinner portion, I could feed three of me! The creaminess was a bit much for me so I decided to swap with my boyfriend who got the Sunday Pasta, which is absolutely fantastic, the rib meat and mushrooms just hits the spot with the marinara sauce! (I reccommend it for the spaghetti lovers.) We were both extremely happy with our dishes once we switched, but were so full from the soup and big portions, we sadly couldn't fit in dessert. Bummer, definitely next time. Love the decor and our view through the window was gorgeous (thanks to the outside trees with Christmas lights)!
