Classy hotel. Standard room w/ 2 double beds. City view. 25th floor. Shopping to the left and right and everywhere in between. Just step outside! What made me fall in love? The historic POOL. I made it a point to buy a bikini before I arrived. It was mighty chilly outside and this Cali girl seriously hates being cold, but the indoor pool was marvelous!! Can't wait to come back!
