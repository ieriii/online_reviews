I stopped in with my party crew after a disappointing outing at Soldier Field to commiserate and to put a positive finish on a cold, cold day. The egg-lemon soup immediately put me in a better mood and the salmon appetizer and artisanal pizzas that followed were simply delicious. We all split an assortment of dessert items and there wasn't anything to complain about. Good work Artopolis. I can now look forward to next year for the Bears with a full and happy disposition.
