Can't say too much more than, YUM! I had a late lunch here Monday of this week. There was a pretty decent crowd but not enough to really judge the service. Our waitress was attentive and they had no problem with us lingering a long time which was refreshing. Excellent menu. Creative combos. One of the better restaurants in Chicago, hands down.
