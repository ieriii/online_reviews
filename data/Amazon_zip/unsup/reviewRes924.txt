*5 stars for a fast food joint* After hearing about Hot Doug's forever, a friend and I decided to go on a Friday that we had off. As we walked up, there were about 8 guys already in line ~20 minutes before opening. Our wait went by fairly quickly, and we were soon inside...to wait yet again, but this time to order. There's quite a few choices on the menu! What I got: The Cheesy Atomic: Spicy jack cheese, stuffed pork sausage with spicy passion fruit mayo and habanero jack cheese. My favorite - great flavor, and the right amount of heat from the various peppers thrown in the cheese and mayo. Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage: with truffle aioli, foie gras mousse, and fleur de sel (fancy salt). I found the foie gras on the duck sausage to be there more for texture than flavor, and the sausage itself was fairly bland. That's to be expected for duck I suppose, given my past experience with duck sausage. I think this would greatly benefit if Doug were to saute the foie gras a bit to warm it up. Norm Crosby: a hot dog with beef, pork, and garlic, served Chicago style. Didn't really notice much of a difference between this and a normal hot dog given all of the condiments thrown on top. Duck Fat Fries: only served on Fridays & Saturdays. Delicious. Spectacular! Some of the best fries I've had. Overall, I'm happy with the food I got at Hot Doug's, and I know my friend is in love with the place and keeps going back any chance he gets. I don't think it was utterly amazing...but it's a fast food place. That said, Hot Doug's is one of the top choices in the city for your favorite fast food/junk food, which is why I give it 5 stars for a fast food joint. I think it's worth a wait - but not the 2+hrs some people have been waiting. If you want to go, get there early on a weekday and (preferably Friday to get your hands on some duck fat fries) and chow down!
