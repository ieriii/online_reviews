this place was horrible, i made a reservation for my wie and I, after walking by and seeing how amazing it looked from the outside, but after trying it out last night the atmosphere was the only GOOD thing about it. The idea of the restaurant is great, but the food sucked. The harvest table is full of COLD salads and vegatables, the meats were OKAY, and the drinks are way over priced. The service was wonderful, but like someone else stated...$200 later and only getting the meal and one drink each...I should have been wowed.This place is for rich hipsters that convince themselves they're having a good meal in downtown Chicago even though they could have had a better meal out outback steakhouse...Save your money and go else where.
