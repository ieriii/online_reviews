I was there for the first time on Sunday after having heard about it and was not at all impressed. The food was bland, the prices are ok based on the size of the portions, the tables and booths are too small to eat or even hold all plates, flasses and silverware and it's quite dark. The bruschetta was served on soft bread not toasted which no one liked.There was only ONE server for lunch hour on a Sunday and i have to say was doing pretty good considering how busy it was. My son was completely bored and wanted some sunlight, we ended up taking all the food home because we didnt like it and ordered Chinese instead. I have had better Italian in Chicago. I will NOT be going back.
