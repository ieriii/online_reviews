I went here while I was in Chicago for work with my co-workers. The service was a let down ( the server didn't even take my drink order, I had to ask twice) but the food was great. The Shrimp tempura with the garlic aiole was to die for but the Shaking Beef which by description seemed to be the most interesting, was a let down. Overall, the large open floor plan made it very noisy so I wouldn't suggest this place for a romantic dinner. If you are looking for a night out with friends, this would be a good option as they have a rather large bar.
