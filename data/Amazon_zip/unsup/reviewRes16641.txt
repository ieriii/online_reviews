I am a firm believer in the theory that different restaurants serve different purposes. Some are very good for one thing, but are a massive fail for others. I have been to Carnivale 5 or 6 times. You go to Carnivale with a group of rowdy friends, for a celebration or for a pre-New Years Eve dinner. You do not go to Carnivale with business clients that you need to hear speak or on a first date. The food here is very good, the drinks are even better. I've had most of the appetizers and ceviches, and all are good choices. I'd skip the guacamole though - I'm a guac snob and it's never made quite how I like it (not like at Adobo Grill where I can micromanage the poor guy manning the tableside guac). I've never left Carnivale anything less than tipsy...good times.  Carnivale is always great so long as you aren't expecting a quiet dinner out.
