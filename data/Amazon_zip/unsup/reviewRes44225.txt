I was in town without Husby and decided to meet an old friend for dinner. He suggested this place since we both like sushi. The host was rather abrupt/rude to me and then assumed that I was waiting for another woman. When I came back from the bathroom, my guy friend was there getting hit on by the same host, who looked surprised that he was my dinner date. We sat down and were served by a very efficient but unfriendly server. I ordered a martini and it did not taste quite what I expected but it was strong.  Since we had not seen each other, we kept chatting without choosing an entree and each time our server looked annoyed, even though there were still empty tables. Once our food arrived, the sushi made up for the service. It was fresh, buttery, and the perfect portion. It was expensive but I do not know of any really good sushi places that are cheap. I went with a bowl of rice with sashimi (chirashi) and my DP had a few rolls. I also really enjoyed the jalapeno miso soup, which was wonderfully spicy. Over all, I thought it was great - ambiance and food. BUT they certainly need more hospitable staff!
