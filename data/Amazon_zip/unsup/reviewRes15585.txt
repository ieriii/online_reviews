After a completely indulgent evening, there was a need for some recovery food. I was requiring a multitude of flavors and temperatures to ease myself into a long work week. So, I ordered a shrimp cocktail, BLT wrap and the fried chicken/rib combo (I did mention this was recover food right?) So the cocktail sauce that came with the shrimp? Uh, yeah, it was good. Lots of horseradish, and I didn't feel the need to add any additional Tabasco. The BLT wrap was HUGE! I happily ate half of a half and was super happy. This flour tortilla was supple and I liked how there was a smokiness to every bite because of the little bit of char. An aromatic delight for sure.  And then I took a nap. Dinner time! Reheated the chicken and ribs for me and my Honey. You get a choice of two sides with this, I got the cole slaw and pasta with olive oil (not offered on the menu, but I asked). The cole slaw was pretty good, I have to admit (!?!) I'm a bit of a slaw snob, being that my Mom makes the best and all. Creamy, flavorful and not too vinegary, very nice. Fried chicken was good enough, salty and re crisped nicely in the oven. My Honey loved the ribs, he let me have one and I must agree, they're pretty tasty.  Calo will always have a place in m heart for saving this girl from dayafterdom:-)
