This is by far my favorite place to go for pizza in Chicago. The crust is consistently thick enough where it's not soggy like some Neapolitans can be in the middle, but not overly thick like cardboard. And it's got a great chewiness factor. It's fantastic. My fave combo so far is a white with mashed potatoes and sausage. All I can say is DANG. Seriously. Mashed potatoes on a garlicky pizza with Italian sausage is freaking insanely awesome. Other combinations we've tried were anchovies and clam on white, meatball and ricotta on plain, bbq chicken, clam and bacon on white... all were good. You really can't go wrong with any topping.  The atmosphere is super casual, but it's loud, especially during Karaoke Thursdays. There is a big selection of beer here so if you're a fan of beer, I'm pretty sure you'll find something you'd like.
