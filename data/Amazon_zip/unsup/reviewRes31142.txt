You know that Barenaked Ladies song where they talk about how if they had a million dollars they'd still eat Kraft mac n' cheese every day? Well if I had a million dollars I'd still eat Sunda every day. For reals. So, I generally try to avoid these trendier restaurants because I think they typically bring down my reputation, but I compromised on the eve of a friend's birthday. We arrived on the earlier side (you know, for the early bird special) but I actually didn't mind that because it wasn't overcrowded or loud yet. By the time we finished however the bar was packed.  There were 6 of us so we got to try a ton of stuff on the menu. I am not fibbing when I say every dish was phenomenal. We started with this coconut shrimp type appetizer, of which I could probably eat an entire vat-full. Then we tried a roll that our server said was most similar to a dragon roll; honey barbecue ribs (my favorite), a pasta dish with beef, the adobo pork belly, a duck roll, Filipino-style pot stickers, and last but certainly not least: the sea bass. The sea bass was out of this world. Drinks were delicious as well - lots of hand-crafted martinis, etc.  Overall, I loved the atmosphere and we had a great time. Our server was a bit MIA sometimes - we had to flag down a manager to order another round of drinks - but he was otherwise knowledgeable and efficient.
