Decided to try Tank shortly after I moved to Chicago. I had the pho dac biet; it was bland and the meat was tough. My boyfriend had the lemongrass vermicelli noodle bowl and the meat looked disgusting and tasted even worse. There is a lot on the menu so I decided to try it again and skip the pho or vermicelli noodles. I went for the seafood banh canh (my favorite dish) and it was worse than the two other dishes! The carrots were barely cooked and flavorless, the cabbage was soggy and had no crunch, and the broth was bland (it definitely did not taste or look like any typical banh canh I've had before). The seafood in it was decent, but it's not hard to take that out of the package and put it in boiling broth. I will never, ever come back to this restaurant again. For pho I would stick to Pho888 and for vermicelli noodle I'd stick with New Saigon.
