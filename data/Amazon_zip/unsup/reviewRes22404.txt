If all the dictators, terrorists, violent criminals, and Rosie O' Donnell sat down to a 20 course meal by Lao Sze Chuan...the world would be a much better place. Lao Sze Chuan is soulful, spicy, comforting, authentic, and super good. Located on a perfect corner in China Town, one can take in China Town for a while if there's a lengthy wait. Or you can just stroll around this interesting cultural area to help your food digest. The interior is busy, bright, and full of amazing smells. For the food, I can only speak for a few items. These items however, are outlandish. The dried chili chicken is almost unsharable. It's so good I want to eat it all. Leftovers? Not possible, you'll eat em' in the car or as a late night snack. Or your significant other or family members will find out about it and it erase it's existence. Their Mapo Tofu is hella spicy and will punch you in the face with flavor. Lao has ruined suburb Chinese for me, but I'm happy it did. I was continually getting burned by these Chinese restaurants that are unauthentic and forced to appease the American pallet. Most of the dishes at these kinds of places are loaded with cornstarch, and everything is unbearably breaded. Thank you Lao Sze Chuan. Next time I go to here, it's gonna be tough not ordering the same thing. But I'm excited to try all the other great items they have to offer.
