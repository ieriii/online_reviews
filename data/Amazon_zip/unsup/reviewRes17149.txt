OK, the food here is my favorite Indian food in Chicago. Normally, that alone is enough for 5 stars, but the service has been so terrible on multiple occasions that I simply cannot give it 5 stars. I can't remember the number of times I've had to ask a bus boy for an additional item or for the check because the wait staff was just nowhere to be seen. Then the wait staff often seems to get upset if you ask any sort of question as well. I love their palak paneer and any of their tandoor cooked meats always turn out moist and delicious. The spice balances seem very good overall, with a lot of items having a nice spice to them without it overpowering other flavors. If you're fine with taking some extra time waiting around for your wait staff, I highly recommend India House, as I've never been let down by the food.
