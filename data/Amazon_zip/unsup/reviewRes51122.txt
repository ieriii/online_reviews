Dinner last night at Big Jones was great! I had the crab cakes with corn maque choux- so tasty! Crab cakes were like fluffy pillows of crab meat over freshly shucked crunchy corn, okra, tomatoes, garlic and tasso ham. My husband had the crispy sweet breads- so delicious!! Even our 4 year old liked them! The kids meal was pretty great too- fresh chicken tenders- no frozen junk here! Served with fresh made potato chips, MJ ate every bite! My husband and I both had the shrimp and grits. I can't begin to say how great it was! Superbly creamy and savory grits, perfectly cooked shrimp, more tasso ham and sliced mushrooms. Perfection! We also sampled some of their summer cocktails- i can't remember the name of mine- Charleston something or other made with Sweet Tea Vodka and Lime juice and Ginger Beer I think- fantastic! Bright and refreshing. Our server was really sweet and attentive. Some other reviews said it isn't a place for kids, but i disagree. MJ was one of 2 kids there just last night and the staff was very accommodating. They have a kids menu so clearly that's just not the case. We thoroughly enjoyed our meal and experience! We'll be back!
