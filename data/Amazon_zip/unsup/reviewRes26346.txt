Came here with a Groupon. Ambiance is cozy (very dark and romantic though I went with my sister and had a great time so no need to just go for a date.) Cheese fondue is absolutely delicious. Entrees were fun to cook yourself. However, the chocolate fondue was less than impressive. Go for the cheese fondue and the fun and don't feel obligated to pay the extremely high price for the rest of the meal.
