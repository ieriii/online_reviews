This is one of my favorite places in the city. The vegetable dishes are fantastic, and as a vegetarian, I really appreciate that. I love eating ADD style, so tapas is fun for me. I love the spinach with apples and currants--I could eat it every day and not get tired of it. They've elevated it from a simple-sounding dish to a work of art with their mastery of the cooking method. The incredibly high heat imparts the veggies with the taste of the pan (there's actually a term for it in Chinese) that is really hard to achieve at home. I also love the octopus in potatoes, the bacalao croquettes, patatas bravas, and pan con tomate. The most recent time that I went, we had a dessert called Peas and Carrots--carrot cake with sweet pea ice cream, which is tastier than it sounds. Our server was wacky and terrific. Can't wait to go back again!
