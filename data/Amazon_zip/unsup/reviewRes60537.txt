good american food (especialy the burger) --- the beignets are great also --- be sure to ask for the window seating looking out to michigan avenue since it has the best view (especially if you are trying to get lucky with your date) --- plenty of space --- i would have given them 4 stars if they took reservations because there is always a wait.everyone deserves chances so i will occasionally re-visit establishments that did not get favorable reviews from me in hope that they have addressed the issues and will revise my views accordingly
