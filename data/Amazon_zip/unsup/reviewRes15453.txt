Calo's is our go-to Italian restaurant in the 'hood. Everything here is good, starting with the pizza bread they give you right when you sit down. I've never had a pasta dish that left me wanting more, their thin crust pizza is pretty spot-on and you really can't beat that Sun-Thurs full slab of ribs deal (choice or soup or salad, pasta or potato AND the slab!!). Go here on a date or with a big group, you won't be disappointed.
