I wish I could give a Alliance a higher review... but their cupcakes are just too overpriced! My husband and I ordered 2 dozen cupcakes for our baby shower, half vanilla, half chocolate. The chocolate cupcakes were absolutely delicious!! Moist and decadent. The vanilla were just okay. But it turns out that they charged 3 dollars a cupcake (!) I was hoping that we would get some kind of discount because we were ordering in bulk, but no luck there. I'd recommend this place for a snack, but not for catering. The price is just too high.
