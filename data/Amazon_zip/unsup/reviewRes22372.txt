"negative": Food is ok, not great, just ok. I have had much better. First Chinese restaurant I have been to that doesn't offer crispy aromatic duck (Pecking style, with rice pancakes, spring onions, and hoisin sauce or sweet bean sauce). Not even boneless duck. 5 min to be seated 15 minutes between first attempt to ask for the check and the second reminder service is terrible. I understand that it was a "rush hour". but it doesn't justify poor service "positive" quant atmosphere "total" never going back to that restaurant and do not recommend anyone to go there.
