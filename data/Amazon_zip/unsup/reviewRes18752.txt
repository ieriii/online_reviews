With so many four-star reviews gracing this place, I hate to add one more, but a little more effort could have thrown it over the top. The bar has a very cool feel to it already, but the little known game room in the back was the best. Here you'll find a basement decor complete with shuffleboard, a pinball machine and board games.  The beer list was pretty impressive serving some old favorites as well as some harder to find brews. You'd be hard-pressed for a lack of options on the beer menu. As for the food, I had heard so much about their burgers I thought I would go all out and order their "Hangover" burger. Popping in at what is certainly 2,500 calories in one sitting, I consumed a burger with a fried egg, a slice of ham, bacon, onions, lettuce, ketchup, mustard and possibly mayonnaise. The burger was tremendously good, but I could feel it crawling through my heart immediately afterward. Overall, the burgers were delicious but eat at your own risk. The service left something to be desired as we waited almost an hour for our food (hence the lack of 5 stars.) Overall, this place was fun, not crowded and offered great beer and good food selections. Rock on!
