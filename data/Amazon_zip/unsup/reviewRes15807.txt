Good dependable Italian food. When you are in the mood for a relaxed and warm atmosphere and dont want or need the pretense of $20 pasta dishes with one shrimp and scallop thrown on top then this is the place to go on the northside.  Prices are reasonable for what you get and the portions are generous. Free parking to boot.
