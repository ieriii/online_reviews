Hmmmm I guess all the reviews regarding the bar and the rooftop should have been a dead give away that this is a place to socialize-not for eating. I enjoy dining at these concept restaurants and I am a girl who likes to eat. The service seemed to be a "tasting" of gourmet items prepared by chefs. On the day we went we were offered roasted duck breast (which I read about and was excited to try-hmm not exciting) and the usual fare of chicken, salmon and meats. The harvest table were mainly fancy salads the kind where i wanted to take small portions and place it between two slices of bread to make a sandwich. We dined with my boyfriend's family who had nieces ages 4-6 and the restaurant charged for their seat. I would return for drinks, but would perhaps visit the other similar restaurants nearby for dinner.
