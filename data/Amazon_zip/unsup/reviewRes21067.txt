WOW! I'm from Guadalajara, where "tortas ahogadas" come from, and I have to say that I'm impressed. I've tried them at several places around the city, but when I found Xoco, it was like taking a trip back to Guadalajara! The flavor is very authentic and it's as good as it's going get here in Chicago. After trying the torta ahogada for the first time, I have been back countless times, most of them just getting the same torta, it's fricking addicting, and I miss Guadalajara. However; I have tried most of the tortas on the menu, and they are all amazing. The pepito and the pibil stand out, as well as the green salsa and the orgasmic guacamole! I was there yesterday, and I'm already planning on going there tomorrow. And hopefully the day after that. thanks for the flashbacks Rick bayless!!!
