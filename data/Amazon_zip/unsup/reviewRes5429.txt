What can I say, The Purple Pig is pretty awesome. Good food and great wine selection. I took my family here when they were in town and they loved it. Its a good place if you want to share dishes because they are very reasonably priced and you could almost treat things as if they are tapas because of the portion sizes on some of some dishes. The only thing that I didn't like was that they have some shared tables meaning that you could potentially sit next to someone not from your party. The chairs are too close together and it probably would be better if they removed a seat or two from a table to give people more elbow room. Other than that I would say if your into trying new things you should definitely go because they always have a few interesting items on the menu.
