Located on Michigan Ave and just steps away from Millenium park, the Art Instiute of Chicago, and many other famous tourist attractions, the Gage is awesome. It definitely has a yuppie, pretentious style vibe, but the food is magnificent. They consider themselves a Gastropub that serves "upscale comfort food."  The decor is pretty vintage and I felt like I was dining with Blair Waldorf, Serena Vander Woodsen (sp), and one of their followers, just based on the decor/furnishings. I'm sure you could find your fellow Chuck Bass, Dan Humphrey, or Nate Archibald during Happy Hour, but Gossip Girl isn't reality. Haha. Items on the lunch menu include Mussels Vindaloo, Sesame Beets, a Salmon club, and a Ribeye sandwich. The sides looked awesome (think items such as crisp brie potatoes, fried zucchini and brussel sprouts with brie and bacon), but I wasn't too hungry and stuck with a half of the fire roasted chicken sandwich and the soup special, beans pured with a dallop of sour cream. The soup was super tasty and the chicken sando was bursting with spicy flavors and was covered in blue cheese. Yum! I was in heaven whilst sipping sophisticated wine, chatting it up about nothing too important with my girlfriends and enjoying the cuisine. The hostesses are super friendly, there's a coat check, and the waitress was attentive, knowledgeable, and friendly. I definitely plan to come back next visit. Only downfall is that it's a bit on the pricier side.
