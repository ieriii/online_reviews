Although it's pretty pricy, this place was great!!! The salad bar is huge, the meat is flavorful, and the service is excellent. Not to mention that you will never leave hungry. The meat servers walk around to every table offering meat, yet they still remembered exactly how we liked ours cooked... even though they were serving to 40 other people at the same time! They were able to accommodate us and make a special batch of mashed potatoes without garlic with no problem. One thing I will mention though is that although the salad bar is large and very good, if you are a vegetarian it is your only option. Loved it!
