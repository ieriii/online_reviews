Not a whole lot to add. We waited between an hour and a half and two hours on a mid-June Friday afternoon. Was the food and the experience worth it? Yes, I enjoyed the dogs. And talking to people in line was a good experience. Would I do it again? No, but I'm glad I did. It was a cool Chicago experience.
