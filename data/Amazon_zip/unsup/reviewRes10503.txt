If only I had a second stomach, or skipped lunch before coming here for dinner. Sit outside if you can, the patio feels so private and elegant despite being right off the road. The options for the antipasti alone made my mouth start watering, but due to previous indulgence that day, decided to skip it and save room for dessert instead. My sweet tooth again got the best of me. Our waiter was prompt and knowledgeable, recommended the braised short ribs and Spaghetti neri "frutti di mare."  The food came out very quickly. Neither was disappointing, both were overwhelmingly flavorful. Very few, even high standing, Italian restaurants include so many mussels and clams in their neri, but this was plentiful and perfectly cooked. No rubbery taste to the calamari and the veg. with the short ribs were perfectly cooked, no bitter taste to the spinach. During our panna cotta allo zafferano dessert it began to drizzle and our waiter rushed over to us, offered to move our remaining dessert and wine to the bar where we finished our meal just in time to miss the downpour that quickly followed. Outstanding experience! Cannot wait to go back, might even stop in just for a pizza (which looked amazing!) and glass of wine for a quick meal!
