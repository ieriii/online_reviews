I hate Mexican food. I have my entire life. It's amazing that Mayan palace converted me into someone who now craves chips salsa and guac on a regular basis. First of all, when you walk in, you're family to these people. Everyone there was so excited to greet me I felt embarrassed for not knowing their names. If you go on a slower night, you are immediately seated and before your server finishes greeting you, you have a basket of hot chips to scoop up the bowl of homemade salsa that seemed to come out of no where. Order a margarita, best I've had and they are very generous with their patron. The servings are gigantic and perfectly prepared. The restaurant is cozy, good for a date or night out with friends. I'm OC and don't trust many places as far as cleanliness goes, and this place is imaculate. ( you can even see the kitchen) If you like great food, go here. If you don't normally like Mexican food, go here.
