This place is definitely somewhere you should go for a great conversation to be paired with good drinks. There sustenance menu is also filled with great choices and I definitely recommend the artisenal cheeses. The staff is always willing to give you recommendations as well if you can't decide on one of their many drinks. It also has the potential to make or break your date. The reason why is because Of the few, but important, codes that the Violet Hour lives by... No cellphones, no cheap trashy beer, no college style mixed drinks. If you or you're date use your phone as a crutch to fill on silences or avoid contact, this will become quickly apparent. If your date only drinks PBR or doesn't know how to appreciate a finely crafted Old Fashioned, this will also become quickly apparent. What I'm trying to get at is that this prohibition era, speakeasy styled place quickly sets an amazing atmosphere for real human conversation. If you're a person of substance, you'll thrive in this environment, if you're a shallow sycophant -then probably not.
