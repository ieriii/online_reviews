this place was my first experience with deep dish chicago style pizza. a small deep dish pizza was more than enough for 2 people. it had a bit too much globby, gooey cheese for me but the sauce was fantastic. i ordered a side of meatballs because im always on the hunt for good meatballs. they were good but the leftover sauce was the best part. great ambiance.
