Buying a sandwich or a bowl of soup shouldn't come with the wait of a fine dining restaurant no matter how well known the chef's name on the door is. Xoco is set up like a quick serve joint so we kept thinking, "it can't be that much longer", but. it. will. be. that. much. longer. The service was certainly not in line with a fine dining restaurant, the host sucked and the cashier had the pathetic nature of an employee suffering in a system that is endlessly broken. After a 40 minute wait we were charged $15.50 for the 2 cans of beer we drank to kill the time. F that. My wife and I spend a lot on restaurants each week and I can tell you that there are too many good places to eat in Chicago to suffer this nonsense. And I have eaten at Xoco before, but as soon as we saw the price of the beer after the wait and bad service we ignored our intense hunger pains and went elsewhere to support a place that didn't feel like it was set up to abuse us. The repeated mewling of "sorry" from the cashier did not make the bad experience better.
