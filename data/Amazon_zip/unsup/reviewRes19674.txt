Ok im gonna let you in on a lil Jess interior desgin tip. I have this thing about rest's....it cant be the best of the best unless the food is off the hook and the decor makes me want to go home and re do my living room. HELLLLO coast (and the bongo room for that matter but thats another review another day) Yah i guess its slightly pricey but i dont mind paying a pretty penny for sushi, its when i dont i get a lil nervous...but this is some of the best sushi ive ever had...WAY better than japonais and japonais is up there on my list of sushi favs too!! The dragon roll is beyond amazing, they dont skip on the eel sauce and they have some AWESOME special rolls....the wait has always been suuuupppper nice and weve never had a problem with resos or getting a seat. I like in edgewater and im sure there are 1000 awesome sushi places to try between my place and coast yet somehow coast ALWAYS wins with me!!
