I am shamelessly a brisket fanatic and Chicago Q has some of the best I've ever tasted. Everything here is top notch. I anticipated that a weekend night would bring a long wait, so I went with the boyfriend on a Thursday night and we were seated right away. We loved the pickles and chips, had to refrain from asking for more so we didn't get full. Had those hush puppies with the bacon which were awesome. He had the pulled pork sandwich and I had the brisket sandwich, he reluctantly gave me a bite with some cole slaw. It was awesome. I really enjoyed their beer selection and he was loving the whiskey selection and service. Maybe one of the best parts of Chicago Q was our server. She was extremely friendly (not in the obnoxious, overly enthusiastic way), made great suggestions, and was always checking on us. Can't wait to go back!
