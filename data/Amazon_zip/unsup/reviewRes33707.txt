The Food: I've been a number of times and it's consistently been the best Italian in its price range I've ever had! Their menu is hand-written and changes frequently according to the availability of fresh ingredients.  The only complaint I can offer is that, on one occasion, the sauce on my friend's chicken alfredo was rather thin. I'll chalk that up to a matter of taste though, and given the great wine selection, the great dishes (try the bruschetta appetizer), and the mouth-watering desserts, I'll let it slide. ;) The Atmosphere: The dining room is tastefully decorated and classy. Definitely a date-worthy place. White tablecloths and candles. The Service: The servers are very helpful, attentive, and knowledgeable.
