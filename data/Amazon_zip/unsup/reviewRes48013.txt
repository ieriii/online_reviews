This is more like 3.5 stars, but I guess 3 will have to do. Went here on a recent Friday for an impromptu dinner. We were seated right away (party of 2) at 8 p.m. in the outdoor area. Started with a great glass of red wine from Austria and some chicken liver pate . Both were excellent. The pate was rich and creamy and was cut well by the fresh raspberries that were served on top. As a main dish I tried the pork belly. It was tender and flavorful. The service is really where they lose some stars. Our services was uninformative, unfriendly and scatty. The bus boy was great, always kept our water full, but our server was awkward and unhelpful. Also, the food was not timed well, not sure if that's a service issue or a kitchen issue. Not sure if I'd return to the Publican, perhaps for a group dinner where someone else does the picking, but I probably won't be rushing back.
