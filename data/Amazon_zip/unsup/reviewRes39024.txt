The wait is pretty long, but definitely worth it. You can either grab a drink at the bar or at the area around the back which makes the wait pretty easy. On my first trip I had the burger which I was not all that impressed by (the bacon and cheese were just a bit too much grease for me). Once I tried the rest of the menu, I was much happier. Be brave and order the bone marrow, it's delicious. The wild boar sloppy joe and roasted cauliflower entrees were good. I would suggest ordering a few of the small plates and some of the larger plates and then sharing. This food was not cheap, but for the price, it's more than worth it.
