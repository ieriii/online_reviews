I came home late from work on a weekday and was in the mood for pizza. I had a flyer from art of pizza, so we ordered a large thin crust veggie. The Pizza was $28 ouch, when the hell did pizza become so damn expensive. If i remember correctly pizza used to be a cheap alternative to eating out anyways...i did not feel like calling other places and ordered.The pizza did come relatively quickly. The pizza was terrible, it might be some of the worst pizza i ever had. The pizza had not taste, it was the most blend thing i ever ate. The thin crust was too hard. the only good thing about it was that the veggies/toppings seemed fresh, but THEY HAD NO TASTE!!!I don't know how their deep dish is, but after the crap i ate and how much i paid, i will never eat or order from thereArt of Pizza please stop putting flyers on my door, cause you suck!
