Everything from start to finish was great. From the bread at the beginning to the desert at the end. Fresh, hot, and tasty. Best carrot cake ever. Good deal being Monday evening and taking advantage of the 3 course prefix (able to chose anything from the menu almost) ) Great service. Couple things I took note of but not bothered by. When a restaurant has a full house.. It's going to be loud. The only other thing is a little cramped w the seating. You will know what your neighbors are up to.Overall:GREAT DINNER
