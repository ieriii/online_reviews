Had to try it because of all the reviews. I would rate it a B. I recently went to Alinea, which was by far, much better. Food was good my group had the Experience tasting menu. We got a reservation on a Sat. night, with short notice, which was cool. Smaller portions than Alinea. Big plates throws you off. The truffle oil popcorn is amazing. De-constructed Caesar salad was good. The next few courses were immemorable. The Wagu beef was good. Scallop and seafood were good, especially with the hidden roe. There was some delay in the kitchen though, which delayed us 30 minutes between courses, which was disappointing. Too bad the bill came with someone else's bar tab attached. When pointing out the errors, they only fixed one, and had to be sent back to fix it again. Good, not great.
