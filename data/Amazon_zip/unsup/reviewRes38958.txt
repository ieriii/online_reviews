Awesome menu and excellent execution. Went for lunch with coworkers and had a party of 12. The back room only had one other table of 4 and yet they refused to let us push two tables together to celebrate a coworker's last day with the company so our party was split into two and at tables on exact opposite sides of the room. It really blew. They never sat anyone at the other tables the entire time we were there and we told them we didn't care if our food came out at different times so as not to cause a rush with the kitchen, still denied. So for that, I'm giving 4 stars. The whiskey/bourbon selection was top-notch, I should add that. I would definitely go back with a party of 4 or less, no question.
