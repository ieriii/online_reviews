I mostly like the ambience fo this place. Just about every seat is s good one. For afterwork drinks, you definitely need to get there in teh 5 o'clock hour to get a good rooftop seat. The lemon ginger bourbon drink is the B-O-M-B. A few of those and you will be chatting it up with everyone who walks past. And the people I was with enjoyed the blueberry mojito also.  The bad part is that as the place gets more crowded, your server kind of disappears. At least mine did. We learned quickly that we had to order full rounds at a time because if she brought one or two drinks, it was 20-30 minutes before we saw her again. I can't comment on the food too much because we just had cheese platters. How can you screw up a cheese platter, right?  the other bad part is that I'm 5'8" and my legs and that weird pear-shaped table were not meshing well. Oh, and if you got there early to get a good seat after about 6pm, you start to feel eyes on you because your tabel is being stalked. ...like you can tell the standees are gauging how close you are to the bottom of your ginger bourbon thing and how many more drinks you might order before you leave. kinda creepy.  I'd definitely go back to ZED. Very hip. Very trendy. Good music piping throughthe speakers. And the ginger bourbon lemonade: 2 thumbs UP.
