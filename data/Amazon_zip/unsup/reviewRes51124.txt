Good place to bring parents! I really would give it 3.5 stars. I was living a block away from here long ago when it opened and it was soooo nice to have this in the neighborhood. Good crab cakes and really good french toast. I prefer this location to the other one on Washington. Parking can be kind of a pain sometimes but the prices are reasonable and I've never had to wait to eat here. Maybe for a few minutes once for brunch but that's all. It's hard to keep coming back here that much because Chicago is bursting with amazing restaurants and Wishbone is not high on my list of them but it's a good casual restaurant.
