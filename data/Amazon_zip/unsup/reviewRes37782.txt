Really love this place. The mussels are wa-bam great and outside of that, I just feel good when I'm here. I haven't even always had the best service, but I always go back. It's great. In fact, the reason I'm even posting this is because I'm going tonight and am so excited I am already thinking of it and thought of yelp :) One thing I'd not recommend is the duck reuben. It's kind of just like an even greasier regular reuben. Sorry, but after like 6 or 7 visits that's my only complaint :)
