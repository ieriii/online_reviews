I have been going here since it first opened. In the beginning it was a dream! Great prices, attentive service, beautiful presentation, and wonderful flavors! After their expansion, the food & service went down while the prices went up. They put some ugly, "hip" (scary) art on the walls, redo the menus every now and then, serve liquor, and think they can bs everything else.  Whhhhhhy?! It's like that innocent girl who went to Hollywood to be a star and now she's hookin' for $10. Will she ever get that innocence back? I still love you Indie Salad.
