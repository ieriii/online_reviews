I was pleasantly surprised by this restaurant as I was expecting an overpriced BBQ joint. Was I wrong! They delivered pickles and BBQ potato chips as appetizers. I passed on the pickles (now I regret it!) but pigged out on the delicious chips so that I was a bit full by the time our food arrived. But I didn't let that stop me. The brisket and pulled chicken were very good. We had St. Louis ribs that were meaty and tasty but just a bit too tender for me. (I like a bit of a "pull" on my ribs.) The sides were good also - potatoes and cole slaw. The slaw was not mayonnaise-based thankfully!  Had a choice of 4 sauces; they were OK. The service was outstanding. Our waiters were helpful and pleasant and our food came out very quickly! The ambiance was really nice and we just had a very enjoyable dining experience. I'll be back!
