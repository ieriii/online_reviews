this could be biased since i'm more of a savory eater than sweet... service: average. nothing terrible, nothing great wait time: terribleee please let us make reservations!! i'm sure you hate people crowding the front, WE hate being crowded in the front! it's not fun pretending to be zoo animals before we eat especially when such good smells are coming from the kitchen/ dining room! menu: not too many choices, but we did get: 1. banana choco chip pancakes- good per my dining partners 2. french toast with bananas and walnuts- to die for 3. egg thing with avocado, chorizo, veggies, queso freso- pretty good. price: not terrible, pretty standard for chicago my only recommendations: 1. more savory choices 2. let us make reservations- wait time is killer
