We showed up at 9:55 hoping just MAYBE they will let us in before they closed at 10:00. Luckily they had extended hours till 11:00. Even then they were so busy that we still had to wait 10 minutes for a table for 2. Though we were seated in a very tight corner table with little to no room to sit, the experience was delightful. The food is delicious and the service staff was charming and helpful. I've never had stuffed gnocchi before, but they were wonderful! Soft and pillowy, and yummy!! The imboltini di melenzala was a tasty twist on the classic eggplant parmigiana. Yum! BYOB and easy to find street parking.
