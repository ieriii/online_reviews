This place is awesome!!!!! We just went there last night for my boyfriend's birthday. I made a reservation on Open Table and to my surprise a variety of times were available to make a reservation. I could write a step by step, detailed review, but it is very simple what this place comes down to. The service (host, busser, waiter, manager) was EXQUISITE! The bread and butter pickles and BBQ chips that welcomed us to our table were outstanding. We ordered the bacon cheddar hush puppies ( I know, right ?! Just typing it sounds naughty) to start. And, yes, they were out of this world. My boyfriend ordered the St.Louis competition ribs with pulled pork and I ordered the flight of BBQ. I truly felt that I should have started a human tunnel for our dinner to be brought to our table because of how great the meats were prepared. We ended with the seasonal cobbler. In addition, the wine and beer list was great, not an overwhelming number of choices. However, the selected items on the beer and wine list were well thought out. I have ventured to Lillie Q, Smoke Daddy, and Honky Tonk. Don't get me wrong, those places have great BBQ as well; but Chicago Q is a step above and is the over all package.
