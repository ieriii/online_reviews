I like a big hunk of meat and Ruth's Chris has a big hunk of meat. They are deliciously broiled, melt in your mouth and cooked to perfection. And on a cold day in the middle of february there isn't anything else that can warm you up better than a medium rare NY strip, side of whipped potatoes, and a Maker's Mark Manhattan from RC. Go here for a fancy dinner, or even better, be a true old school loop Chicagoan and go for a 2hr 3 martini lunch (or in my case manhattan) There a chain for a reason, they do it right.
