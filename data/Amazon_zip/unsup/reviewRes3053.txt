Their Seoul sassy wings are applaudable! It's challenging to work out a sweet sauce recipe for chicken wings, but Crisp (or Mama Lee?) pulled it off perfectly. The sugar, the ginger, and the soy all hit the right notes, and I simply couldn't stop devouring. Oh did I mention you can get 5 full-length crispy wings for $9? Haven't tried the other wings or the bowls yet. I'm really curious now!
