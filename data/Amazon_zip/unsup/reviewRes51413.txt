Why go to Garcia's when you can go to Los Nopales two blocks away and indulge in authentic Mexican food? Like some other reviewers (and real life people), I am stymied by the success of the place - except it does cater to the heaping portions, trans-fat (read fat!) crowd. As a local resident, I am put off by the plumes of Chernobyl-like smoke that billow out of the restaurant's exhausts. Of course city inspectors are probably dining there for free.
