Brunch was yummy! I am giving Cafe 28 4 stars for their awesome brunch menu. The menu had a good mix of unique breakfast items as well as some lunchy sandwiches and things. We ordered the stuffed french toast and it came out with two BIG pieces that were really good. We also ordered the ropa vieja sandwich and it was better than I expected! The mojitos and bloody marys (spicy!) were good too- our whole bill was about 35$. The service was very good and we were seated right away.  You should check it out :)
