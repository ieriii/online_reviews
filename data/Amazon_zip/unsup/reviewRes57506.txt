Great date spot. Bit pricey but you get what you pay for. My only issue was when I made a reservation I had mentioned it was a special occasion and then was seat in the middle at a small table about 6 inches from the table next to us making the atmosphere far from romantic as it felt as we were sitting with the group next to us. I asked for a new table and was quickly and friendly accommodated and move to a booth. Great food, service and atmosphere. Fantastic wine list.
