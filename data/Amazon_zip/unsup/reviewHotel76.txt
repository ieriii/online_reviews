We picked this hotel for a weekend away from the city because we thought Oak Park would be a nice place to unwind. The lobby had an old-world charm that lent the hotel a boutique feel. We splurged on a hot tub suite, and the tub was indeed the highlight of the experience. The bathroom was huge and seems to have been recently remodeled. The rest of the suite was immaculate, the front desk staff attentive, and the wi-fi as high-speed as advertised. For those that might be directionally-challenged, this hotel is off the beaten path and a bit difficult to locate. It is within walking distance from downtown Oak Park, though, so it is very convenient for those who would prefer to leave their car and spend the weekend on foot. I think the Carleton would benefit from the services of an interior decorator for the rooms. Much of the furniture seemed very traditional mid-price hotel style and boring. Not nearly as classy as the lobby might suggest. That was a bit disappointing. We did enjoy our stay, though the hotel was not amazing enough for us to feel an urgent need to book a second stay.
