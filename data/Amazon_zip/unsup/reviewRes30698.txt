We went here after seeing it on DDD. We were really looking forward to the "Nanadict". We went on a Saturday morning. Parking was plentiful and there was no wait. The service was a little slow (I think our waitress was a newbie). We weren't in a hurry so not a big deal. We both ordered the Nanadict and split a side of cheddar & pablano grits. The poached eggs on both of our plates were overcooked and solid throughout which ruined the dish. The grits were pretty good, however. The shocker was the bill. $46.00 (tip included) for 2 breakfasts with only coffee to drink seems a little steep. Price does not usually bother me if the food us exceptional, but....
