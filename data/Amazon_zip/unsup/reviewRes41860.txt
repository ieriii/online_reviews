My husband said 3 stars, I said 4 stars- we went with 4 stars. My husband called just before I was leaving work and mentioned Ruth's Chris for dinner (this would be our first time). I made reservations from work and we arrived with a 2 minute maximum wait.  Chris was our server and he was really good. He appeared knowledgeable and was helpful for us first timers. We went with the summer classic specials being offered.  I had the house salad, 6 oz filet and shrimp, green beans with garlic and the dessert duo. I really liked the salad- the dressing seemed homemade. For $39.95 it was good. My husband had the tomato and crab soup, filet, creamed spinach, and dessert duo for $49.95. His filet was a larger size. The plates were hot which allows ones meal to stay warm, too. In fact a couple at the next table were chatting so much that their server brought them new hot plates to put their entrees on.  The nice part for me was the service. I enjoy steak but am beginning to feel steak is steak and wondering which steak place will be the one that ends my search. I would go back but believe I will continue to experiment with other Chicago steak places.
