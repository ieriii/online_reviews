I love this place and so does my wife. The food is wonderful though it is more than than the food the gives me reason to gives this 5 stars. Is their better Italian food out there maybe, this to me is Chicago Italian and that is a separate category and I can think of no better. Table side cooking and the menu items are a clear indicator. Go there to food and fun. The owners, the staff, and the bartenders are wonderful people. Whether your there with your entire family or you decided to catch a bad Bears team on the big screen in the bar you'll have fun. You may even get a high five from the owner if the Bears knock off the Vikings as they did on a recent night. Portions are beyond generous. Service is consistently good. We will often have a martini before going into the dining room. ***Warning*** This place is addictive, loved, and many comeback again and again, reservations are recommend for the busy evenings. Or plan on a drink or 2 while you wait. ***Some suggestions*** Steak Diane for 2 table side Bananas Foster for everyone. Clams Linguine w/ red sauce Veal Saltimboca Risotto Oysters Rockefeller If you don't walk out with a smile, me thinks your doing something wrong.
