Went on Mother's day weekend to find the place buzzing with Mother's Day weekenders.  Waited 15 minutes for a table for 2 at barely 10 am. Lengthy and creative menu included a special made with black bear meat - which I had to decline.  We ordered 2 of the specials, including the savory breakfast bread pudding (chorizo, bacon, veggies, and cheese baked in) at the waitresses' suggestion which was great; and the black truffle omelet which was equally savory, ginormous in size, and delish.  Staff was friendly and helpful but gave every notion they needed the table as soon as we finished - understandable given the wait line, but we felt a bit hurried in and out.  Would come back to this bright and sunny cafe, especially fitting for family or more formal brunches.
