This is my first Yelp review so please bear with me. I met up with a girlfriend at Mercat a la Planxa after finding out she was in town on short notice and it was right by her hotel. I am so glad we went! First, we didn't have a reservation and they were gracious enough to seat us on the patio. It started to rain and we were sat right away inside.  We had a wonderful waiter who was very patient since we had never been before and were trying to catch up after 4 years of not seeing each other. We ordered a bottle of wine and then the fun began. They started us off with this very tasty tomato bread. Yum! We just ordered a few dishes to share. First was some grilled prawns. YUM! They were simply made and very good! We had the ESPINACAS A LA CATALANA which was this wonderful spinach with apples and nuts and raisins. It was my girlfriend's favorite thing! we had the TRUITA DE PATATA because I cannot resist a Spanish omelet at a tapas place. It was good but very small. And we had the Mar i Muntanya i, which was this amazing veal sausage. It came with some potatos and some octopus that I really didn't care for but the sausage was delicious. Now dessert?? OMG! We got these little banana chocolate croquette things with caramel, toasted marshmallow and some rosemary infused olive oil. I though it sounded weird, but they were sooooo good. I would go back just for those! If you go, you've got to try them The waiter recomend we get 3 to 4 dishes per person to share but that was enough for us. I would say that had I taken my boyfriend, more dishes would have been ordered. I really liked it and would definitely go back. Next time I will try the chef's tasting menu and still order my desert!
