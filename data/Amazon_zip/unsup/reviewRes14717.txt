Overall, I was very pleased with my experience here. Upon arrival, the hostess told us the wait would be 25-60 minutes. It's a longer range that I'm used to hearing, but we'd already passed up another restaurant and wanted to try this place, so put our names down. Within two minutes, the cocktail waitress was taking our drink order and making interesting conversation with us - she was incredibly helpful and cheerful! We were probably seated within 20 minutes, and for longer waits there's a nice area to sit or stand with your dinner partners and socialize. (I really loved the decor actually - cohesive theme, interesting little touches around, nothing too overwhelming.) The food was good. It definitely wasn't great - what we had at least. We had the classic bruschetta, which was really rather bland (would not order it again), and the duck confit bruschetta, which was far too salty. For our entree, we split a pizza (definitely enough for two, with a small appetizer and beer - could even skip the appetizer I think). It was cooked really well - thin, crispy crust with great toppings, but again, kind of bland. There was just no real kick to anything, no "oh my god, yum" moment at dinner. Will definitely be back to try more beers and food, though. Great neighborhood place, absolutely.
