Maybe I'm not an avid fan of thai food, but I didn't really enjoy the food that much... Out of the appetizers,the crab rangoons were pretty good. Portions are not that big, so I have NO idea what people are talking about when they say that. As soon as my friend's pad thai came, my other friend asked him if he got the lunch portion =/ Service was pretty good, our waiter was very patient (he had to come back 3 times because I just could not decide what I wanted in life).
