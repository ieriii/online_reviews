I gave this hotel 3 stars because once you get over the impressive size and plethora of shops it really is just average. The rooms are clean and modestly appointed but adequate. The water pressure left plenty to be desired though, along with the air conditioning. I stayed in the east wing, its my understanding the west wing is newer and perhaps a bit better. I stayed 5 days due to a conference for work and overall its livable but definitely not a 5 star hotel. The one major thing it has going for it is location. It is in the heart of it all. Close to downtown and navy pier.
