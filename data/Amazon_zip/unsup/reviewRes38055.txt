This is clearly the best bar in Chicago, from an objective "I don't know the bar tenders and I'm not a local" point of view. The beer selection, in bottles and on tap, is beyond phenomenal - probably the best I've ever seen. (Especially their choice in beers. They may have fewer taps than a few places in Chicago ( a very few) but all of them are serious quality.) The food is also very worthy of the beer - the lamb was great, as was the steak-frittes. The Hopleaf makes other gastropubs look like sports bars, and that's a good thing.
