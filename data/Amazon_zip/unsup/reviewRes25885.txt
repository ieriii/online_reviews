Growing up as one of 5 children, my parents taught us never to waste food. Anything that was burnt was to be eaten anyway. Probably because it was your fault you didn't pay attention to it. To this day, I love a good piece of burnt toast. I love burnt cheese even more Pequod's, thank you for drawing inspiration from my messed up childhood. This is one of the best deep-dish pizzas in Chicago. Actually, in the Deep Dish Pizza Tasting I did with my friends, Pequod's won. The carmelized crust is so delicious it should be criminal. Crispy crust with burnt cheese. Oh, man... It makes my mouth water just thinking about it. You MUST order the sausage pizza. I'm not usually a sausage kind of gal (The kind made from pork! Get your minds out of the gutter!), but Pequod's has converted me with their pepper-y, flavorful, the-other-white-meat goodness. We also ordered a pepperoni and green pepper pizza (a.k.a. the best pizza topping combination of all time). It was the perfect meat-to-veggie ratio, and the peppers me feel like I was being healthy despite the 1,000,000 grams of carbs I inhaled without a second thought. 2 pieces will be plenty per person, but leftovers are encouraged because you will not be able to stop thinking about it by lunch the next day and will want more. Take this psychological fatty's word for it.
