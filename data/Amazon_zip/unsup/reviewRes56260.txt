Wonderful cozy BYOB (!!) with flavorful, reasonably priced food (decent sized entrees around $10-14) and the BEST waitstaff/owners EVER.  Seriously these people are genuinely warm and way too cute. There was a group of 7 of us and I can't really remember what everyone got, though my friend's order of Simply It Beef was melt-in-your-mouth good! (will def get that next time I go). The best part was they made these delicious fried banana desserts for us (3 plates of 3 bananas each with chocolate sauce and whipped cream) on the house! Thats right, free dessert!The place is well-light and nicely decorated, and the bathrooms were really clean. Overall fun atmosphere for a group or a nice place for a date too.They've got a bunch of good deals going on these days (i.e. prix fixe deals for multiple sized parties of people) so check them out.That's why I chose it for my first review on Yelp. Love it!
