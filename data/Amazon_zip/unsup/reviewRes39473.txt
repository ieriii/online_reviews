4.5 stars on my scale This was my third visit to L&E. My first two visits I came too late for the food service and had to settle for cocktails. This bar has a huge selection of beers. The cocktails are just okay. I had the Full House and wasnt very happy with the rubbing alcohol taste. Supposedly it was the lightest drink on the menu...granted I'm not a big drinker, but I think I would have ended up on the floor if I finished that drink. Maybe that's why they have rooms you can rent out...  Anyways, finally got a chance to taste what L&E is all about. Sadly, I'm a sucker for hype and L&E was able to live up to it. I had the pork shoulder over soft potatoes dressed with a small green salad and small bacon tidbits on top. The dish had the right amount of seasoning and salt from the bacon. I liked the nicely charred pork.  For dessert I had the donuts with shredded parmesan and goat cheese gelato. Doughy goodness! After glancing over the latest reviews, the three times I've been there I've had good service. Note, the Full House drink I disliked was happily replaced by the bartender.
