Tapas!!!!! Great location!! We had the roasted bone marrow recommended by a friend. It is delicious! Taste and melts in your mouth like butter. We also had the artichokes and stuffed olives!!! I love the wood decor and wine sayings. It's an intimate place, but ate here with my best friend and we were seated between two couples- not awkward at all! Chicagoans are very friendly!!!
