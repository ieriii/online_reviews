I wanted so much to give this 5 stars, but 4 stars it is. I made a reservation here on Thursday night through Village Vines: 30% off our entire bill (food and drinks) so I thought this would be a great opportunity to try Dale's restaurant. After reading the yelp reviews I was really excited to go. If you can find the entrance without passing it up than good for you but there is a huge covering over the outside. They are doing some construction and it's kind of hard to find the entrance but hopefully this will be fixed soon. Upon entering there was only one table seated. It started to fill up as the night went on, but there were still no more than 4 tables filled. I liked how everyone working there was a team. We had one server but the bar tender and other people would come over and fill our water glasses or clear our dishes. I'm not sure if it's always like that but it was cool. Our server was ok. She didn't really explain things very well or go into much detail about the dishes. Every encounter was kind of awkward. Also, since the tables are super close together, her butt was in our face as she was talking to the other table beside us. I know this can't be helped but the set up of the tables needs some work. Hopefully with the new addition in the front, things will be more spread out. I highly recommend doing the wine pairings. They are excellent and compliment the dishes beautifully. The food was really good. Amazing yet different combinations. I had the cod, short ribs and lemon. My husband had the egg, pork and corn. Order something you wouldn't normally like and you'll be pleasantly surprised. LOVE that the food and drinks are all organic and most are local. P.S. Dale came out of the kitchen a few times during our meal so we got to peek at him. Yay! But he didn't visit any of the tables :(
