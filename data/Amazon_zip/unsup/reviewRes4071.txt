What M.C. is doing at Schwa with his crew of 5 is comparable to Alinea. That is a fact. You will not find a better value for fine dining anywhere in the city. Schwa, in my experience was as close to a perfect dining experience as you can get. Very fun atmosphere, delicious food, helpful and interesting service... The best time to make a rez is weekdays between 12-2.
