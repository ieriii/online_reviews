This vietnamese restaurant has an almost generic name for a VERY authentic and delicious meal. This was my first experience with this cuisine, but I had the pleasure of being guided by a close friend who was extremely happy as well. They were a little understaffed, so the service was a little slow, but they worked very hard to accomodate the customers. We started with the Bon Vivant plate of four different egg rolls and spring rolls... all absolutely DELICIOUS. The chicken clay pot was very good, as was the pumpkin shrimp dish, and the bamboo duck was very good too with a slightly sweet sauce - awesome, our favorite dish. Every dish we saw coming out of the kitchen looked absolutely amazing and smelled outstanding. This was a cozy restaurant with a slightly romantic ambience - we never would have known it based on the name itself! Highly recommend to anyone looking for delicious food at a very reasonable price. And it is BYOB!
