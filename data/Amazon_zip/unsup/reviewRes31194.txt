You can't really ask for much more out of a restaurant in this price range. The food is creative and uses some of the freshest ingredients I've seen in the city. In Italy I was always amazed at how good a simple salad could taste, based just on the freshness of the ingredients...and nana's comes close to duplicating that. The shrimp and oyster po boy is my favorite, but really you can't go wrong with anything on the menu. its crowded, and with good reason, so expect a wait, but the food will be worth it.
