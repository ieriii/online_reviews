I agree with Mike g. It was ok. The place itself is very cute and the wait staff was great. We did enjoy the new potoes appetizer and would have loved more (there were 4)! The "large" pasta dishes were so small! I had the paesanelle pasta and it lacked flavor. My friends had the salmon and seemed to be ok.
