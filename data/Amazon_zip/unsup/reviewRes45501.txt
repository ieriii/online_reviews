Wilde is great for lunch or dinner. The food I've tried is mostly very good. The interior design is great - make sure you check out the bathroom even if you don't have to go. One complaint - and it is a big one - is on the nights that they have a DJ (usually very good dj's) the music is SOOOO loud that you can't hear the person you're having dinner with. Its awful and annoying. For that, I would normally knock off two stars, but since they have a cool outdoor seating w/ greenery, I will knock off one.
