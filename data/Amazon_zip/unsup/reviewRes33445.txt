Went here for round two of boyfriend's birthday recently. Arrived on a Monday at about 6:45 and was so glad that our table had been reserved because this place was packed! Interesting set up with large windows on the left and a fairly rectangular room that darkens as it stretches towards kitchen in back. Beautiful mahogany bar frames the front of room and would be great for people watching or waiting for a table. We were seated along the bench style row to the right and even though we had a fairly large group, we were able to carve out a small corner of the restaurant, which was nice.  Restaurant has a rotating menu so specifics change weekly. We enjoyed some calamari and bruchetta (with and without the pancetta) to start, both of which were nice and fresh. For main course I had a light broccoli rigatoni dish with a simple olive oil sauce that was a little heavy on the garlic. And trust me I loves me some garlic. Lets just say that if you are here on a first date, go for the red sauce. Boyfriend had a goat cheese and tomato pasta dish that really didn't wow either of us. But could just have been our choices as we heard good things from the table about the butternut ravioli (seasonal), frutti di mare and chicken diavolo.  We did both note that the pasta was perfectly al dente. For the birthday they brought out a simple dessert (chocolate sauce smothering something small) with a candle, which was nice. Service was fine. Overall a great spot for a larger family dinner. The bench style seating and extensive wine list lends to a bustling atmosphere which may exceed a decent decibel for more intimate dining.
