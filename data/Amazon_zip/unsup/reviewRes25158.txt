This is my usual grab a cup of coffee and pastry joint. If you like getting caffeined up, come on over because it's free refills. Espresso tart or bougatsa (phyllo dough filled with cream custard with a slight lemon taste and topped with honey) to couple the black cup of goodness just makes the ambiance of the European cafe joint pop out. The food is decent, but I come here to chat it up with my buddies over coffee and pastries to the late hours.
