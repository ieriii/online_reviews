I've been a here a few times, and after the last trip, I have no intentions of ever returning. A few things to know: Cash only. Service will always be slow, though the servers are usually fun. No reservations in advance. Seating: When we arrived, we had a friend that gets cold easily, so we asked to be seated indoors. When they called us after an hour of waiting, we were being led to an outdoor table, anyway. Thanks? We took our losses & sat down... only to see a large table inside (well, in the tented, heated area anyway) that was empty and was being reserved for a group..despite the "no reservations" policy. Awesome. Service: The service was slow, as usual, but usually the waitstaff is pretty cool. The waitress we had was a complete mess and rude. I understand, it's busy and can be hectic for you, but there's no excuse to be rude to a table that doesn't give you attitude. We got chips, but no salsa. We got the Chijifrito (amazingly delicious, btw) but no individual plates to start eating. We got our main course, but no utensils to eat. And when we requested carryout boxes, the waitress came back, scowled, then smacked my friend with the box to get her attention. Food: A friend of mine disliked the burrito, the Chicharron tastes amazing but is heavy and can probably give you a heart attack on the spot, and the Pepito was said to be pretty good. Cost: Our bill showed we were overcharged on items where we did not order extras. We were tired of sitting in the cold, so we tossed our cash on the table and booked it out of there. TL;DR (Too long, didn't read) : If I want deep fried heart attack on a plate, I'd rather go somewhere where they don't smack us with boxes, accept credit, and don't overcharge us. The food is great, but get carryout or something.
