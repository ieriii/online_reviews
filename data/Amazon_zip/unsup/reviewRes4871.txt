The first thing you have to do is control yourself. CONTOL! DO NOT EAT EVERYTHING BECAUSE YOU CANNOT FIT IT IN YOUR STOMACH! Once you have that mantra down make sure you come at a convenient time. I recommend anything after 10 PM because you will be rubbing against strangers and be up to your elbows in asses. You might question my understanding of anatomy but you'll understand once you get there. Their menu doesn't change too much; Asparagus & Hazelnuts with Arugula & Treviso - Light and flavorful. The arugula adds a good mix with the sweet hazelnuts that just evens it out! Damn good! Chorizo Stuffed Olives - Great! It's a staple and again they do a great job mixing up the flavors so it's not too sweet. Pig's Ear with Crispy Kale, Pickled Cherry Peppers & Fried Egg - If I have one complaint, it was over too soon. The portion is good but I just wish I could have had more. The egg isn't too runny and mixes with the pig's ear. Kale is lightly salted and tastes freaking awesome. Going to be honest and say I'm not a huge fan of vinegar so I could have cared less for the peppers but they were weren't as sour as I would have imagined. Wagyu Sirloin Tip with Fingerling Potatoes Red Onions, Olive & Bone Marrow Vinaigrette - They wagyu wasn't anything special and the combination of fingerling potatoes and red onions made it more of a western "meat n potatoes" kind of dish but it was good. Wouldn't say it's something you'd have to get. BONE MARROW!!!!!!!!!!!!! SCOOP OUT MARROW, SPREAD ON BREAD, CRUSH SALT POUR OVER MARROW, SHOVE IN MOUTH. DROOL. Word of advice; don't be shy and sparing with your marrow. SLATHER THAT S***. Desert has always been the Panino con Nutella for me. - It's like a fancy shmancy s'more that has the perfect texture and consistency. Crispy on the outside, gooey in the middle, light because of the bread, heavy hazelnut chocolate sauce and creamy marshmallows to boot. I NEVER think I have room for it... but I always end up finishing it.
