Disclaimer: I am a big gringa. My spanish isn't too bad, but I basically have only had their burritos and horchata. I promise to go to yelper Mandi G's recommended spot soon (Traspasada- a few blocks south of here), but in the meantime, here's my opinion.... There are three of these places, all called La Pasadita. This is one of the two on the west side of Ashland, the one that is more south. 1132 N. Ashland. My husband says the one that is more north on the west side does not have guac at all, which of course would be a deal breaker for us.  We like the steak burritos. Get the "super burrito" for $7.50 and have left overs because it comes with nice extras like beans, guac, rice, tomatoe etc. inside. The regular burrito for me is gross because it's a huge portion of only meat and cilantro. For some that would be heaven, but I need a variety of flavors. We found the asada/steak to be a nice quality and tasty.  We get to go, though they do have seating. We do not expect great ambiance. It's busy/popular, so you have to wait a few minutes for your food. We will be back, and I'll also try Mandi G's suggestion. I love yelp!
