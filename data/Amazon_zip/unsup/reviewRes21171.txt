Mayan Palace claims to have "the best margaritas in the world"... While that seems a little far-fetched, I must admit they are pretty good. In fact, their most expensive margarita is made with top-shelf tequila, costs only $9 and comes in a giant glass... now that's what I like. Expect to be hammered after about two of those. Now about the food, it's pretty good but not outstanding. I ordered the pork tamales, and they were pretty tasty. My boyfriend got the grilled shrimp, also tasty. So no complaints, but it's not the best Mexican I've had (still better than most places in NYC, but that's not saying much). I have to mention however that the service was extremely friendly... almost so friendly that it was kind of weird. Seriously, we had three waiters taking care of us, and each of them would come by every few minutes to check on us. I'm not complaining... just noting. I'd probably go back if in the neighborhood and craving Mexican, but I probably wouldn't go too much out of my way. 3-1/2 stars.
