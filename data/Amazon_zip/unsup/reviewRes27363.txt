I have a serious closet addiction.....it's called I'm in love with Nuevo Leon. I have literally tried over 30 other mexican restaurants in the Chicago area trying to find something just as good.....I got nothin... Everything is excellent on the menu but my favorite happens to be the enchiladas suizas. The chips and salsa are insanely good. I've NEVER had better, anywhere..... and I travel all over the U.S.for work.  This is my absolute favorite mexican restaurant in Chicago!
