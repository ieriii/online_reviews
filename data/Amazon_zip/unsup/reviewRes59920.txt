Alliance Bakery is great. I haven't got to try a huge selection of all the treats yet. The cupcakes are tasty and cute, which in my opinion makes them taste better. And I've had their chocolate rasberry cake. wow. I always get iced coffee when I go there. I'm not sure what they brew but it's delicous.Then I sit next door and take part in the free wireless. Everyone who works there is so nice.
