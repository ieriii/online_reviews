I popped my proverbial sushi cherry here thanks to the lovely Jackie P. I posed around town as a sushi connoisseur as I ate only California rolls. I was informed that it wasn't really sushi I was eating so I had to go and get the full experience. So I did at Wakamono and loved the Rainbow roll and some of the other items I got to try. I'm not posing any longer but I do have more to try! The place seems nice as I did like the layout. I also like that it is BYOB, even with the $5 cork fee ... If I were a lush then perhaps I would have a problem with that. It is a work in progress on being a lush - I'm sure a few more Yelp gatherings and I'll be there! So I was part of a small party so I didn't pay attention too much on the prices but they seem fair enough with the amount of sushi pieces that came out. It was a good group to be with and everyone seem pleased with their food. The service was very good too as they were quick and attentive.
