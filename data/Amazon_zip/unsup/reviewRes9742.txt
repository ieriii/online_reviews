WOW! Went here last night for my birthday and was blown away by the entire experience. From the friendly service to the amazing food to the decor and atmosphere, this was one of the best dining experiences I have had in a long time. I was greeted immediately upon entering the door and when I sat at the bar to wait for my friend to park the car, I was treated to a complimentary glass of champagne as an apology for the construction out front. Once my friend arrived, we were seated immediately and greeted by Barry, our waiter who was top notch. Barry was very knowledgeable and helpful, suggesting a perfect wine that complemented what both of us were ordering. Everything was absolutely delicious, but I would be remiss if I didn't single out the foie gras. It was whipped and spread over warm zucchini bread in a way that tasted as if I were having dessert instead of an appetizer. Amazing. The frog legs were excellent as well, and I loved the inclusion of escargot in the dish - perfect combination of flavors. I chose the pork for my entree and it was fantastic. Cooked to perfection and served with a delicious puree, it melted in your mouth. For dessert, we ordered the beet and the corn dishes. I love beets and liked this dessert but it was not my all-time fave. The corn dessert was absolutely delicious and I ended up eating more of that than my beloved beets. All of this would have been more than enough to merit a 5 star rating, but the added touches of the tastes in between courses, the chef coming out to check on his guests, the fabulous service from Barry and the overall ambiance of the restaurant made this place outstanding. We will definitely be back and will put this at the top of our all-time favorite lists!
