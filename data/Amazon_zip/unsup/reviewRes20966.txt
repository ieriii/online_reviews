I tried I really tried to get into Xoco tonight! it's on the "Rick Bayless" block at Clark and Illinois. http://www.rickbayless.c I was in line when a dentally impaired (sorry I am just disappointed) curly haired female told me they were turning people away because it would take x amt of time to serve x # of customers. she said they weren't sure yet but they close between 9 and 10 pm. wow I think I peed my pants and cried I was longing for that good clean bayless street food. no I didn't pee or cry I went somewhere else but I'll be back in tha morning!
