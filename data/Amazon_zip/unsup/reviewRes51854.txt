Let me just say OMG, the pizza here is like no other place. It is so cheesy and the dough is bliss. All pizza should be like this. I grow up in Chicago and this is what I knew and now I am sadden to say LA has nothing like it. It takes effort to eat it more then one slice but you have too, especially me since I live in LA now. I go back and force myself to eat two, because it is Cheer Bliss. The BEST, nothing compares and I love Pizza. Please come to LA. I wish LA had this place :(
