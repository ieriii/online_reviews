Okay, I'll give them a five.  If you go, see if you can be seated in the round room overlooking the street. In addition to the food, and drinks, you can people watch on Michigan...very awesome. She loves the spare ribs...totally loves them with the mash potatoes. I... try different things and I have never been disappointed. The drinks are good (check the drink menu) and the food is good, the service is good. They do Chicago proud.
