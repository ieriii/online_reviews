Went on New Years to buy steaks and fish. Neither item had been put out in the display case by 10am. I mentioned something to a manager about it and came back at 11am... the butchers still hadn't displayed any meat or seafood. Great product, but I BUY WITH MY EYES and feel that seeing the food is a critical part of the Fox and Obel experience.
