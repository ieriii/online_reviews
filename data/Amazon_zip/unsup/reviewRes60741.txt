A few times I went I was stuck on the appetizer Full Metal jacket because it was so awesome! I recently had a burger with chicken and tuna on it. Forgot what its called But it was so good!!. The burger was HUGE. You can also replace the beef part with turkey chicken or a veggie burger which is what I did. All the people there are really nice. The bartenders are also creative, The only thing keeping them one star off is the price. Its kind of on the expensive side.
