Just went to a catered event and found out Irazu was the behind the scenes caterer. Amazing! All foods that were supposed to be crunchy were crunchy, meat was tender not tough. The flavors were just like I remembered from my Costa Rican get-away last Spring. If you're looking for a somewhat healthy & unique option to the pasta / American type cuisine for your holiday bash, I would highly recommend Irazu!
