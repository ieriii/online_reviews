One of the biggest let downs of '07. Everyone I know raves about this place so I had to try it. Not only was the pizza HORRIBLE (which is honestly one of the hardest things to make horrible), the service was unreasonably bad. The server messed up our order, I mean how can you mess up a pepperoni pizza. I will never go back there to get pizza. The rest of the place seemed cool. I may go back to have a drink or watch a game, But with the mix of sickly looking vegan hipsters and overly groomed yuppies I thought the world was going to explode.
