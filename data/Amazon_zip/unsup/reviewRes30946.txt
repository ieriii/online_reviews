So I'm not vegan or vegetarian, but I genuinely enjoy this place. It's delicious! I hadn't been here in a really long while, so the wife and I decided to stop in the other day. Thankfully, they've changed their portion sizes to more manageable ones, as I absolutely hate taking leftovers home.  They have a fantastic menu all around, but my favorite is still the Reuban sandwich. Oh! Oh! Their deserts and milkshakes are really good too!
