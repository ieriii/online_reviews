I likey! I can't believe I have lived in Uptown for so long and have not known about Demera till last month. All this time - wasted! *sigh* No worries, I will have to make up for it. Demera has a great selection of starters but the combo meals are jus totally worth every cent you pay for it. It works out to be like $15 for a combo of 4 entree options served on the sour bread (injera) - usually enough for 2 people. Friendly wait staff and some good Ethiopian wines. I highly recommend this place for the adventurous who live to try out new cuisines. Jus off the red line too. Did I mention the lunch buffet on weekdays?!!
