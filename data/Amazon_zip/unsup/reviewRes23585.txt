I am generally a fan of Icosium. I have had many great experiences, and find myself still thinking about what happened the other night, or if it really happened. I order the same thing every time I go to Icosium. Either location. Although I'm traditionally pretty adventurous, I end up going to Icosium when I don't know where to go, and it's familiar. Needlesstosay, my friend and I arrived. She ordered a crepe. I ordered my salad. My cafe au lait. The drink never arrived. No biggie. The water with the mint is great. I'm sorry waitress. I didn't order a crepe. No, I really didn't. No, I'm really sorry to be a pain, but I actually have a medical condition so I am positive I didn't give you the wrong order. My friends crepe was wrong as well. The waitress removes them. It was clear when they returned that they had dumped out the crepes, and put them into a salad bowl. But....my friend never ordered a crepe. I ordered a salad, like I just told you. Where is the confusion coming from? The place isn't busy, and I'm not being an asshole. I'm just hungry. At this point the chef comes up, throws two salads at us, and accused us of trying to steal two meals from him and that he expected us to buy both ( we hadn't even eaten from the first round). Why are we getting yelled at by an angry chef? I'm scared, I thought. I looked down and told my friend to stay quiet. She was less than thrilled. No one wants to spend money at a place they are going to get yelled at, get terrible service, and not be provided with what we ordered. It doesn't make sense. It was apparent the poor waitress was receiving the worst part of it, as she came over whispering I'm sorry over and over. To the Poor Waitress -- We hope you got to keep the $10 we threw down before leaving, although we don't it. I will help you find a new job if it kills me. Your chef is a dick. You deserve better.
