I love this place, the food is so good, they have a nice selection of beers and it's a very comfortable place to grab a bite. The Pasta Bowl is a restaurant, but connected to it via a few doorways it the bar The Otherside. You can eat on either one, but if you want a low key meal and nice conversation stick to the Pasta Bowl side. I've never had something I didn't like and I've never brought anyone there who went away unhappy. Some of my favorites are Conchigle Gorgonzola, Clams Cappellini, Cappellini Pomodoro and the Macaroni al Fromaggi. They do dine in, carryout and delivery serve dinner pretty late. For a yummy meal that will curb your carb cravings go to the Pasta Bowl you won't regret it!
