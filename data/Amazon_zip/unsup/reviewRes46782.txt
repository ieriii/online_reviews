Uncommon Ground is one of my favorite neighborhood places to go and have a drink after work, and enjoy a nice dinner with friends and family. (We love honkey-tonk Fridays!!!) I love their beer and wine selection, and I also love the fact that they support IL farmers and use the freshest produce and meats from our own state. Their menu changes seasonally, and has great options for all price ranges. My only complaint which is why I am not giving them is a five, is that recently over the past year their service hasn't been the best. They either seem short on staff or they are so busy it's hard to keep up with new customers being seated. Not sure what's going on there, but the last seven times I've been there, we haven't had the greatest service at high peak hours. Overall, Uncommon Ground is a great place to hang out with friends after a long day's work, or to share a nice meal with your family. Thanks for bringing a great sustainable restaurant to our neighborhood and STAYING here! :)
