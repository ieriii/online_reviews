Nana's was a unique experience. Since I live so close I have been there a grand total of three times but each time I ordered different things. My first time I ordered an egg benedict which was simplistic yet delicious. I would say the prices are a bit steep but for the overall experience I am willing to pay for. What i suggest ordered (if they havent already run out) is the apple cider (if its in season) it is absolutely delicious! The sweet potato fries are okay. I don't really remember what else I ordered since it was a while ago. The waiters were okay they weren't that bad but they werent as friendly. I like it but not so much that I would say let's go there for lunch on a whim.
