I hardly ever eat wings, and even though Crisp was good enough to make me reconsider, every other wing place would just pale in comparison. So, I think I'll be coming to Crisp for all of my wing needs. I had an amazing Seoul steak bowl, then shared HUGE wings with a friend, and we both could not have been happier.  The best part? I'll be moving much closer to this neighborhood in a few weeks and will be returning regularly! Yay!
