I was hesitant about coming back to rick bayless's restaurants especially when i was disappointed during the restaurant week menu. My friend wanted to go there and try a dish that was on the bets thing I ever ate website / show that he follows and he was able to get reservations for lunch so I decided to give the Chef another chance. So I asked the waiter what are the 3 best items on this menu that he loves and of the 3 he named we were eating 2 of the 3 he suggested.  I ordered the Puerco Oaxaqueno which was a Grill-roasted Gunthorp pork loin, smoky black bean "enchilada" (homemade chorizo, queso anejo mashed potatoes), limey grilled knob onions & guero chiles, cilantro. This dish looked very similar to the dish I had back at restaurant week. This time it was on the dot! The flavor was really hit the spot and each bite was juicy. The mash potatoes was also amazing. At first I wasn't sure what it was until I asked the waiter and I thought that was a great idea to put the mash potatoes inside some tortilla. All the bold flavors came together for me and I was extremely satisfied. I also tried the rib eye dish my buddy ordered and that was really good too. I would say Rickbayless is back on my good side
