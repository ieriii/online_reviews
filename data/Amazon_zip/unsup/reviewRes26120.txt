It's probably the perfect place for a first date, even though I would not go on a weekend night! Food is very good, I went there last night with my boyfriend and another couple and I would probably go back in the future. I liked it a lot. The cheese fondue was not my favourite and I could have used more beef for my entree (I got the aged beef tenderloin). They have a good selection of wine (I ordered Moscato D'Asti, I don't usually find it very easily) and cooking your own food gives you a lot of time to chit chat with your friends. It was a good experience and fortunately it was not crowded...I don't want to know how that little place gets on a saturday night!!!
