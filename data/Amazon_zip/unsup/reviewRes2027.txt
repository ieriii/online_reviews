What can I say about this place that hasn't already been said? I learned about Hot Doug's when I went to a cross-promotion event at the Map Room in Wicker Park, where Hot Doug's brought sausage samples to complement samples of Unibroue, a microbrew from Quebec. The evening was terrific -- I was getting smoothly plastered from tiny samples of 10% alc. beer, but somehow, my taste buds and their connections to my brain stayed sensitive enough to realize how friggin' awesome the sausage was! I went back with some friends a week later, where we mixed and matched what we liked best from the night in Wicker Park with new sausages we wanted to try. The restaurant itself is clean and kitschy, and the line (during the weekends at least, the only time I go) usually extends outside and back 50 feet. Also, the place seems to be open about five hours a week (and he's closing for two weeks to observe President's day [what?]), so while I don't have the opportunity to visit frequently, my sensory memory guides me back from time to time. This guy really has it figured out -- serve a quality product for a reasonable price, let the people flock to you from word of mouth, have the store open for minutes a week, and you've got a great gig. Try: The Thuringer, definitely (what a friend famously referred to as his "go-to sausage") the bratwurst and the duck fat fries.
