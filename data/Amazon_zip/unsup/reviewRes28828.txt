I went a while back to celebrate a friend's birthday. Great food and great drinks (yummy margaritas), but I'll pass on describing all that. All I have to say is that Rick Bayless came out and we actually chatted with him for a bit at our table. I was speechless and starstruck. I felt like a teenager gushing over her pop idol, as I told Rick Bayless that I watched his show like it's a religion and love all his recipes. I even made him sign a scrap piece of paper - I should've bought his book and had him sign that, but I was just so in awe.
