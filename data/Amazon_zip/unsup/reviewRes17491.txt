Carnivale is awesome! Fantastic, flavorful food and drinks and a very unique atmosphere. My only complaint about this place is the hostess staff - more than once they have been rude and arrogant. The last time I called to make reservations for lunch, the hostess acted like she didn't know what a reservation was. However, the wait staff is friendly and very knowledgeable about the menu. This is a great place to bring out-of-towners and is always a crowd pleaser. It can get a bit pricey, but it's also a place where you can order a bunch of stuff from the menu and try a little of everything. The wine list is comprehensive and has a lot of non-American options, and has a wide price range. My favorites here are the mojitos, the ropa vieja, and the Rum-glazed pork shoulder with fried plantains and Puerto Rican rice and beans...this dish is completely craveable.
