STOP READING. Ok that probably didn't work. But there are three things, and three things only you need to know about this place. Read too many yelp reviews, and you've undermined everything magical and lovely about this place. The more surprises the better; the surprises will all be pleasant, believe me. 1) There's no sign, look for a dapper man pointing painted on the wall and open the door he's pointing at 2) Don't go on a weekend, and don't go too late in the evening; the place feels better when it feels like it's all yours 3) Play the part; dress classy and feel classy. why are you still reading?
