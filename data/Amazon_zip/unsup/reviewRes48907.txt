my review is a little late as i went over the summer but i don't think their menu has changed much since the dishes we selected were kind of "signature" dishes.  the sweetbreads, i recall, was like eating seared fat. nothing bad about this, i love fat. better when it's seared and hot. the pork rinds were fun, but there is something wrong with paying more than 99 cents for a cone of pork rinds, don't you think? the pork belly we ordered was very good. it seems like the dish nowadays. the grits were sweet and salty and came with garlic bits and more pork fat. the charcuterie plate that was suggested in the nyt review was ok. it's not really my thing. my hubby enjoyed it though. it had the standard head cheese, sausage and pate. also, there was a slab of cold pork pie.  The potee that was also raved about in the nyt review was unmemorable. the last thing we ordered was the little gem salad which had shaved cheese and pork ears had very little taste. overall, decent food, if not pricey. the ambience was fun. the area reminded me much of nyc meatpacking district and in a part of chicago, i rarely go to. lots of people watching.
