I am not a pizza fan at all but this place changed how I thought about pizza. I've been to many pizza places and had all sorts of pizza from "high-end" and fast-food type and I gotta say this place is the best! So I use to think that all pizzas tasted similar, but I'm wrong. Here they do deep dish (which you can basically get anywhere these days) but they use CORN MEAL as their pizza dough. This makes the taste sooooo much better and on top of it, the pizza does not taste so greasy. The toppings were the same as everywhere else and the sauce was slightly better than your average pizza place but the pizza dough made the biggest difference in the world! So if you go to Chicago, go to Gino's East and this will make your trip worth it. P.S. Does anyone know of any places that sells deep dish "corn meal" dough pizza anywhere in San Francisco or NYC? or is this just a Chicago thing?
