I am sooooo happy I found this place. I'm a pasta snob, no joke, and I must say what you can get at this place for $10 and under is unbelievable. Most Italian restaurants in the city are over priced and can't hold a candle to Windsor's little Italy, but this one is not only affordable, but DELICIOUS. Frutti di mare for $10 with fresh seafood and fra diablo sauce upon request?! I thought I was dreaming, it was that good. This place is a real pasta bar, you can sit and watch the chefs at work juggling five pans at once, I haven't seen an operation like this since Aspen, Colorado in '92. Via la Pasta Bowl!
