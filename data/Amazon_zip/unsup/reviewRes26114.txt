Rumor has it that Pequod himself/herself/itself placed a large deep dish with pepperonis in front of a pre-hibernation Grizzly. The Grizzly ate three slices, stared at the rest for 10 minutes, then slunk away in shame and died of carbohydrate poisoning. The rumor is true, for what Pequod's offers is an unparalleled deep dish gut bomb of death experience. The motto here: One slice is a meal, two a mistake, three a nightmare. And while the pizza is good enough to rocket Pequod himself/herself/itself to Chicago pizza infamy, the restaurant has chosen to forgo commercialized tackiness in favor of the modest and timeless feel of a 1980s family restaurant. The kind of place where you'd eat a nice pie before losing your virginity in high school or watching Ronald Reagan get shot or whatever they did.
