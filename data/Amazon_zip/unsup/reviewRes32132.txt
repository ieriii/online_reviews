MY CHEATING HEART... I strayed. I'm so ashamed. Ethiopian Diamond has always been my one true love for Ethiopian food. It was the place that made me fall in love with the cuisine and my very first Yelp review. Yet as a Yelper, my instincts are to roam and after learning that I get triple United miles at Demera, my will power vanished. First impression: They tried to seat my party of three on a table suitable for two, with the third person sitting in the middle of a busy walkway. Uh uh. Not happening. We asked for to be seated at a table for four, and they begrudgingly complied. So for, not so good. Second Impression: Broken glass and soaked with beer. I must have showed up on amateur night because there were two separate incidents of plates and glasses crashing to the floor, the latter causing my coat to get soaked in beer. Not looking good Demera... Final Impression: The food. The food and service were actually quite good. They offer bigger portions than Ethiopian Diamond and their kitfo and doro wat are spicier. They were also very proactive about bringing out more injera when we started to run low.  All in all, I have to give credit where credit is due; their food is excellent. Give then choice though, my heart still belongs to Ethiopian Diamond (if they'll take me back).
