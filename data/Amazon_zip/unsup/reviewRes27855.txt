Really really good restaurant. The popcorn was good and i don't like popcorn. We got some free wine with a very cool explanation of what it was (that I've since forgotten). The food was all excellent we did a land and a sea and a hot and a cold. Dessert was excellent, pistachios and cherries and something else where the main ingredient was chocolate. So the food was excellent but the service was unreal. Everyone is very nice and willing to help diners and they are all very knowledgeable too. I really liked the whole experience.
