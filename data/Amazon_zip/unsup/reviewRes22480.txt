So I've been passing this place for years and years and never knew exactly what it was. I thought it was your regular hot dog spot. Anyways, my boyfriend and I decided to go here and pulled into what we thought was the parking lot, but it was a drive-in!!! We were amazed and never knew that such a place still existed! But this place is really cool. We were kind of slow as we tried to figure out what we had to do, but we caught on and enjoyed our food in the car. The food was good but what I didn't like was that the hot dog and fries were so cramped in a tiny box...I like food separation. The service was okay considering that there were a lot of cars there. But I thought that Superdawg's was a fun and different experience. I'd love to go back with other friends and have them check it out.
