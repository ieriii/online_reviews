I recently went to Carnivale and was very happy when I left. First, if you are going to order an appetizer you must try the guacamole- I don't know which was better, the chips or the guacamole but they were both out of this world. As for drinks- you can't go wrong with a mojito- or two like I had. For dinner try the steak or the chicken dishes and you will not be unhappy.
