What I wouldn't give to be sitting in this place 90 years ago when the place was newly renovated and the roar of the 1920's was brand new. But alas, I must live with what I am given and being able to walk into this place on any given day of the week still takes my breath away. Mainly because I can see the remnants of what use to be. Anyways, I am sure that this place would be rated higher if the staff weren't always turning their nose at those that don't quite fit in. I understand the job can be tiring but give a girl a break. I visit here once in a great while just to feel like I was meant to live in a different era. The music on most nights is amazing, especially when you catch that great group that you only pay $10-$15 see. The drinks vary from night to night and I expect to pay more at the bar for the atmosphere than the service. I will continue to visit this place when I feel like transporting myself (minus the time machine) back to a time when things were... different. I do recommend this bar to those that have the same respect for jazz music as I do, and don't mind the staff's off-beat attitudes for the great atmosphere. I do NOT recommend this to those looking for a place to dance on a bar to the "next big pop act" and drink "shooters" to get to0 drunk to remember where they left their inhibitions.
