Conveniently located right across the Green Mill, we ate dinner here while waiting for Patricia Barber to take the stage. We ordered the Vegetarian Messob For Two, chosing these 6 demera dishes: ye-shimbra assa, kik alicha, shiro, gomen, quosta, and tikle gomen. They came out on a platter of injera and with an extra basket of injera - the Ethiopian sourdough flatbread that also serves as eating utensils. Everything was delicious. My favorite was ye-shimbra assa: ground chickpeas cooked in berbere sauce. My boyfriend's favorite was the shiro. We both preferred the spinach over the collards, and we both really enjoyed the carrot/ cabbage dish (tikle gomen). The injera bread was great - a little tart, like sourdough, and spongey.  Highly recommend Demera for all who are in (or passing through) the Chicago area.
