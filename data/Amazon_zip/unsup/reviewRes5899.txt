WOW, I just came back from dinner at Davanti and I can't say enough good things about both the food and the service my friend and I received here tonight. Our server, Catherine, I think her name was, made our experience so wonderful and helped us make some really great choices with the food (even though everything here looks AMAZING). First, we got seated on the roof top, and although it was a cool fall night, the roof top at Davanti is heated and has lanterns everywhere and is very cozy. Our server helped us pick out a great bottle of wine and suggested her favorite appetizers. We had the egg toast with truffles and Oh My God, I can't even come close to describing how good it was. The truffle taste is very distinct and tastes amazing with creaminess of the eff and fontina. We then had a mushroom truffle pizza and the Davanti burger which were both fantastic. You will be long dreaming about them after you leave. Overall, Davanti is now one of my favorite restaurants and such a great versatile place where you can go on a re all romantic date night, a group dinner or just a fun night out with a friend. This place is such a gem and worth going to MANY times.
