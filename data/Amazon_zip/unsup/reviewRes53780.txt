paid a $12 dollar cover only to walk in & receive rude & pretentious service from the bar staff. Ended up leavin without finishing our drinks. And I'm not just some disgruntled needy patron, I'm actually a 10 year service industry/bartender veteran. I know good service and I know bad. Green mills was definitely not good. It's a shame cause the ambiance is nice & the place has great character & potential. Oh well.
