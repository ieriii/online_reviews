Having been to Crisp several times, I can now give it a good rating that I can stick with. The food is great. The service is good. My only quibble is the price. Honestly, almost $9 for a chicken sandwich, a can of soda, and some fries? Good place if you're really in the mood for chicken, but I just haven't been that impressed by anything else on the menu. EDIT: I'm keeping the original review up for reference. They lowered the price on the Chicken Sandwich with fries and a drink, and it's now very affordable. With that in mind, I'm bumping them up to 5 stars. Next time you go in, tell them Adam sent you. Why Adam? Because I'm there so much they know me by name. Enjoy!
