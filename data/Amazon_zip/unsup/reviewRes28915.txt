Unimpressive. Not worth the wait. I've had countless Mexican meals that blow this place away in taste and in value. For anyone familiar with authentic Mexican food, take a pass on this one. Don't listen to the ignorant "foodies" who claim how amazing this is but only go based on a chef's brand-name. Guacamole - Fresh but average. Similar to pre-packaged store bought stuff. Sopes Rancheros - Whatever. Why did I even put that in my mouth? Such a waste of calories. Enchiladas de Mole Poblano - Good attempt but also unimpressive. If you like raisin heavy mole, then this one is for you. I like many types of mole and this was was blah. What's clear is that there's an understanding of the complexity of this sauce (the waitress touted the 28 ingredients), but what's also clear is that their execution is seriously lacking. The sauce just wasn't balanced very well. Too acidic and sweet, not rich or nutty enough. Also, why use expensive Gunthorp free-range chicken if you're just gonna overcook it? I'd rather have cheap sauce from a mole packet with corn-fed steroid-packed cooped-up chicken that is cooked correctly. If you like mole, go to Red Iguana in SLC... not this place.
