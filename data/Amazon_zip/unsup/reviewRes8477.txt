We always have a nothing less than a wonderful experience at Spacca Napoli! This isn't your thick, Chicago style pizza...it's authentic Napolian style. I've been to Naples and for those of you who want to taste what authentic Italian pizza really tastes like (without packing your bags for Europe) then this is the #1 place to go! I highly recommend the buffalo cheese mozzarella appetizer and the margarita pizza with extra sauce!
