I have visited 5 times now and only 1 dish has been anything else other than tremendous. They have a tremendous whiskey list and a good beer and wine selection to go along with their delicious offerings. The service is not always the best and the lack of reservations is a bit annoying to me, but their food makes up for these minor issues.
