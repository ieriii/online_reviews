The wife and I come here at least once a month for breakfast. The Challah French toast is so delicious! Coffee is great too. Andreaa is the best server there. She is awesome! Ask to sit in her section. Service is tops. Does not disappoint. Update: I miss the meli cafe. I have yet to find something in Florida that even comes close to it.
