Three and a half starts, actually. My husband and I celebrated a special dinner here, and while we certainly enjoyed our experience, it didn't live up to expectations. We went for the Saturday Underground menu. It was fun to try a variety of different plates, but of the five, only two were outstanding. Two were above average, and the last was, well, okay. The service was a bit off, as a few plates were served lukewarm when they should have been hot. Also, we waited for a prolonged period of time before our main course... while several tables around us were finishing up with their main dish. The space is tiny, which I think lends itself to a warm and intimate environment, but we were seated aside two very, very loud and obnoxious women whose voices made us want to jab our knives in our eyes. All in all, we had a very enjoyable and fun evening. The experience is unique to Chicago, and of course it's always fun to discover a fine-dining BYO.
