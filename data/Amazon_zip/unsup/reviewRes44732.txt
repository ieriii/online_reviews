I had such a terrible experience with the service at this place that I'm giving them 1 star just to be an a$$hole and do my part to lower their yelp rating average.  The service was so bad that it was actually about 2 years ago that I was there and I'm still mad about it.  I wrote a formal complaint letter and never got a response. My friend and I were talking about this place today, and she had an even worse experience than I did.  There are better options for pizza in Chicago folks, go somewhere where they treat their customers well.
