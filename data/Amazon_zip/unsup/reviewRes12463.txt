I'm the 800th person to review Cafe 28, but I have never been disappointed. We made reservations for 16 people for my birthday last weekend, and they were super accommodating, and the food was wonderful. The night went off without a hitch! I love the Ropa Vieja and it was perfect as usual!  Our waiter was great and funny, and literally there wasn't a single misstep. Nothing was forgotten!
