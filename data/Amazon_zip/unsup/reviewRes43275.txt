Wow. Look at all you little yelpers enamored with Milk & Honey. Pray tell, what am I missing?????? I went there on Saturday morning and was greeted by a huge clusterfu*k line. I expect lines anywhere in Chicago around brunch hours, those are just the breaks... but when people are constantly bumping you and squeezing themselves into a tiny space where they don't fit it just promotes aggravation and bad attitudes. Two things I don't really prefer with my breakfast. Apparently the Milk & Honey system is that you order your food, pay and tip (if you're using plastic) all before they'll give you a number for your table. Hmmm... tip BEFORE I'm even served or try the food? Seems a little assbackwards don't it?! So I make my way up to the ordering station and menu (finally!) and I immediately feel hurried to order and make a decision. A tapping pen and searing eyes can do that to me. I guess it should not have been hard as they only have 6 choices on the menu, so I went with the Huevos Rancheros casserole style and made my way back outside to wait. Again.  Another 30 minutes later, I'm finally in my seat and here comes the food!!! The bff had the Orange Brioche French Toast... ehhhh it was alright. Nothing spectacular but substantial breakfast fare and it beats an Egg McMuffin I guess. The Huevos were actually really good, pretty much the best thing on their menu I assume. Our waitress never came back to check on us and the whole experience felt very cafeteria-ish. I'm placing my bets that off hours and weekdays would yield a better and much less stressful experience. Oh and plus 1 star for the homemade granola, it looked and smelled divine!!
