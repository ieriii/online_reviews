Unbelievable. I am shocked to see such high ratings for such a mediocre restaurant....it makes me question my taste. I've been here a handful of times and ordered something different each time from salads to pizza to some chicken dish. Eh. Ehhhhhh. The two good things about this place is the location-definitely location, and the service was always good for how busy this place is. I didn't think people actually came here b/c the food is good (it's not), I thought it was busy because of the location. Guess I was wrong and guess I'm the only one who thinks the food here sucks.
