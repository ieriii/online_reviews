Went there for dinner last Friday expecting good food and good drinks. I left feeling unsatisfied and ripped off. What restaurant/bar only has 1 type of Vodka to choose from??? That set the stage for what was a truly forgettable experience... First, you can barely read the menu because it's so dark in there and you only have a small candle that barely sheds any light. Hey, I'm all for ambiance but I'd like to be able to see what I'm ordering! Next (as mentioned above) I tried to order a Grey Goose & Tonic but was informed they only have some weird organic vodka. Okay?!???!? After I finally found something to order off of the mediocre menu I asked for some bread. I was told they would have to charge me for it, but since I was so hungry I went ahead and got it any way. When it arrived there was no butter so I politely asked the waitress for some. She told me they didn't have butter and that if I wanted bread with some sort of topping I should have ordered one of their appetizers. I was absolutely floored by her response! I almost had to beg her to go to the kitchen and try to "find" some freakin' butter. She finally agreed and miraculously "found" some. Who would have thought that you could find butter in a kitchen in a restaurant??? The pasta with chicken dish that I ordered was OK. It was very rich. My wife had the pork meatballs which were pretty good except two of them were burnt. When I pointed that out to the waitress she said "that's how they normally come" and then walked away. Unbelievable!! Fortunately for the waitress we had a party of six so the gratuity was already added because she wouldn't have received anything from me otherwise. All in all this place is ridiculous. It's overpriced, pretentious and the wait staff clearly doesn't realize they are supposed to be service oriented. I will never go back there...EVER!
