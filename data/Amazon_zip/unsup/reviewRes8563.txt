We really enjoyed the pizza here. No disappointments there. One area where they could really improve is their beer selection. Serving Peroni because it is italian is a complete joke. You might as well drink budweiser. There are numerous craft beers (even a few from italy) that would pair very well with their food. It's clear they put a lot of thought into their food and wine options, I wish the same was done for the world's greatest beverage, beer.
