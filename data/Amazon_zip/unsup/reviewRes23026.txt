Irazu, I love you... but the other night... that wasn't right. I waited 2 hours for your food for our dinner party, and you forgot all the sides. You said you'd call back...but then you closed, without any word. We were so hungry and even ordered extra food for your chips and salsa on a $30+ meal - but they weren't in the bag either. Grubhub made it all better, and I think in time the wounds will heal and I'll come crawling back. We all have our bad nights, right? Edit: Very prompt response by owner. I forgive you Irazu... let's do dinner again soon. 4 stars it is.
