I am not sure if I'd be back here if it weren't BYOB. It's a nice little family-owned Italian restaurant next to the Metra track on Wilson. It's always decently crowded, but never too crowded. Basically, the food is way too salty, and the service is extremely slow. The waiter was very knowledgeable and all, but he couldn't have been any less attentive -but it wasn't his fault. They desperately need more WAIT STAFF!!! I couldn't believe only one guy was taking care over at least a dozen tables by himself. Not surprisingly, service is really really slow although the bus boy did a great job filling up my water glass. I had been here about 9 months ago on a date, and I went back there recently with my brother. Both times, service was consistently slow since they were short on waiters. Food was good, but consistently too saucy and salty. I usually prefer independent restaurants over chain restaurants, but I'd rather eat at Francesca's or Tuscany's before eating here. I do like their menu. Many regional specialties. It is a great addition to the neighborhood though.
