If you can stand the heat this is a good chinese restaurant. I tasted the kung pao chicken, crispy duck w/plum sauce, egg drop soup and egg rolls. TYhe kung pao chicken was great. The sauce was just right not over powering or to light. The egg drop soup was rich and delicious, the egg roll were average and the crispy duck was a little bland but the plum sauce pump it up sevel levels. Overall I had a great meal and will definitely go back.
