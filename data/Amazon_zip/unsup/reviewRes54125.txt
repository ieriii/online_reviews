One meal here rocked my world! My brother and sis-in-law took me here last weekend and it was damn hard to choose. Finally I had the carnitas caldo [soup]: rich, peppery, garlicky, clear broth with a generous portion of roasted pork carnitas, corn-potato dumplings, a couple slices of roasted zucchini, garnished with fresh avocado, fresh mild arugula, and fresh lime. Amazing! If you eat pork, ORDER THIS. It changed my life. The fresh lime juice completed the perfect combination of flavors and textures. The cooked corn chips right out of the cooker had a perfume like no other: earthy, probably just-ground corn (some heirloom variety, I bet). I inhaled the aroma over the dish and probably got high.  Amazing! The guac was good, and the red and green chile sauces were interesting & complex. I ordered Aztec chocolate [score one for Kris, who correctly predicted which one I would order before I ever came here], dark chocolate with chilis and allspice. This was so rich I took forever to drink it, and augmented my flour-corn-tortilla-smell high. My life will never be the same. I'll come back as soon as I can get here. And probably order the same thing.
