It's a bar with classed up bar food. Don't get me wrong, it's really really good bar food, but let's call a spade a spade. Between the classed up bar food and the extensive whiskey list, bf can't get enough. We've gone a couple times in the last few months. There was a bit of a wait even though I thought we were there at random times but that's why there's a bar. Good drink menu and knowledgeable bartenders (with impressive facial hair) are at your service. The wait staff is equally friendly and prompt. However, don't tell me that you're giving me "complimentary house purified water." It's called a Brita filter, bitch, I have one of those, too. Again, let's call a spade a spade.  The food is really good. Bf always looks like he's died and gone to heaven when he is eating whatever he gets. Honestly, I could be described as a "picky" eater so there isn't a ton on the menu that jumps out at me, so I've had the burger (and loved it) both times. My favorite part is when they try to give my burger to my bf. No dice. I'm sure we'll be back as bf LOVES it, but it's a little pretentious for my taste.
