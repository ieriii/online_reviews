I think I'm officially giving up on deep dish. I was excited for Pequod's and thought that *this* was going to be the moment I discover REALLY good deep dish but it didn't happen. I did like the caramelized crust but it's still a lot of dough and a lot of sauce. If you have vegetarians with you or those who simply don't like certain ingredients, it's possible to only have toppings on half the pizza. Their garlic bread with cheese appetizer is tasty but you can't go wrong with anything melted cheese! I agree with a lot of Yelpers--they have GOT to change that horrible blue awning in front! It's a lot nicer inside and deceptively small (the 2nd floor is huge!).
