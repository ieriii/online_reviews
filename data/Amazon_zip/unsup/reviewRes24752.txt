I ordered the setas al horno (mushrooms), patatas bravas (potatoes with spicy aioli), tocino (pork belly), and the short rib flatbread as take-out since I was staying in the hotel across the street for business. Everything was amazing! The mushrooms were really rich but delicious. The pork belly was my favorite. I can't wait to come back to Chicago so I can try more dishes from here!
