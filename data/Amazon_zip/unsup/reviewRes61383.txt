I took a client to this location for lunch. It was just perfect, she needed a respite from work stress and the pleasant patio, wonderful and attentive service and fantastic food did the trick.We each ordered a sandwich and basket of plantain chips and both ended up taking food home as the portions were generous.We left feeling satiated, relaxed and happy. The entire staff bid us farewell with, "See you tomorrow!"
