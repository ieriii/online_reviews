My husband has always left here feeling like a king... and for me, it's a hit or miss. We came on a summer day for lunch and I enjoyed a lemonade-ish margarita, the sopes appetizer and the dueling flans (guava and vanilla). I did not like my entree or the flauta appetizers, though. On another visit, I had a pineapple, cucumber lemonade which I really enjoyed! I had the sopes again (can't go wrong there) but the other appetizers were fushi/guacatelas/not tasty! All I could taste from the tamales was the awkward flavor left behind by whatever leaf was used. I could not taste the chorizo or bacon or cheese that was visible to the eye. We also had a queso fundido made of pork that was made with a pungent cheese (in my opinion, of course). My husband agreed with me about the tamales but he thoroughly enjoyed the queso fundido. The smell bothered me for quite a while. My original order was taken back to the kitchen because it just tasted terrible. I won't even bother saying what it was because I have found that I have not liked any of the entrees here! I had two entrees on this day and the only thing that I was able to eat without cursing were the refried beans, tortillas and guacamole. We ordered the dueling flans again (chocolate ones with liquor and vanilla) and they did not disappoint. I expect the food to be Mexican with a twist. I just didn't realize that the twists would be so weird sometimes. My husband owns some of Rick Bayless' cookbooks--I really believe some of the recipes are awesome. We have been able to impress my mother, who is Mexican and cooks like a pro! I wouldn't have thought the same author owned this restaurant based on the entrees I've had. Then again, maybe Rick Bayless is always experimenting. I know I will keep coming to Frontera Grill--my husband loves it--but from now on, I will stick with those sopes, drinks and flans!
