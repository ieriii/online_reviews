I've eaten at Carnivale 3 times and have had excellent dishes every visit. If it's in your price range and it's what you're craving you are going to have an excellent meal. I would knock this down My latest visit was just as good as the others. Some Brazilian beer, Manchego cheese to start it off, and I ended with the Churrasco wood grilled beef that had a ridiculously good spicy beet salsa.
