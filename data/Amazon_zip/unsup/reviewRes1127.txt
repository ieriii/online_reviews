Ok, my husband and I went here about a year ago...right after we got married. And we went today - the day before our one year wedding anniversary. I have a feeling that this will be our anniversary place.  This was our first experience of the duck fat fries. I'm very glad we shared an order...while I wanted to eat them all myself because they were soooooooo good, I felt my arteries clogging with each bite. Probably the best fries I've eaten.  My husband ordered the Mauricio Umansky - Saucisson Alsacienne: Bacon Sausage with Creme Fraiche, Caramelized Onions and Saint Angel Cheese. HELLO BACON SAUSAGE! Bacon encased meat? A piece of heaven on California Avenue. The Saint Angel cheese...it was like a richer, creamier, more divine camembert cheese. I had the Cherry and Apple Pork Sausage with Sir William Pear Mustard and Vosges Bacon Chocolate. VOSGES BACON CHOCOLATE ON my sausage. Sounds strange, but it works incredibly well.  Oh, and, as always, all the people that work here are incredibly friendly. I might get cranky working here because I'd want to eat everything that everyone ordered.  Well done, Hot Doug's. Well done. I hope to see you again soon. But, if I don't, I'll see you for our second anniversary.
