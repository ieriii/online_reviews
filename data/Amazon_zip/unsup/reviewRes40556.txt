So I was hanging out with my friend in Chicago all afternoon into the late night. We hit up some Chinese place that was excellent, had sundaes at Margie's Candies, and then he forced me to come here to have a taco even though I was stuffed. I wasn't impressed with the overall semi-lack of cleanliness but it sure was crowded. Oh boy, was I glad I came though. I only got one carne asada (steak) taco y arroz con frijoles (rice and beans) but it was AMAZING. I haven't had such a good taco since I don't know when. It came on two little tortillas and I put some pico de gallo on it. It was stuffed so full that I couldn't get a handle on that greasy little sucker. But once I took that perfect first bite, I couldn't put it down. All memories of binging previously that day were gone and I went to town. The rice and beans weren't as impressive but what could be next to that taco??? I am traveling back next week to Chicago and am insisting we come here for a late night snack...or huge meal. 4.5 stars!
