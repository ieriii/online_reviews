Huge customer service problem that they need to fix ASAP. Great pizza, but I had a very negative experience with this place just now. I placed an order for delivery, and there was a misunderstanding regarding my address. My address was out of their range, but they misheard me over the phone and thought that it was a different location that they DID serve. When the driver called me and learned that I was out of range by a few miles, he said he wasn't authorized to make the call to drive a little further to complete the delivery and told me to call management . The manager flat out stonewalled me and gave no consideration to the fact that I just wasted an hour of my life waiting for a pizza that didnt come. I offered additional money, I was willing to do everything short of drive to meet him as I didn't have a car to do so. As if the extra 10-15 minutes of driver time on a sunday was really going to put a dent in the bottom line. An exception would have been ideal, but there was not offer of any compensation for my time. The guy acted like it was my fault they took down the wrong damn address. Soup nazis are only funny on Seinfeld. I'm done with this place.
