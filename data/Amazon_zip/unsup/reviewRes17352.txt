If I'd written this review after my first visit to The Violet Hour I would have given it five stars, but after this past weekend I'm so irked that I have to put it in writing. We showed up at 6:30pm on a Friday night with a group of about ten. They didn't have room and took my cell number, saying they'd call when something was ready, so we went somewhere else. Around 8pm we got a call saying a table would be open at 8:30. Another call at 8:25 inviting us to come back. Very nice. That made me happy. My smile quickly faded when we got there. The doorman immediately informs all of us that YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO USE CELL PHONES INSIDE and you'll be kicked out if you do. Are you joking me? What is this, high school? I thought that was completely absurd, and planned on using my cell phone all I damn well pleased. Then he tells me that if the rest of my party isn't there in ten minutes they won't be admitted. I felt like hitting him square in the mouth. It was my freaking birthday and my friends wouldn't be able to come because they didn't know to show up at exactly 8:30? A couple people arrived a half hour later and called me to let me know that I had to come up front to get them (and I answered my phone, so THERE!). Then they sent a girl back to our table to "make sure there was room" for them. Christ, how ridiculously pretentious can you get? Forget this place. I can make Moscow Mules at home and they won't cost me $12 a pop or come with a heaping side of attitude. Anyone who stands outside waiting to get into this place is an idiot. I was absolutely enchanted the first time I went here. The decor is a beautiful, eclectic mix between Victorian England and Alice in Wonderland. It's a shame that they're so desperate to be exclusive and chic. I'll never go back.
