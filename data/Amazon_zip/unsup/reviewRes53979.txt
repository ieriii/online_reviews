Alright, so I was definitely pretty stoked about trying this place out. It wasn't a let down, per se, but it didn't overly wow me as some others have written.The staff was super friendly - definitely a very chill vibe, they helped with our order and even gave us some recommendations. Pretty cool and much appreciated.The food was stellar - I ordered the Cubano, although I expected it to be much bigger...they definitely hired some good photographers for their website, as the pics don't really accurately reflect what you get.With that said it was definitely solid, very tasty. I also ordered the goat cheese empanada, which I'd recommend in a heartbeat (I can't see how you could mess up a pastry filled with goat cheese...).Quick note though on the shakes that everyone raves about....I definitely saw this dude load up five HUGE spoonfulls of sugar into the shake...like massive scoops. So, if you're wondering why they are so good, I'd say just know that those things are really, really not good for you. You wouldn't normally consumer that much sugar in a week, I'd guess. Pretty absurd and probably over the top.So all in all I'd say check it out - but don't go in with expectations that you're going to embark on a spirtual journey of tastiness.
