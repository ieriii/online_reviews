I love my Pequod's. The carmelized cheese on the crust puts this at the top of my Chicago pizzas list. It also helps that I've never waited more than ten minutes for a table (of course, I eat during grandpa times, but that didn't help at Gino's East). Decent beers, decent atmosphere, good salads, but you're here for the pizza, and it's the best there is.
