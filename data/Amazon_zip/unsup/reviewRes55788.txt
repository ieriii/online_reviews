If you are a true Italian food fan this sits up there with the best. It's far from the corporate put together places of today (so if that's what you like you will be disapointed). If you want a traditional mom and pop italian restaurant that feels like an episode of good fellas, you gotta check this place out. Hopefully, I've given you a visual.As for the food, go there with an apetite. It is by far the best italian food that I have ever had. If your a fettuccini alfredo fan: try it with peas and sundried tomatoes, I guarantee you won't be disappointed.
