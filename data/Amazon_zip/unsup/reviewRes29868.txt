This is one of the first places I ate at in Chicago and I am HOOKED!!! A non-vegan meat-lover directed me there, saying it was one of his favorite (!) places in the 'hood. Everything I've ever had there has been stupendous, outside of the sweet potato quesadilla, which was average. But the Karma burger, "turkey bacon" club, and any and everything else has been amazing! Service is fast and if you strike up a conversation, very friendly.  The chai milkshakes are to die for and the vegan whipped cream is actually better than real. Seriously. I wouldn't believe it myself but it is. Also the vegan mac and cheese. They have some of the best vegan "dairy" products out there, and this coming from someone who avoids vegan cheese at all costs cuz it generally tends to suck. Not here. The only real con is that the booths are designed oddly and difficult to get into and out of. Not where you want to sit if you are even slightly out of shape or overweight or with any type of handicap. Seriously. They are weird. Luckily, there are also tables for those so inclined (or relegated). Do yourself a big big favor and eat here... NOW!! It is not at all hard to get a table here, another big plus!
