We are always impressed with the atmosphere and wonderful service at Demera, the staff are always warm and accomodating and helpful with making choices for our dinner. The decor is beautiful and the bathrooms are gorgeous and hygiene conscious! We had a dinner for 2 Groupon that was an excellent value, tons of food and variety of flavors. The fried pastry appetizers are awesome, the best is the chicken, it is chock full of flavor! We love the vegetarian main dishes here too, the red lentils are excellent! My only complaint is the bones in the lamb dishes, some were very small and could easily be accidentally swallowed and cause injury.
