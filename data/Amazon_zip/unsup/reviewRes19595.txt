I've been here three times, and each time for dinner - never lunch like the rest of 'em (pbbbbt). Staff is excellent. Knowledgeable, courteous and prompt. My servers, for the most part seemed to know to leave me alone and let me and my company enjoy dinner. The first time I went with a friend and had the elk, I think? I remember it being fantastic, but I couldn't tell you in what way. We had so much food and it kept on coming, so I couldn't really remember anything but, "good" or "kickass." This last time, I took a special lady friend there for our first "date." (I totally had this chick at "hello" by the way, so it wouldn't have mattered if I took her to Al's Beef either). She loved it. We shared appetizers in a tucked booth. The booths are great, isolated away from the bar crowd and noise, enabling me and my companion to get to know each other without interruption.  We had the mussels which were done perfect in whatever tomato-based broth they do it in. The crostini or toast that they serve is crack on dough and they just keep bringing it to you with each dish! Get away! No, don't. The rabbit salad - fantastic and light. My date is a big fan of cheese, so we ordered the fondue which was outstanding. Very hearty for a first course, and WAY better than Little Caeser's Cheesy Bread. After that, it was just me and her, snacking and talking for a while, with no rush on the restaurant's part to get us out of there on a Friday night. Even with her extreme PDA (I'm irresistible at this point in the date), we were comfortable in our little booth world with no interruption or staring. They should be doing more business I think, but it's a touristy area - probably hard to get local Chicagos to really believe there's something over there. Fine by me. I'll keep going back there especially if I don't have to wait on a Friday and enjoy a nice time with a beautiful young lady!
