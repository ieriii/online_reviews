I will only bring out of towners to try Pequod's deep dish. Other places are good, but Pequod's blows all the rest out of the water. If you read most of the people who reviewed and gave less than 3 stars you'll note that they all mention they didn't order the deep dish. There might've been a few that did order the deep dish - but you can't please everyone. Apparently, the trick here, is to only get the deep dish, otherwise, it's anyones guess how your meal will turn out. This place is great, in my opinion. My suggestion: Deep dish, at the location (delivery might render a slightly more mushy pizza), beer and one topping only. This is why I minus one star from the five star pizza. The toppings issue. They're $2 for each damn topping! $2 for onion?? Seriously - I should omit 2 stars for that sort of tom foolery but the crust is so good that I can't. I love this pizza. Maybe bring some mushrooms, onions and other easy to fold away in your pocket foods to top the pizza once it gets to you. :) But then that's just kinda weird. People might stare. Either way, this pizza is rock star!
