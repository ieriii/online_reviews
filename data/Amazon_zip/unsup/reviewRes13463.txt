Bacon Popcorn = Overrated. Came out cold & the cheese on top looked like a sheep's bellybutton lint. Chicago Style Tofu Dog = Tofu was good, but not in the shape of a hotdog, in fact it was 2 small rectangles that were perfect because the bun was the stalest thing I have eaten since I was a prostitute. The relish was insanely neon which I really liked. Sport peppers were big and tasted fresh. Baked Potato Pizza = It was actually quite good at first but the second piece tasted richer than the creator of the IPad. Who has been reported as richer than the federal government, so yeah. It was pretty rich. Mashed Potatoes with Cream Cheese and Garlic = tastiest thing here that I have had so far. I tasted a bite of my friend's burger and it was pretty good. I want to try belly shack before I go here again.
