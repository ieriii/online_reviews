About a month ago, me and 10 of my girls had dinner here to celebrate a birthday. We had a great time while there, but soon after reality set in for half of us: FOOD POISONING. We all work at a busy Gold Coast salon, and 2 of us (one was the birthday girl) had to cancel their fully booked saturdays, one had a flight sat pm and had to change her seat so she was closer to the bathroom, and the rest of us were just left feeling miserable and clinging to the toilet. We all understand that is a risk taken when going to eat raw fish, but the reason im writing this review is because we have been treated so horribly by the management staff since the incident. We had to call repeatly to the GM, who seemed annoyed that we were bothering him, when we could actually get him on the phone. Some of us received $50 gift certificates in "compensation", which came along with use restrictions: only good sun-thurs, and only 1 per table. This is unacceptable for a group who spent $900, that IF we ever go back we cant use the "gift" certificates together. Anyone in the restaurant business knows that $50 in a gift card only really costs the restaurant about $15 in food. And the girls who had to cancel their clients easily lost about $500 each.This should be horribly embarrassing for Sunda, Rockit Ranch Productions, and i think Billy Dec would be horrified to know that his customers, who got violently ill, were treated like this. A restaurant of this caliber should know the importance of customer service, especially with a group of busy, chatty, Gold Coast haridressers.
