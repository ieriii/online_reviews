Tourist Trap! I have been here twice, and both times were extreme disappointments. 1st visit was a business lunch with 3 people. We all ordered, but the Server forgot to place my order. So, it never came. I told him. He said it would be right out. It never came, it never came, it never came. Finally, when we were leaving, it showed up. I told them I didin't want it. They took it off my bill, but WTH? A few months later, I returned. There were 2 of us. We waited & waited & waited for a Server. Finally, we asked another Employee who was supposed to be waiting on us. She said she'd find out for us. Soon thereafter, we found that our Server had been standing in a corner, watching us since we arrived. She said, "I had no idea this was my section." And, it went downhill from there. There are several other places on & around Michigan Ave you can visit which are better & less expensive with far better service.
