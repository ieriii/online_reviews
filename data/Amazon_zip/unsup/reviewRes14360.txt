Love, love, love. Pros: The chimichurri beef was absurdly good (though slightly on the salty side, but I like salt). Goat cheese empanadas - wowsers. BYOB and I did. Good service. Cons: My husband's ropa vieja sandwich was a little dry (or something was off) for me, but he loved it. GO GO GO. Right now. :)
