The best, repeat, THE BEST DEEP DISH IN CHICAGO. We will get to the pizza in a moment, but first, everything else... Great local beer selection, great menu (outside of the pizza), fun atmosphere and a very nice staff. The pizza...life changing. For me, anytime you can say that the last bite you have of a meal is the best, well, you have yourself a good meal. It says something of a place when each bite gets better and better. Eat your meat loaded pizzas with a knife and fork, then save the crust and a tiny bit of sauce that escapes from your pie for dipping. The crust is the...freaking...best. The restaurant has been using the same deep dish pans since the dawn of man and all of those little garlic, cheese, oil and meat juices from the pans are seared right into the crust for the climax. I find it amazing that I can say that the best part of this pizza is the crust. Everything else is great...the cheese, the meats, the sauces...but the crust. Wow. If you are visiting Chicago and want some authentic deep dish, this is the spot where the locals go. And, it's never as insanely busy as the other touristy places that serve deep dish. It's very casual and feels like a neighborhood joint, which it totally is.
