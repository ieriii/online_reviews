Duck feast! Let's do this! (but call ahead, or no duck feast for you) This has to be one of the best places for groups - it's huge and there are plenty of large tables (with lazy Susans to spin the food all around - wee!). I had no idea what I was doing, so I deferred to the experts in our group of 7. We ended up with two ducks and assorted veggies. So how does this work? Ducky is brought out the first time for you to admire and watch along as the server cuts off his skin (?) and top-meats (like, one layer? whatever, I'm not a biologist). These parts go on the lazy Susan and can be eaten plain or with bao wrappers. Delish. Duck goes back to the kitchen. Duck comes back as a soup! And rice! And noodles! He's in everything. Eat him up. Small gross-out/annoyance: Before the food came, I took a trip to the ladies room and stepped into a puddle that went up to my ankle. God only knows what was in that puddle and I so wish that I'd been paying more attention because at that point I kind of wanted to saw my leg off and die. It didn't dampen my appetite, but it was a bit of a buzzkill.
