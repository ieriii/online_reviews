Eh i think deep dish isn't for me. It took 45 minutes to cook, but it's such a massive pie i guess can understand. Its pretty much just cheese until you get near the crust- then theres a good proportion of cheese, sauce and crust. I'm not a huge cheese fan so i wasn't too into this place. Umm plus a guy was stabbed outside while we were there.
