Piece is great on a Saturday afternoon--fantastic pizza (goat cheese, spinach, mushroom and sausage--to die for!) and house-made beer...doesn't get much better than that on a cold winter day! I don't think I'd go here on Saturday night (karaoke makes me cringe), but I will keep this place as one of my favorite Saturday afternoon spots!
