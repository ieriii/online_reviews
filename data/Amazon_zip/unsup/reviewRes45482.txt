I thought this was a great place. While in the neighborhood, we decided to eat somewhere nearby... since we've been to The Bagel a few times in Old Orchard, Wilde won out. It's a gorgeous restaurant, and I love how they have a little "library" space there. This little area has small tables, as well as a round table to sit and have drinks at; the towering bookshelves are filled with (I assume to be real) books. The waitstaff was courteous and attentive, and the food was good. I had the mac & cheese, which was great. It was amazingly fast - we ordered our food and it came out within 5 or 10 minutes. When we first got there, around 5:30 on a Thursday, it was no problem getting a table; when we left a while later it was starting to fill up. I do love the fact that the restaurant revolves around Oscar Wilde. The only disappointment, if you could call it that, was that our appetizer came just a couple minutes before our entrees. The entree was tasty - I never would have thought to combine french fries and curry, but it was good.
