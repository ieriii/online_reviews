the places it's great atmosfere ,decoration employees very nice and polite but the food it's terrible try to resemble cuban food! not even close could be a gourmet food not even the portions are miserable!! too salty , the meet taste old thit no consistency! the adobo it was no were to be found on my pork, the short ribs for my husband really he can make a taco that big was the portion,! unfortunally i would not recomend the place to any of my friends the food in general !!!OVER PRICE$ ! i hope they can improve the cuisine!! or change the chef !!
