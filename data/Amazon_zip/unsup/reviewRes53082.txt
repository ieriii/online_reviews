went with 2 others and we shared the chicken, the bistec and the ropa vieja. the last one was by far the favorite, so flavorful! bursting with flavor, though it was ever so slightly a bit tough. the bistec with chimichurri was probably least favorite, we have made it better at home. black beans and rice were excellent! will definitely be going back here in the future. especially with byo too.
