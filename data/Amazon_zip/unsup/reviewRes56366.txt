Came in here last night. We did not have a reservation and the place was getting busy. They were able to squeeze in our table, and were seated within 15 minutes. Great food, service was pretty good. All the foods were fresh tasting and it all came out on a timely manner considering how many people were there. We'll definitely come back again especially with the BYOB they allow us :)
