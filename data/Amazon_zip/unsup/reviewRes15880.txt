I really want to love Carnivale, but the most I can give is 3.5 stars. Let's start with something positive. The atmosphere is colorful, energetic and fun. As for the rest... I had a 7pm reservation and we weren't seated until 7:30. A few other parties with the same reservation time asked the hostess what was happening with their tables and were told they'd have to wait a little longer. That's a bit of a bummer. the mojitos are definitely solid. It's hard to get a really good mojito, so I definitely appreciate it. We started with a ceviche, but it was just five small pieces of fish with some tiny veggies and sauce on top... looked more like a sashimi app. Don't expect any chips or anything like a traditional "ceviche" at all. Oh, and those five tiny pieces of fish are $12. It would have been nice to have something more to chew on for that. The short rib and chicken were both pretty good. Nothing bad to say there. Service was slow which I don't generally mind as I like to take my time, but I was drink-less for a good thirty minutes. 15-20 with an empty glass and another 10-15 to have the ordered drink brought to me. Thumbs down on that one. Bonus: valet parking is only $5. I wish more restaurants priced it that way!
