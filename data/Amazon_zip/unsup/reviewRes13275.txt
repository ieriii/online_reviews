My girlfriend and I went for a late dinner on a Tuesday, not knowing that it was all-you-can-eat king crab leg night. There were a couple open tables, thank goodness, about an hour before they closed. The rest of the tables were taken up by big dogs eating king crab legs. I'm guessing that one of the best parts about being a big dog going to town on all-you-can-eat king crab legs is when the small dogs like me at nearby tables eyeball you with envy. We split the big seafood salad which was good, plenty of smoked trout and lobster in there.  For the main my girlfriend and I split the cornmeal panfried catfish with brocoli, celery and hollandaise. The flavors were excellent and it was a warm and filling meal. There was a side of smoky macaroni and cheddar cheese involved. For dessert we split a piece of key lime pie- about a quarter of a pie for seven dollars. Its a big piece. On the side we got vanilla ice cream and bananas foster. Bananas foster side is basically a bowl of caramel swimming with hot banana. It all seemed too much but she is going away for a few days and I needed the sweets to soothe the pangs of loneliness. I ate the whole thing. Maybe I was just trying to prove I'm one of the big dogs.
