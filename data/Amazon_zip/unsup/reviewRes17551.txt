My friend and I had been craving Indian food and opted to try India House for the first time during their lunch buffet. They definitely have a bigger spread than most Indian lunch buffets, but the food was a bit bland for my taste. The vegetable okra dish had the most spice & flavor and the chicken masala was very tasty. $15.95 pp for lunch...not really worth it.
