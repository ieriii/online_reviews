Went here with my Viet parents and loved it! Not as cheap as what you would find in say, Orange County, but reasonably priced. The service was much better than some of the other Vietnamese restaurants I have been to in the area. Also, the serving portions are quite large.  If you're new to vietnamese food, I recommend the Pho (beef noodle soup) and the Bun Thit Nuong (a bowl of delicious strips of marinated beef and a crispy egg roll atop rice vermicelli, lettuce, mint and cucumber). The fish sauce that comes with the Bun Thit Nuong is not to everyone's taste, but at least give it a try because that definitely makes the dish (otherwise it is pretty bland without it. I guess you could substitute soy sauce.. but c'mon, be a little adventurous).  Make sure to get the Vietnamese summer rolls as an appetizer (rice vermicelli noodles, shrimp, lettuce and either mint or cilantro (can't remember which they use) in a softened rice paper wrapping). They are sooo yummy and relatively healthy. (Easy to make at home as well.)
