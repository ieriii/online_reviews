I die. I love this place and would fear for my savings if I lived anywhere near it. The drinks here are so freaking goooooooodddddd!!!! To top it off the presentation is ridiculous.... I was smiling the entire time I was here. We had their little cheese platter, which was some of the best cheese I've ever had....and all 3 drinks I got to try.... were delicious and all so different and special. if I go back I'll get the Romeo and Juliet again. MUST TRY!!!
