Would've loved to try some of the other offerings at this place, but my trip to Chicago was too short! After standing on line for more than 45 minutes, I finally placed my order for the ahodaga torta and churro with mexican vanilla soft serve on the side. It's so good to see something other than tacos at a restaurant which highlights Mexican flavors and cooking, and the sandwiches are truly unique. The ahodaga torta, which I figured would be the best to try since it is the only option they do not allow for take-out, was a medley of pork, black beans (which I couldn't find, maybe they were pureed? Couldn't taste them anyhow), and pickled onions sandwiched between a crusty bread that the angels must've made from God's tears, dough, and yeast. It is a contradiction - a delicious tragedy - that this sandwich sits in a shallow bowl of spicy tomato broth. I prefer my bread crusty (not soggy), but without the spicy kick, it just isn't "special." The churros were good... and TINY! No complaints though, I could use a few less calories during "dessert time," but I have to hand out some kind of imaginary award to the vanilla soft serve, which was hands down, the best I'd ever had. Perfect and strong vanilla flavor!
