Between the service and the food Davanti can't be beat. I LOVE THIS PLACE! It is perfect for sharing the mouth watering small plate dishes on the menu. Great for both dinner with friends and romantic dates. ONE WORD- RAVIOLO... get there early before it sells out. Don't miss the burrata and tomato salad. It will change your life. The pate is creamy and topped onto the grilled buttered toast makes my mouth water! The guys can't get enough of the rigatoni and I completely feel the same way. You'll also love that the wine is sold at retail (plus $7 corkage fee)- Talk about a bargain with the rediculous mark ups other restaurants charge these days. Venture down to Taylor Street and give it a try. You won't be disappointed (unless you are in a hurry- they don't take reservations and the wait is always long... but well worth it!)
