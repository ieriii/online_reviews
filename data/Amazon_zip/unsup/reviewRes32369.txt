My only gripe with this place is the price. $5 for edamame? The food ranged from so-so to excellent. The service, contrary to what others have said, was top notch on our visit. The sashimi we had was prepared well. The maki was maybe a little too saucy, otherwise good. A good dining experience, we'll definitely be back.
