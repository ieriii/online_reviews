My wife ate here Saturday night with some friends and ended up spending most of the night throwing up -- and all she had was the vegetarian sushi, not even the raw fish. She was too sick to work on Sunday and only went to work today because she had a meeting. I have called the health department. Needless to say, we will never go back and you shouldn't either.
