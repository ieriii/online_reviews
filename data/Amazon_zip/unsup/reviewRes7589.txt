We finally went to Fogo de Chao - and of all places while visiting in Chicago! BUT having said that, it was a really pleasant dining experience, even for a Saturday night.  The ONLY reason that this place did not get 5 stars was their slow service at the end of the meal in providing a check and because their "what appears to be mashed potatoes" was just yuck.  So, I love potatoes. I love them more than I should, and definitely more than I should eat. So when they provided the mashed potatoes, which appeared to be light and fluffy looking, I couldnt help myself. I know, I know. You pay $50 a person to eat meat and I'm eating some damn mashed potatoes. WELL, I couldn't help myself. Had to try.  And now I wish I hadn't. I had to ask them if the mashed potatoes were made from powder. Because it tasted like it was powdered, and then someone forgot to follow the directions and put more liquid in there than necessary. It was a watery, nasty, tasteless mashed potato. EW. So the server says, "I will get you something fresh." Ok I said.  Take two on the mashed potatoes. Slightly less watery...but honestly? I'd like to see them make it cuz it still tasted like it was out of a box! How hard is it to make buttery light mashed potatoes? Not so hard until I found a place that couldnt do it.  Aside from the mashed potatoes, the rest of the meal was good. OH-I can do without the mushy over cooked "bananas" too. WAY overcooked plantains in my opinion.  But hey, I'm no food critic. Just know how I like to eat.  As someone also mentioned, this is way superior to Texas de Brazil. I would go back on some given day I want to eat nothing but meat. But if you're not that hungry, and not in the mood for meat, you might want to try something else. For $50 a person, you can make palate budget stretch much further somewhere else.
