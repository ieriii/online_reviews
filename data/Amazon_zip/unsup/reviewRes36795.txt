Great curries, crispy noodles and though I don't eat seafood they seem to have an excellent selection of sushi. Their menu is extensive and the food is consistently good. It's just a touch pricey and I feel a little uncomfortable eating inside the place (I used to live a block away and take out was the best option) as the clientele can be a little uppity and the music is not always the best.
