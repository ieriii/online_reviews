not bad, not great, just not much worth remembering. Did enjoy my beer...was a guiness. The burger I consumed smelled and looked like food so that was a plus. The staff seemed happy or well medicated. The atmosphere though subtle and warm just felt more like a big waiting room...and so i waited and waited, but alas all that came was a thought...to leave. I may be back, most likely not, but hey should they be enticing enough for a cute tushy to saunter into this place...I may just have to follow;-)
