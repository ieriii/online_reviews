I waited about 1 1/2 hour for a table of 3 and was seated outdoor with a heated lamp. This is about 8:30pm and boy it was freezing out there (spring time dropped to 50 degrees! There was no other table available, so we were stuck in a communal table with two groups of patrons between us. I understand it's a busy night, but we rarely saw our waitress and cannot hold a conversation with friends without overhearing the patrons next to us. The food was very flavorful, but by the time it was placed on table for good minute, it was COLD b/c we were sitting outdoors! We ordered pig's ear, wagy beef, antipasto, smears, and that's all i could remember b/c I was freezing my butt off. We also had the meatball slider, which i was told by waiter that it's sharing portion, how can you cut a mini slider in half? Although the food is really good, but the service and ambiance can't cut it. For the price i pay, I rather be in a fancy restaurant with indoor seating and enjoy my meal sitting in my OWN table.
