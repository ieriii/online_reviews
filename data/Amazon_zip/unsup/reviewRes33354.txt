This place is pretty fantastic. Went on a Thursday night with another couple, the place was dead but who wants a packed restaurant? Anyways, the waiter and owner (also served us) were kind and attentive. Food was delicious, and the wine was more than adequate. 4 entres, 2 appetizers, and a bottle of wine was well under $200. For the quality, you can't beat that. The owner even offered us a free coffee or desert, though we declined. We'll definitely be back.
