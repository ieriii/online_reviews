Pros: It's fairly cheap for what you get, the bulgogi is tender and flavorful and they bring you tons of banchan. Cons: This is do-it-yourself BBQ and I mean really DIY since you have to cook it yourself. I've been to many Korean BBQ joints and they cut up the meat, put it on the grill, tend to it and take it off once it's done. This place just brings you a plate of raw meat and you're on your own. Also, while I do love the charcoal taste the coals provide, it gets really REALLY smoky and it sticks to your hair and clothes. The service is terrible. I came when the restaurant was almost empty and I still had to wait, and wait, and wait. They came and left so quickly from the table I didn't get a chance to ask them anything. No one asked me if I wanted a drink. They didn't even bring me the bill after the meal. I had to go to the cashier and ask for it. I went expecting bad service after reading the reviews here, but even so I was shocked at how much we were ignored. One of the worst things was that they ignored us so long at the end of our meal that our grill was just flaming with smokey, charred meat that stuck to the grill and when they finally removed it the flames wouldn't go out and the waitress dropped it on the floor and poured water on it and it made a huge mess! Well, it wouldn't have if they'd removed it after we were done grilling and didn't let it just sit there burning and burning. Yuck! I won't be going back. I don't know how they treat Koreans here, but if they are trying to discourage non-Koreans from coming here because of the language barrier (no English is spoken here) or just because they are not welcome they are doing a good job.
