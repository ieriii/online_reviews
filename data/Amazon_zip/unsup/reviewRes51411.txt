Oh, God. Oh... God. I think they put crack in these burritos because I go into immediate withdrawal once I've digested one. The food here is delicious - chicken and steak burritos (these babies are HUGE), guacamole, salsa, margaritas... I'm not sure why they have chocolate chip cheesecake, but I don't even care. The service is great, too. I often call in and pick up, and have never had to wait more than the 2-block walk or drive for my food to be ready. Price is unbeatable - $7 for a ginormous burrito that can seriously last 2 days. There's a reason this place is packed until 3am!
