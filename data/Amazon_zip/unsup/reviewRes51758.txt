Good gravy.... I am a very full, a little tipsy and every so satisfied! My friend John had his 29th birthday and we started the night here. We started at their small hidden bar in the back where we chatted until our table was ready and I had a chance to sample their margarita. On the rocks no salt... I was really looking forward to eating, why? I was hungry and this thing they called a margarita was getting my tipsy already. Was it phenomenal? No. Was it doing it's job? Yes. We sat down and his friends who I was sitting by come here quite often, suggested we get the guacamole for our side of the table, I agreed and threw in the nachos. The gauc was smooth and creamy, good, but not awesome, (I like mine a little chunky), the nachos, were again good, but not amazing and the salsa was really good, very fresh. Then I ordered the enchiladas verde, great portion size, very reasonable prices and tasty. I did see someone else get a burrito at the other end of the table.... for once I saw something that no matter how hungry I would ever be, could I even imagine eating the entire thing. The thing was beyond massive, yet looked like a worthy adversary to try and beat. All in all the prices were good, the place was busy, small and quaint, service was friendly and swift and I left just how I like to from a Mexican restaurant... full and tipsy with money still left in my pocket.
