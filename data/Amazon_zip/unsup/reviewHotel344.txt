I've stayed in this hotel on two separate occasions, and I dont really know why I decided to repeat my experience there. The first time was out of desperation when my friends and I were visiting from Texas and got kicked out of my friends' place where we were staying. This place was the cheapest we could find in downtown so we went for it. The second time I was just too lazy too really research. My own fault. The rooms are very basic, quite small, little to no amenities, etc. But you're paying what you do for the location - end of story. It's steps from Grant Park and the Red Line. But I recommend you spend a little extra money for a hotel with a decent standard of service and hospitality.
