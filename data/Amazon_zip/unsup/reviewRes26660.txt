Pequods is my favorite deep dish in the city. It's next to Webster Place Theater, so often a go-to before or after a movie. (In fact, that's girls' night this week!) It's a really big restaurant, with lots of TVs. It's roomy and lively. There is a main floor and upstairs. (I like the upstairs the best.) The deep dish is delicious. Yum. I love the sauce and the crust. I like getting extra sauce.
