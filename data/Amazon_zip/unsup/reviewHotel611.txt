Fresh Cookies Daily!!! I am surprisingly satisfied with the Double Tree... Yes, its an older hotel and its not the fanciest nor is it the cutest little boutique hotel, but its functional and clean. - Check in and Check out... done with ease - Fresh and warm cookies every day! (you just have to ask for them at the check in desk) - Comfy and clean bed - Clean Room - Crabtree & Evelyn Toiletries (One of my faves!) - About 4 short walking blocks to Michigan Avenue - Hotel towncar ($45 to airport), which was cheaper than the $55 flat cab rate - Super friendly staff. Always had smiles.
