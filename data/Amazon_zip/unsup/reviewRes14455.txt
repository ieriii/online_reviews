I am a big fan of the Cuban sandwich places. I personally love Marianao's steak sandwich more than the ones here. It is also more expensive than Mariano's, but this place makes up for that with a huge menu, a less hectic ordering experience, and more convenient hours of operation. The lechon was amazing here. The steak sandwich was also very good. I'd recommend anyone in the area to try the place out. You won't regret it. The experience will surely be a good one cause the owner is pretty friendly and really seems to care that everyone is happy with their food.
