Dear Texas De Brazil. Thank you for your amazing food, always. I've been here about 4 times now, previously having been to go Fogo a few times and Rio De Gado (in San Diego).. I'm a huge fan of brazilian churrascaria's as long as it's done right. We don't eat bacon and pork, and the guys here do a good job of remembering that which is appreciated.  It's $45 a person but Texas De Brazil ALWAYS has great coupons through e-mails so my advice is that if you think the price is a little steep, just sign up for their emails and you'll be sure to get a good deal soon. The salad bar here is great.. make sure to try the Lobster Bisque.. but remember not to get too full on the salad bar or the absurdly heavy bread they leave at your table... save space for the real stuff If you haven't been to a churrascaria, the servers here are really attentive and they're trained to be. Want filet mignon and haven't seen it go by, just mention it to someone and it'll be right over. Don't forget to try Guarana!
