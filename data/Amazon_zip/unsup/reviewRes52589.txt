Not sure if the churrascuria hype has died down a bit but I feel like the quality of the meats at this place reflects that perception. The meat seems saltier than ever (to cover for downgraded quality?). However, they seemed to have upped their game on the salad bar arena and service is still pretty decent. I didn't like how the waiter came around with a bottle of the after dinner shot and asked who wanted one. We were a big group and nobody knew that it was $8 a shot. This thing might be slightly better than limoncello but that's not saying a whole lot.
