I was always a pan girl until I tried Pequod's. They totally converted me to thin crust! Well for the most part, i do LOVE my stuffed pizza! I've had their thin crust pepperoni and thin crust spinach. Both were amazing! Generous with the pepperoni and cheese so there's no complaints here! For people who like onion rings, they're HUGE here! This is the only place where I'll actually eat Jalapeno poppers. Their cheese bread is great too! I lovepractically everything about this place. Only downside is that service can be slow and the pizza is good but a little greasy if that's something you care about. With pizza this good, I don't!! Just blot! ;)
