This is real authentic proper delicious Szechuan province style food. The service was decent but if you speak Mandarin it is better (just real basic knowledge here) but if you don't it is spotty that I could see. Food was perfect and proper would not change a thing. If you don't like the service here I get that and you can knock the place, if you knock them because you just learned chinese food is different than egg rolls and general tso's chicken from panda express I cannot take you seriously.
