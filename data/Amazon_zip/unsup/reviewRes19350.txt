Love coast. So accommodating and the food is great. The waitress even warned us that she had a huge party in addition to us and offered to reseat us. We told her we were not in a rush, and to take her time. She was still amazing. Love the BYOB and there are two stores right nearby to purchase. Great atmosphere.
