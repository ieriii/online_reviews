Way over-hyped. Cocktails are above average but nothing to wait FOR-EV-ER for. First they make you wait in line to get in, then they make you wait for a server to come over, then they make you wait even longer to make the drinks you ordered. If you want to pretend like you're on a TV show where everyone and everything is fabulous, you would probably like it. If you want fast service and good drinks at a reasonable price, skip it.
