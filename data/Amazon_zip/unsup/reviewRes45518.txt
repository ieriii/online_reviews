Its just so cozy inside! Who doesn't want to sit in Oscar Wilde's library, next to a roaring fire and drink red wine on a cold winter day? The beer list is impressive. Unfortunately, the food isn't great. It's not bad, just not great.  Fish n Chips - fish - good, chips - meh Mac & Cheese -- alright, that's actually pretty good.  Mashed potatoes? Icky. Wednesday - all beers are half priced. Score! The wine list is overpriced and fairly uninspiring - so if you're a wine drinker, stick to Tuesday's half priced night to take some of the sting away.
