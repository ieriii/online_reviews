The location is nice and I love the interior and their system for waitlisting people as well as the "waiting room." It's all convenient and nice, but the food... eh. I had the orange bread french toast. It was way too sweet for starters and tasted, i kid you not, exactly like an Entenmann's Pound Cake, agh. I was sick of it less than a quarter into the meal. Everyone else's breakfasts were nice looking as was mine but pretty mediocre. Maybe next time (if there is a next time) I'll go for a crepe or sandwich. ALSO!!!... If it's rainy out, DO NOT sit by the window. My sister was in town when we went and we were sat by the window. the weather was really erratic, and it was pouring one hour, then okay the next. When we were seated it was fine, but then it began REALLY POURING again, and what do you know... there's a leak in the window. It wasn't just a tiny leak. It was huge, and every drop would land on the table and turn into 20 drops ricocheting off the table and all over our food. Needless to say, my coffee was no good, and I was at least done with my meal. The waitress was really nice and service was fine, but the food and overall experience just can not be praised. Nothing but the service and the way the place was run was worth raving about.
