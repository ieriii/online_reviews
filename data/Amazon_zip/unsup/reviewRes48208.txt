I was impressed with the overall experience at the Publican. A great place for a dinner date or a group of friends. Family style seating, all the pork dishes you can think of and the wait staff that will guide you along the way. A great beer list which overwhelmed me at first but the selections can cater to anyone's palate. We sampled the aged hams. They were all fantastic including the la quercia rossa which was my favorite. A bit salty to share for two so I would recommend ordering if for a larger group. I was a bit disappointed they were out of the spicy pork rinds and blood sausage at the time. We ended up with the fried oysters which were gobbled up in minutes. The fried green tomatoes were a nice compliment and the sauce to go with them was fantastic. And we decided the aged ham and oysters were not enough so frites with the fried eggs were very savory. But the eggs were a bit over done so fries weren't able to take a bath in the yolks. A trip back is definitely in order to try a few more dishes that were not available at the time.
