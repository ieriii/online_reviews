Quite simply the best dining experience I've ever had -- from the inventive design of the entrance all the way to the final course of the meal. The food is on par with Tru, but the innovation in both the dishes and their presentation is unparalleled. There was a fun surprise through every step of the 12 course meal, and the wine pairing was phenomenal. All of this without the level of pretension you find at Trotter's or Tru. It's priced accordingly, of course, so you'll want to observe the experience for special occasions! Enjoy -- Alinea will NOT disappoint!
