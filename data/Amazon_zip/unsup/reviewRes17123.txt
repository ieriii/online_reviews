We went for dinner for a birthday. I ordered my girlfriend and I the platter for two just because I wanted to embarass her. I looked up at our server, batted my eyes and said "I'll have what she's having." And then she hit me. I think our server was so distracted by my act that he screwed up everyone else's order because the rest of our friends only recieved partial orders, no orders, or different orders. Almost everyone had ordered an extra side of nan, but only one basket (not including the pre-dinner basket) was brought out. And this was for eight of us. Maybe it's because it was a Tuesday, or maybe it's because we were a large party, but the service, while cordial, was a little inefficient. I'll be the jerk that votes "No" for "Good for Groups," though it looks like I'm not the only one that has problems with service. Though, at the very least, kudos to the staff for handling our messed up credit-card/cash mixture though. The food itself was pretty standard fare, though nothing blew me out of the water. The tandoori didn't really taste like tandoori, though. It tasted more like Harold's chicken caked in red coloring and curry power. Eh. Also the rice pudding was runny (thought I've been corrected on this account, that Kheer is supposed to be runny. Thank you, Mindy). But everything else we had was pretty darn good. They DO make a good martini though. My Beefeater martini was mixed very well, and everyone else's house speciality martinis were tasty as all heck. All in all, their Ft. Lauderdale, FL location is much better. And since Ft. Lauderdale is, you know, almost 2,000 miles away, you're better off heading to Devon and eating at one of the many restaurants around there.
