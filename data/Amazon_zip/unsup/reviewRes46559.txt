The burgers are pretty good. I mainly come here for the bloody margaritas and breakfast brunch, as it's a quick block from my place. The story and inside are neat. It's the first LEYE and salad bar. The menu is pretty standard American which can be a bit boring. Every time I get my tab I feel like I'm paying about $5 more than it's worth. Kind of like CVS if you don't have the CVS card.
