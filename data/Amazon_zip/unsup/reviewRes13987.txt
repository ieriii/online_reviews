Great seafood and decent prices. Haven't been here in a few years but have noted the portion sizes seem to have shrinked a tad. I've pretty much had every fish on the blackboard and never have gone wrong. Had a delicious Sturgeon today. And love the crabcake benedict for brunch. I just wonder why they even have all that stupid cereal and the menu. Why not just stick to the fish on the blackboard. Came with my 2yo tonight and were 4 other kids in. Maybe get a kids menu?
