A-OK, as Yelp calls the 3-star review, is just about right. The seating/ordering situation is.. well, weird.  You walk in the door and see a deli-style counter and think "oh, ok, well I'll just get in line, order, and then find a seat". Not so fast mister. After a good 10-15 minute wait (this was at 2pm on a Friday) we were finally next in line at the counter, when the cashier told us that unless the hostess had given us a number we couldn't order.  So we had to wait for people to leave before we got a number.. after another 5 minutes or so we got a number and were allowed to order. I had the hibiscus & lemongrass agua fresca, which was quite good but lacking in the lemongrass department. My torta was good I suppose.. quite salty, but not overly so.. it was just lacking any real flavor. It was the Milanesa and had really nothing going for it.. The bun was good, the fried chicken was good, but, well.. that pretty much describes the sandwich. Imagine a thin battered and fried piece of white meat chicken on a bun. Meh. I'll try something different next time.
