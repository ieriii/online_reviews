I have a feeling that I was one of their first customers. When this little cafe opened, we forced our way in to try some crepes before the crowds. I had heard that the owners had opened the Crepe and Coffee Palace, which had good reviews but I had never ventured to that location. My mother got a greek crepe, and myself a 'chicago' crepe. Though originally we were going to share, I remember us both liking our own choices, and sticking to them. Their soup served was luke-warm, but I gather they were eager and nervous to serve us. We finised with what was supposed to be a chocolate crepe and ice cream, but had bananas in it too. I liked it a lot, but my mother hates nanas, so she skipped it. I've never gone back, but I pass it daily on my way home from work. It's usually packed and I give a mini thumbs-up in my brain each time I see them busy. I will be getting my butt back there as soon as I stop eating everything else that I see.
