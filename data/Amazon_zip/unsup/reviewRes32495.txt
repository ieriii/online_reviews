This may be the best cooked vegan food in the city. It has been around since 1983, so they know what they are doing. I tried the Radical Reuben, which was outstanding. Everything they have is presented so well, and very colorful with all the fresh ingredients, and in huge portions. There is nice outdoor seating, and the indoor diner is cool, very retro. The wait staff is extremely friendly, and the cooks are super fast. I was there for a late lunch at 2 in the afternoon and the food was ready in about 5 minutes. They have a great selection of local craft beers from the region, as well as wines and cocktails. The location is in a nice area of the city, very scenic. This is a new favorite, definitely a place to take friends when they visit the city.
