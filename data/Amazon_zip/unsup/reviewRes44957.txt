Had a deep dish pizza with veggies. Very good. Love the tomato sauce and the generous amount of veggies. The waitress very good and we were able to watch Sunday football during our lunch. Make sure you have lots of time for your meal, a deep dish pizza takes an average of 35-40 minutes to be cooked.
