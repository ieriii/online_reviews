Picked Graham Elliott due to his a) reputation, b) personality and c) reviews. Atmosphere was fun, borderline playful and menu was intriguing. We had the BBGun (hubby) and Pillow Talk (me) cocktails to start. The bartenders were incredibly knowledgeable and engaging in the process of making their mixtures. After being seated, we devoured the "amuse bouche" popcorn. For dinner, we had the tasting menu: deconstructed Caesar (brioche twinkie not to be missed), butternut bisque (best dish of the night - really!), sea scallop, waygu beef and then indoor s'mores.  Service was attentive, food was outstanding. A memorable night for a great anniversary.
