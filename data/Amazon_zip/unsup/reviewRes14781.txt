Some friends and I went to Revolution on a Friday night around 5:15. We were planning on just drinking and eating some appetizers. When we told the hostesses that, they told us that we should just drink in the waiting area. At that point, we told them that we would just order some food. We got the mussels and potato cakes, which were both good, and ordered a few rounds of drinks. But we didn't stay that long because we felt like the entire staff was trying to get us to leave. Our bill came to $75 for three people. But I guess that Revolution thinks that's not enough money for the use of a table. Too bad. I really wanted to like this place.
