Ate here last week with a friend. Really great food, outstanding bone marrow and must-try beet and goat cheese app. Pricey and crowded. Wait too long for the hype. What earns it four stars is the extensive wine list and the excellent waiter, who talked us through the menu, was patient, kind and helpful. Would come back again with a large group- would be less pricey to split between more people. But probably more of a wait...
