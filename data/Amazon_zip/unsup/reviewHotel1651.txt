This was our home base while in Chicago and the entire hotel was up to excellent Kimpton standards. Yes, it's an older building but our room was spacious enough for two and we never heard a peep from other guests. We were right next to the elevator and the housekeeping closet which resulted in some morning noise during peak cleaning times but obviously it didn't bother us too much as we managed to loiter in bed one morning until 10 am. Speaking of which, nice beds! I'm picky about those and slept wonderfully without any back or neck aches. The hotel staff was exceptional with great recommendations and advice and we enjoyed the adjoining Liquid Lounge. After walking up Michigan Ave one afternoon I'm so glad we opted to stay here instead of on the Magnificent Mile - navigating the crowds there would have driven me batty! The neighborhood is relatively quiet, clean, safe and had all the amenities (drugstores, local eateries) we needed. Clark/Lake blue line is a short walk for airport transport, and we walked to Millennium Park, Magnificent Mile, and Willis Tower from the hotel. Small downside: no in-room coffee makers but we didn't mind hopping down to the lobby in the mornings to get our fix. I particularly love the pet friendliness of Kimpton hotels - I rarely travel with my dog but being able to greet the traveling pooches while I'm away from home makes me happy.
