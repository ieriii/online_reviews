After visiting Costa Rica a couple summers ago, I've been longing for Costa Rican food ever since. Finding Irazu was an answer to my prayers. I can get authentic Costa Rican food without having to make the trip back to the country (not that I would complain about that!) you can't find Costa Rican food anywhere else in Chicago. The Casado was my immediate choice from the menu as it is one of the traditional dishes offered in Costa Rica. AMAZING!You get a plethora of meat, rice an bean mixture, plaintains, and i cant remember if it was a salad or something else but you definitely get more than your moneys worth. The steak is out of this world.
