here's the 1000th review for carnivale, took some out of town friends here at the suggestion of a homie. they were looking for casual fine dining with booze and lots of meat options. i see this place all the time on my way home, so i figured i might as well give it a shot. carnivale fit the bill very nicely.  though the space is huge, we were seated in a more intimate, quieter section of the restaurant. this was awesome until the real desperate housewives of cook county were seated next to us. our waiter was nice, though a bit too informative--i like my information in pithy nuggets--and i didn't particularly enjoy his demeanor. i had a problem with his usage of the collective pronoun "we"; i understand this is a personal quirk, so i won't hold it against him. he was perfectly sufficient. the fish tacos (i am obsessed with fish tacos) were pretty tasty, and my entree--skirt steak, rice and beans--was very flavorful. the dessert, the chocolate cake with "chocolate lava" in the middle, would make you smack your mama.  overall a painless dining experience. and i wore jeans and sneakers. that's what's up!
