I've read the other reviews (thanks Yelp) and just had to go and check it our for myself, so my wife and I went for Valentine's day and we both loved it!First of all I am glad I made reservations for 7p- it was packed at 7:30 and a line was out the door.If you do not mind eating with your hands, enjoy spicy (think Indian) food, and have an open mind when it comes to table settings, then I think you may enjoy Demera.First off there are two types of tables here: the normal table that you will find at any other restaurant as well as the traditional Ethiopian tables and chairs that look like something you would find in a hookah lounge. They are low to the ground, informal and dare I say it- fun.We were seated in the traditional setting with the low table for drinks etc, and the second hand woven table in which the food was placed on a LARGE round plate, the food is eaten with your hands by picking up with pieces of bread that resemble a large thin pancake. I know it sounds odd and it was but it was also fun! And it made for a great date. Be sure to check out their web page as there are pictures of this. I think all we talked about the entire time we were there was how good the food was- oh and the beer! You have to have the beer...very very good and it complimented the spicy food.Living in Uptown I enjoy having another choice besides Chinese or pizza. Check out Demera, it's not very expensive, it's a unique night out and you'll have lots to talk about.
