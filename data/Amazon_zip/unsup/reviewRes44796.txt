There's nothing I can add about the food others wrote in previous reviews, so I'll add just a few quick comments. The pizza is truly excellent as everyone rants, but delivery just isn't the same as eating there. I live two blocks away (I admit...I'm lazy), and the delivered pizza is always much cooler than the dine-in version. Do NOT put the box with pizza into a fridge. The cheese will stick to the box, and you'll have a nice thin layer of cardboard on the bottom of your slices when you pull them off the next morning. (aluminum foil works wonders) Be careful when ordering anything fried and having it delivered, especially the Combination Platter (horribly overpriced for what it is) or Zucchini Fritters. The breading will get mushy during the delivery, however, when I dine-in, fried stuff is always fine. Their salads are so-so. Some people may love the variety, but I think there's not much difference between them; an extra ingredient here, a few there. Is it a Chicago thing that restaurants can't cut up big pieces of veggies in salads during processing? I'm not writing that all salads should be minced like a Cobb salad, but Giordano's salads are always big slices of whatever. I think their salads are the best value food on the menu. They're generous, and none above $7 (for now). DO NOT order the Tiramisu for delivery. Just don't. You think mushy breaded veggies are a problem with delivery orders? Oh, wait until you see what happens to desserts. But you already know that Tiramisu is better enjoyed at a restaurant, right?
