AMAZING! This was my second time at XOCO and it was even better than the first. I ordered the Ahoghada which was unbelievable. It is a sandwich that comes half dipped in a spicy broth. You could also pick if you wanted the broth mild, medium, or hot which I found very nice. I chose mild and it still had a great kick! Throughout the meal, my sandwich soaked up all of the amazing broth and it it only got better. We went on a weekday night around 4:45 and there was no wait and we found seating for a group of five of us. My friend had the red chile soup and said it was delicious and ate every drop. I highly recommend Xoco and the Ahoghada sandwich! P.S The first time I are here, I ordered the choriqueso which was also delicious! P.P.S I was star struck when I saw Rick Bayless wandering around the restaurant!
