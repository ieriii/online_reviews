After signing up for their e-mail newsletter, my friends and I had become monthly visitors to Texas de Brazil...especially for their summer specials when they offer Mon-Thurs dinner for half price! I can definitely get my money's worth then. I've had "struggling vegetarian" friends rave about the meat here. The salad bar is so fresh and offers a wide-variety of things to choose from including, my favorite, the Lobster Bisque. When it comes to choosing a location though, if you can, I would suggest the Schaumburg location. I feel that the Chicago location is almost TOO expansive that it takes longer for the gauchos to come to you. I also had to wait a much longer time to get the type of meat that I was looking for. However, Chicago does have their "wine angels." When it comes to finding a steakhouse, I'd much rather spend my money on Texas de Brazil. In order to get GOOD steak at a steakhouse you're going to spend as much as you would, if you get a half off dinner offer at TdB! So, you might as well make it all you can eat!
