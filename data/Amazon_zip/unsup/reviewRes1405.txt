GREATEST encased meats you will EVER eat. Went on Monday and the line was just out the door. Wait was still about 30 minutes but well worth it! I always let my bf order b/c he's the greatest. He ordered us a Beer and Cheddar Cheese Bison Sausage with Dark Beer Mustard and Horseradish Cheddar Cheese and a cognac infused lamb sausage with manchego cheese. We also split a corn dog (b/c the man loves 'em) and fries. Delicisousness!! HEAVEN!
