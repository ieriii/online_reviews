Anytime I'm in the South Loop, I heard over to Bongo Room for a filling breakfast.  I love their selection of amazing pancakes, breakfast burritos, waffles and egg.  The portions are typical Chicago style (more than plenty).  I definitely recommend the chocolate banana french toast.  Weekends are super busy so expect a wait. Weekdays are the best times to go!
