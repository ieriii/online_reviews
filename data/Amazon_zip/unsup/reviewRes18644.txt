pretty darn good tortas....crusty bread, garlicky, slow marinated meat and a heavy dose of cilantro...hard to imagine a better combo of ingredients. The churros are some of the best I've ever had. decent selection of beers to accompany the grub as well. Since it's a more affordable Bayless spot, it is super busy and can take a while to eat. Be patient.
