I wasn't that impressed. I would much rather go to Gaylords. The buffet was 14.95 which is the most expensive I have ever seen. One plus is that they do bring the sizzling tandoori chicken to the table. The food was very average, nothing in the buffet that would make you go back for 15 dollars a person.
