Great little spot tucked away off the main drag on Michigan St. We managed to get a table for two outside on a nice Saturday evening. The chairs were especially comfortable (padded), not the cheapo poolside plastic specials you get at some alfresco spots in town. We enjoyed the pig's ears, especially with the kale. We also had the Greek sausages, bone marrow and tuna & beans. Some commenters have said the food is a bit oily and salty, and yeah, you'll have that with fried pig parts. But not all items were that way (not that I minded), just stay away from the fried section.
