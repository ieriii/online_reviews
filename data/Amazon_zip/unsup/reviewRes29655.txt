I have to say I love the pasta bowl, and honestly a small part of it is due to the adorable little oven delivery truck I used to see all over my old hood. But it's also a great place for affordable solid italian. The service is always friendly and quick. My first visit here was probably my favorite. I was with my boyfriend at the time and we were were like the only people in the place as it was like 2 below outside and 9m on a weeknight. All of a sudden 3 girls practically in bathing suits came to the table offering us free Bud Light limes it was priceless! I can only assume they wandered from next door but either way it was hilarious. As far as what to get I would highly recommend the Gnocchi Aurora. Regular and spinach gnocchi with tomato cream sauce, fresh spinach, and chicken covered in smoky mozzarella yumminess and baked. It was perfect for last sunday when I was cold, starving, and a bit hung over. They also have really good thin crust pizza and salads. Pay them a visit soon, and you will find yourself with a table full of delicious, fresh, affordable Italian fare. And maybe, just maybe you will be lucky enough to be paid a visit by a gaggle of scantily clad women with free booze in tow.
