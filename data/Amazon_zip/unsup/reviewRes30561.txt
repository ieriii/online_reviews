If you are a fan of Asian fusion - Sunda is a must when visiting Chicago! They have a variety of very unique and creative dishes in a tapas style, with hints of flavor from Japan, Thai, Vietnamese, French, and Californian. Recommend going with a larger group so that you can have the chance to sample a larger variety of menu items.
