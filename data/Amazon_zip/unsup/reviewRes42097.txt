We came. We ate. We conquered. That was at least the feeling we all had after leaving with full belly and tipsy minds. Aside from the enormous bone in rib eyes, perfectly balanced radish/brussle sprout salad and the can't miss $4 table wine, the bone marrow appetizer stole the show. Five overly generous portions that would make the Flintstones wonder what happened to their beloved Dino, presented with a delicate red onion jam and Sriacha, that's right Sriacha, make the trip (and the wait) totally worthwhile. The waiter talked us into some "pickle-back" shots which are terrifying to look at, and worse to read the contents, but once you throw one back, its not long before the next round is on its way back to the table. It's no secret Gilt bar has serious foodie and cocktail-connoisseur appeal, and I'm happy to hop on board both trains.
