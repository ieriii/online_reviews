Maybe it was a bad night because reviews are generally positive for this place, but I just didn't think the food was that great. Also, I'm an early 30-something, and gone are the days of me sitting at a community table like my 4th grade school cafeteria. Fortunately, we had one of those cool booths with the doors (which are, indeed, cool!) but I would not have been a happy camper had I been asked to sit down and share a conversation with a random somebody. The beer list is interesting and comprenhensive, although the wines not so much. What I didn't like: duck hearts (acquired taste, perhaps, but they were very tough and salty), striped bass (extremely fishy), suckling pig (tough meat and devoid of flavor). What I did like: brussels sprouts (shredded, seasoned nicely, and creme fraiche on anything makes it good), frites (fried...need I say more?), fennel gratin (flavorful but a bit on the heavy side). This place had so much hype and I'm not sure why. I guess that plays a big part into my 2 star rating. Put another way, if somebody were coming to Chicago and said they had reservations at Publican, I would steer them in another direction. If I were going out with a big group, and somebody made a reservation at Publican, I'd be a team player and go along with it instead of muddying the waters. But no way am I going to voluntarily return...I have had far better meals in the city.
