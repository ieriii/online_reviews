Just had dinner at Schwa last night. Price is up to $105 for 9 courses now. Food is comtemporary American done very well. If you're a self proclaimed foodie, wondering how Chefs rejunvenate old pairings or come up with new food compositions. Then this is your restaurant.  Store front looks like a hole in the wall. But when you step in, it's an understated, elegant room. Service is minimal but adequate. And I appreciate discussing each course with my server. The kitchen staff bring you your food, expains all the ingredients to you and takes care of giving you new forks and knives after each course. I personally don't care about stemware. They do give you a new glass each time you pop a new bottle.  Outstanding courses: Chestnut soup, quail egg ravioli, the rabbit, tumeric ice cream. Some courses came out on plates like paintings on canvas.  A few misses too: the risotto as cheese course, the beet juice at the beginning. Nothing special. I went to Alinea before everybody got googoo gaagaa over it. I believe Michael Carlson's Schwa will become the same phenomenon.
