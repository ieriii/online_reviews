I went here for a friend's birthday and was not so impressed.  For a Cuban restaurant, you would think that Mojitos would be pretty decent. However, they tasted more like grapefruit and water than an actual drink. The service was slow and not really friendly. Granted it was a Saturday night, but they seemed to not be in much of a rush to please. The food was pretty good. I had the Pistachio Encrusted Chicken.  The waitress didn't really present any sort of dessert suggestions or enticements. She sort of just set down a copy of the dessert menu and left. If it weren't for the friends I had with me, I think I would have rated it lower.
