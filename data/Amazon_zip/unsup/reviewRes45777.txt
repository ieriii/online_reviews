The food is just ok, but there's plenty of it. The place is huge and has a great decor. If you ever have to wait, it could be miserable because they don't have a waiting area to speak of. I guess they want you to go to the bar. Very friendly service. So go here for the atmosphere and don't expect anything stellar from the food.
