I have visited Anteprima several times with a Milanese friend living in Andersonville. We were disappointed every time. Yes, the menu is authentic and the pricing fair. However, the service -- or lack thereof -- is enough for us to have sworn off returning. Excellent service can elevate a meal to new levels.  At the same time, poor service can ruin the experience entirely. I'm sorry to say... the later is the rule at Anteprima. And hey... I gave it three tries.The food is tasty and well prepared. But it is far from fabulous and nowhere near Chicago's best Italian cuisine. The ambiance is average, although outdoor dining in the summer is worth the trip at least once. Inside, however, dinner chat is overrun by a reverberating din.If you are looking for reasonably-priced Italian food that reflects a genuine Italian pallet, you will probably enjoy Anteprima. But if you are looking for a more discerning experience complemented by attentive, knowledgeable service, look elsewhere... for example Coco Pazzo or, better yet, Merlot.
