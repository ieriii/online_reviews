I visited Revolution Brewing Co. from San Diego, and loved everything about it. So much so that I bought a t-shirt about it. I had the house pretzel and the tempeh rueben with french fries. The pretzel was the best I've ever had, and the cheese ale soup dipping cup it comes with is amazing. The sandwich was also great, and huge, I could only finish half. The fries were top notch, but I also had a couple bites of the blue cheese potato salad, and that was great too - don't know which I would choose next time. I was glad to see plenty of vegetarian options on the menu. I drank the Bottoms Up Wit, and it was as good as a wit gets. It just might be my favorite wit. If I lived in Chicago, I would live at Revolution Brewing.
