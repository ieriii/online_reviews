Maybe I'm just jaded by the incredible seafood and Asian restaurants in San Francisco, but this place was totally just meh. We ordered all of the top recommendations on Yelp, and they were all sub par. The best dish we had was the brussel sprout salad. We tried the beef lollipops -- overcooked. Several of the sushi dishes -- not impressed. Yelp has led me astray!
