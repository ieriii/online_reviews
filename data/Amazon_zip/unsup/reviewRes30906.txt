Food was good not great. It's Asian-fusion so don't expect Asian food because it tastes like Rachel Ray cooking Asian food - mind you she's a great cook. The place is great for friends to hang out and have cocktails and dinner but DO NOT go here for a DATE. It's too damn loud so good luck trying to "get to know" your date lol. Good luck finding parking in the area so be sure you have some cash for the valet. I think it was $12 (don't forget to tip cheapos). Dress nice because this is River North. If you don't, you will stand out like a sore thumb and Real Housewives wannabes will give you a dirty look. (I have a good friend who dresses like a "lady of the night" meet me for dinner and I didn't appreciate the looks she got, but I'm use to it). Overall, good but not great :)
