Trip to chicago was a little rough, but eve's. Giordiano's was the only pizza place I found even remotely worthwhile in that joke of a downtown Chicago has, but I'm sure there are others given proper research. Deep Dish was pretty sweet. We went back for 2nd's on another night because I refused to eat at a damn wendy's which was all we could find. And we walked for a damn hour.
