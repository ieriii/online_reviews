My daughter and I had the pleasure of dining here tonight. We each started with the beet soup and it was simply outstanding. She had the skirt steak and I the pork schnitzel. We tried each others dinners and agreed that they were both very, very good. The desserts were absolutely perfect after the fabulous meal and we decided that we will definitely be back, The staff made us feel very welcome and at home. They were professional and friendly. A bit of a ride for us but well worth the drive on all counts.
