The food was only ok. The service was terrible. There is no reason my party of six should have been there for 2 hours. Yes, it was a Saturday, and yes it was 7:30, but there was no wait. I don't think there was a wait the whole time I was there, so we should have been in and out in about an hour. The "pommes frites" looked like they were purchased at Jewel and served with Dijon mustard and feta cheese. Good, but not worth the almost $4. I will probably not return.
