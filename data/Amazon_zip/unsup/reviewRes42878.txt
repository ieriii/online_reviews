salad: thinly sliced fennel and granny smith apples, cheese, and a tangy/sweet vinegarette. outstanding. i've never had a salad so crisp and refreshing, all while being so devoid of any color. pork belly: perfectly crisp, not too fatty (or maybe i didnt care), salty, and with asparagus and some type of grain. a fruit glaze on top makes the dish a little sweet. paired perfectly with... wine: grenache/syrah blend, old world, earthy. love it. cornbread: a pan grilled cornbread made from white corn with scallions and lots of butter and salt. absolutely fantastic. cocktail: an aviation, an off-menu gin cocktail with lemon, maraschino, and a couple other things i can't remember. strained, cold, perfect. decor: dark, warm crowd: young, hip, gastropubby love. this. place.
