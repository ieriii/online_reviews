This place has awesome food! Their temperature soup is a really cool concept too (you only pay the temperature it is outside so if it's 60 degrees you'd pay 60 cents). Their potato soup is exceptionally good. It's a cool place, especially if you get a booth or get in when it's not super crowded. My only complaint is the way the floor seating is set up. The one time I was there we were seated exceptionally close to this really irritating yuppie family. They kept letting their kid run around all over the place like a wild animal while we were trying to eat. The tables were so close there wasn't anything I could do about the kid full out running into me. It was very rude, but I can't blame it on the restaurant just on bad parenting (or rather lack of any parenting). That's the reason I think they should maybe take out one table and space the rest out better. But other than that it's a very cool place with really good food. I suggest trying the buffalo chicken nachos, they're very unique.
