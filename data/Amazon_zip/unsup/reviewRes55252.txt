This place has not let me down.....Ive bin here 6 total times and every time i have left extremely happy....I came here the other day with my cousin Jimmy and to my surprise during lunch the price is cut in half to 25 bucks a person....I can't stress enough how well seasoned there meat is and the salad bar is insane! I LOVE THIS PLACE!
