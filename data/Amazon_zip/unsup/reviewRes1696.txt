I am sure, when (yes, when) I go here again, I'll give it another star. I found the exact right time to go where there were only two people (TWO!) in front of us in line. And I'm not telling ya'll what day or time that is. I had the Elvis (polish sausage) with sauerkraut and a cheese fry. It was quite tasty - the sourkrauty is a little...pickley tasting - more sour than sweet, but I really liked it. And the fries are pretty high quality. My dining companion had a Bratwurst and she was quite thrilled with it.  Yum.
