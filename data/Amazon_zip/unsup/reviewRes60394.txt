I always order Giordano's pizza.One of the best deep dish pizzas here in Chicago. The sauce is amazing with all the different spices. I always order stuffed spinach and it is amazing. They always deliver on time. They have a great dinning area. They can make pretty much any toppings for your pizza. The crust of the pizza is strong it does not fall apart when you pick it up. There are many locations all around the Chicago area.
