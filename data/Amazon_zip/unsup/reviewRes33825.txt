I absolutely love this place but what is with the cashiers? Are you too cool to take my money? I don't need or want you to be my friend but you could at least look me in the eye as you ring me up. They seem to have something better to do all the time, whether it is talk to someone on the phone or someone else behind the counter, walk outside to check on something while I stand there with my money in hand ready to give it up. The only other "beef" I have with this place is the chicken. It is a bit on the grisly side. Oh yeah and now that I think of it the chick pea soup is either out of this world great one day or it is watered down beyond belief. Still...someone along the line (the cashiers Mom) created these great dishes for Chicago to enjoy. Thanks cashiers' Mom!
