Is this the best Brazilian steakhouse I have been to? It sure is and I will definitely go back - unlike Brazzaz this place has better tasting food and a great salad bar. I went with my GF for another anniversary dinner and the experience was great. She loved the variety of cheeses and options at the salad bar and I loved the well seasoned meats and good service. This place is definitely worth the money and keep an eye out for 50% offers if you sign up for their mailing list.
