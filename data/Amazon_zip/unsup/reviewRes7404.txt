this place is unique because its a nice, reservation bbq place. so i mean, the food is good...but youre there for the scene, not the bbq. the service was good except they were a little TOO attentive (checking every 3 min) which was irritating but better safe than sorry. good place for groups and the atmosphere is cool. worth checking out.
