While watching the de la hoya vs. mayorga fight in a sports bar earlier this year, I met a nice Mexican guy from LA. The conversation eventually drifted towards food at which time I asked him if there was any good Mexican food in Chicago (after being disappointed on numerous occasions). Without hesitation he recommended Nuevo Leon, saying he liked it even more than the LA Mexican food he had grown up around. This impressed me tremendously, as I had recently tried (thoroughly enjoyed) Mexican food in LA.  Long story short, I went to Nuevo Leon the very next day, and had an awesome, and budget-friendly meal. The atmosphere is really cool, and a nice journey away from the Chicago I've come to know. There's lots of dishes I have yet to sample, and will look forward to trying out over time.
