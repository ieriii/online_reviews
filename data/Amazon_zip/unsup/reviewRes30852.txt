Love me some Nana's. The cutest breakfast/lunch/brunch spot in Bridgeport. And.... ORGANIC & vegetarian friendly! The restaurant has a clean, simple, hip, & sunny face to it. Fresh ingredients & flavors that mirror an upscale american menu along with mexican brunch savories. Middle of the road, price wise. I would say that most people come for brunch/lunch but they do serve a full dinner menu. I'm only really in the area during the day but I'd bet Nana's wouldn't disappoint for dinner. A few girlfriends and I love to come here and chat away. I've enjoyed the... chilaquiles huevos rancheros stuffed french toast mushroom & grilled cheese sandwich hand cut chips & truffle cheese dip grilled cheese wheat berry salad So much more I need to try! Cute breakfast date spot. Nice place to play "meet the parents." Perfect, "break the bad day" lunch hideout. I've seen children in there a few times but it's more of an adult place. Daily menu items range around $9-$14 or so. The owner is a friendly guy. Servers are too. I go on weekdays to get away from the hustle and bustle of the city and the B.S. I have to deal with during the workday. Always brightens the day.
