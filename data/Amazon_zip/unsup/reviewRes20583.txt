if could judge this place based on their churros & hot chocolate alone it would be 5+ but as a venue it's not that great. it's long & narrow and first timers have NO idea where to stand to order, how put your name on the waiting list, how long the wait is, where to get take out, or where to stand while waiting for take out or waiting for a table. it's just too small & the counter(s?) are in weird places. but the churros! get more than one! and split a spicy hot chocolate with a friend. it is like drinking a delicious melted candy bar but it's too rich to enjoy an entire cup on your own. would go back and stand in awkward places for churros & chocolate again.
