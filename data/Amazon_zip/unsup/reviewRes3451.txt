I finally went to Crisp after telling my friend about it over a month ago (she's been in 4 times to my 1 time). I had the Seoul Sassy wings which were great! They weren't too sweet and had just the right amount of crispiness to them. I tried one of the BBQ wings that my friend got, and they were ok, but not for me. I prefer the sweetness of the Sassy wings. The prices were affordable (the owner told us to buy 10 wings all together for $11.95, which saved each of us $1 each) and the wings were large, but you could definitely finish all five, shoot I know I did. Definitely a great end to a day. (or middle)
