I've eaten a lot of steaks and seafood and Wildfire is middle of the road. I ate here with a pre-selected dinner menu featuring appetizers, entrees, and dessert. I tried a little bit of everything and nothing really struck me as "gotta have it". The atmosphere is actually pretty great and I did enjoy our servers. However, I can get atomosphere and good service most places. If one is paying this much money for food it better be pretty good. In this case it was just run-of-the-mill.
