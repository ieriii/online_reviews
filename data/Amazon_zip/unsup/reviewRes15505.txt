Went to Revolution for the first time the other day. I was pleased with it! Went on a Thursday night-very crowded. I was craving a burger and I was very satisfied with juiciness and a lot of taste. I split it with my amiga and half was plenty. Mashed potatoes were Yum-my! I am a big fry girl and I got a side, but they were not anything impressive. Beer YUM. And the only thing I can advise is not to go their on a first date! A fun atmosphere to go with friends!
