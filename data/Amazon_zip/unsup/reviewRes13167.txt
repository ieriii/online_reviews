I've been reading the reviews for this place, and I wanted to check it out. I went on a Saturday afternoon at 2 and it was rather packed. My friends and I were given a 30 minute wait, so we went down to Scot's for a drink (which was a great idea, by the way). When we came back, we wanted to order off of the blackboards, but we were disappointed that we were told we couldn't unless we wanted to wait around until 3--that miffed me a bit. "Never mind, we'll do the brunch." And it was pretty damn good brunch! I had this smoked trout hash, which was absolutely delectable. My other friends had a shrimp New Orleans dish, which was very good, and some banana pancakes. The food was fan-freaking-tastic. While our waitress was kind and knowledgeable, she was a little inattentive because she was just so busy. Normally that would frustrate me, but the food more than made up for it.
