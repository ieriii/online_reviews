I love Superdawg! Another great place to get a good Chicago-style hot dog. They stick to the traditional combination, although they provide ketchup now which is somewhat upsetting. The drive-in set-up is also fun. I don't really go that often because it's more expensive than Gene & Jude's and somewhat overpriced, but I love it nonetheless.
