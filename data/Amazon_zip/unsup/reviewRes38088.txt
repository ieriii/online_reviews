Easily one of the best bars in the city for those interested in challenging their beer palettes and who also may be looking for good barfood. The big reason to come here is for the Belgian beers--they have quite a few hard to find ones on tap. Their fries, I swear to god, are the best in Chicago: hand cut and with a consistently amazing aioli. Their mussels and fries dish is affordable and about as good as I've had anywhere in the country. I'd also argue that their tilapia sandwich with fries is, in fact, the best fried fish sandwich in the midwest and a steal at $10. If you plan to eat here or settle for a few drinks, make sure to arrive before 7:30--this place is no secret. Most weekend evenings you'll have difficulty finding a seat and may be left standing awkwardly for over an hour before scrambling for a freshly vacated booth.
