Unfortunately most of the other reviews are right on about the service... slow. But I have never run into an attitude-related issue with any of the waiters. In talking to the owner when they first opened (on a very busy saturday afternoon), he mentioned that the weekend crowds had overwhelmed them a bit. I've tried this place a few times for both breakfast and lunch crepes and always had wonderful meals. The ingredients are very fresh and they import all (or at least most) of the cheeses they use in the crepes (note: imported cheese... always better). What's nice is that you can mix and match anything on the menu and always substitute. Although, they have some wonderful suggestions on the menu, you can't really go wrong. Also, if you are a coffee drinker, try the turkish coffee!
