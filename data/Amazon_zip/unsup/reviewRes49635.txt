This place is great. My boyfriend and I were starving and really craved a good steak. I remembered I had bookmarked this place and were outrageously happy I had.  At first we were seated relatively close to the door which offered a small draft, but asked to move and found a cozy little seat. The lighting was just right and had had the same waitress that seated us, took our drinks, and served us. She was sweet, Columbian, and honest with her recommended. We ordered the seafood platter for an appetizer and it was really fresh and delicious. It was served with a mild and a hot salad/sauce called Chimichurri. It was AMAZING!!! Next came the steak. We got the Entrana, which was highly recommended. It was served on a hot plate and sizzled when it came out. It also came with a plantain, yucca, and a potato.  I can honestly say that the steak they served was the single most delicious hunk of meat I have ever had. SO amazing. I tried to eat the whole thing but just couldn't handle so much food. I wish I hadn't gotten the appetizer.  I will be back as soon as possible. They're BYOB, also, so I will bring my own wine! With two glasses of wine, 2 full dinners, and an appetizer for two, the bill was only $70 bucks. Worth every penny!!!
