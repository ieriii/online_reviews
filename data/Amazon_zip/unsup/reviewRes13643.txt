YUM! My parents were in town one weekend and I heard so many great things about Glenn's so we went for dinner and it was sooo great that we went for brunch the next morning. Fish was obviously ordered around the table (for dinner) and WOW...so yum and quite fresh-tasting. Also, I was a big fan of the decor and atmosphere...quaint and quirky would sum it up.
