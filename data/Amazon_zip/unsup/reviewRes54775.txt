I was getting together with some girlfriends for brunch and chose Meli. I would think twice about ever going there again! The two hostesses at the front could hardly crack a smile at the front door as they took my name and informed me there would be a 20 min wait. Once seated, we were greeted by a very friendly and sweet server. Somehow there was some miscommunication on my friend's order and she asked for a different omelet. The server told us it would be no problem and returned 5 min later to inform us that the manager told her we were going to be charged for the one we sent back in addition to the one we re-ordered. Are you serious? I could see if it was a top cut of steak - but we're talking 3 eggs and some veggies here!! Then we asked for some more butter and were told it would be an extra charge. What a joke... The food is good, but Management needs to go back to school for some entry-level customer service classes!
