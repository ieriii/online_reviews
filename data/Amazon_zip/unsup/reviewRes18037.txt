Hot and fresh churros on the go! They were absolutely covered in cinnamon and sugar and the chocolate made them even better. While I was waiting for them, I feel like I was able to see the vast majority of the menu pass me by being brought out to people dining in. Everything looked amazing and I will definitely be coming back to get a torta.
