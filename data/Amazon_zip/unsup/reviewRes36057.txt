Got there on a Sunday morning around 8:30 am and it was still half empty, so we didn't have to wait at all. That was good. The food is really really good. I got a chorizo skillet, my moms got a chicken omelet, and my dad got pancakes. Everything was delicious and portions are sizeable. Their smoothies are great too. I would say it's slightly on the expensive side of breakfast/brunch places, but worth it. With 500+ positive reviews and a spot on check please, there really isn't too much more to say, except Go, Now!
