The food here is really tasty, but it could be less so and I'd still give The Bad Apple a big thumbs up, strictly based on the beer list. Said list is extensive and exciting and, wonder of wonders, *reasonably priced*! When I can try a beer for $4.50, it encourages me to be adventurous (and when I picked a beer off the tap that I turned out not to like *at all* and no one at my table wanted it either, our server exchanged it for something that I liked much better, and took the one I hated off the bill. Now *that's* service.). They had some very interesting brews available (including two of my beloved sour ales) and the server was knowledgeable about the list. She was also friendly and very much on the ball when it came to keeping our glasses full, in spite of having a packed section, and was happy to offer us samples of the tap beers before we made our selections. And hey! Appropriate glassware for each beer--nifty! Since the yummy menu just about equals the delicious beer list, and the great service and atmosphere seem to be present whether I'm there for lunch, dinner, or late night drinks, I have to officially declare Bad Apple my new happy place.
