Besides the immediate rudeness from Justin the "doorman" as soon as we walked in the door, everything else at Gilt Bar was awesome. Farro, grape, feta, and almond salad, I and love and you. Gnocchi with pork belly, pillows of heaven and porky delight. The starter of the bread with balsamic and roasted garlic is a must. Cocktails were strong and delightful and came with a carafe on the side of the little extra that's left. A wonderful touch. Skip the cash only bar downstairs. If it wasn't cash only then I would say do it. Loved the signs on the way to the restroom. Made me chuckle and they were needed. Good for dinner or good for just drinks. A good Chicago spot worth a visit.
