Wow, maybe I am missing something here. I had the mushroom torta today and it was good but not stellar. Perhaps the meat sandwiches are better... The problem? The bread was too crusty, the sandwich and chips were too salty and the beverage that I received was WAY, WAY too small to even begin to quench my thirst. I also wish there were more vegetarian/seafood options. The one bright side to my meal: the scrumptious, delectable, finger-licking churro. Holy mother!
