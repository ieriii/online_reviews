First of all, I had ZERO expectations of this place upon my arrival. All I knew was that I was in a yuppy area, completely hungrified. My boyfriend suggested this place, as he used to be a regular. We went in on a Friday night around 8, and sat at the counter to avoid the wait. What a delight! If you are a party of two, PLEASE sit at the counter. It is uber fun and you get the priviledge of watching the chefs make your dish. It's almost mesmerizing. I ordered the Conchiglie Gorgonzola, which was SUPERB.  Bryan ordered the Linguine Pesto, which was also above average. I would say skip the Cheesy Garlic Bread unless you are starving - it's not really impressive.  The service was excellent, and the men behind the counter are sweet. The best part was - the bill. About twenty bucks for two entrees and an appetizer.  Bravo Pasta Bowl!
