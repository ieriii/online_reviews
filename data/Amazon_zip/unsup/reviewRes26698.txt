Seriously one of the worst meals I have ever had. I have no idea what the hype is about with this place. First of all, half of our party was 20 minutes late for a 7pm reservation. The half that was there was not seated, and then when the other half arrived, they said we had to wait until 8pm. At 8pm we were seated at a table that had been empty the entire time we sat at the bar. The staff was pretentious, as was the presentation of the food--a group of waiters came to the table, each with a plate, and they fanned around us setting them down one at a time, as if they were performing a synchronized swim. The food was minimal, and we all were dreaming of getting a burger at Portillo's on the way home. More attention was paid to the artful presentation of food--7" plates with a tiny bite or two of something in the bottom corner, and small dots of reductions fanning up the plate. The whipped oyster cream left a nasty taste in my mouth, as did the courses that had ash--yes, literal ash--sprinkled on them. Not sure why anyone would want those tastes lingering. I suppose this is a place foodies would like, but if you want to have a satisfying meal that's more about you than the chef and staff, go somewhere where good food is the draw. We paid $500 for this meal (w/only one glass of wine)--yes, that's right, $500!!! Crazy. Take your hard-earned money and buy a pair of killer shoes instead.
