Since my first visit, I've been back once for dinner and once for lunch. Dinner is fantastic, but the Gage also has an excellent lunch menu. I had the roasted woodland mushroom sandwich, which was absolutely delicious - it was a heaping portion of mushrooms, and I couldn't keep it all in the bun! All of the sandwiches are served with fries, but you can substitute a delicious side salad (served with gorgonzola). They are quite accommodating. Our service was a bit slow during lunch, but the manager and hostess were nice enough to come around to give us our refills and make sure we were okay for our party of 8. OH - and I met Dirk Flanigan at Gourmet Taste of Chicago, and he's awesome! He told me how to make the brie crisp potatoes because I was raving about them! I also suggested that he bring the Kona Kompachi back! :) Now I just need to go back for brunch...
