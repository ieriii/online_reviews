Beautiful lobby. The rest is a dump. The elevator should be in an amusement park. The rooms are nice, if you like lumpy beds, peeling wallpaper, caked on dust on the air vents, disgusting bathrooms, and zero customer service. If they were a hostel, I'd be more understanding. But this place purports to be a classy old hotel.  If you're a hobo looking for a flophouse, this might be for you. There are plenty of dumpsters nearby for any biscuit-spearing you might have on your itinerary. By all means, catch a cannonball to chi-town but mind the bone polishers. If you are a non-hobo, look elsewhere.
