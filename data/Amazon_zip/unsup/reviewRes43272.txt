The last time I went to Milk & Honey was the last time I will ever go to Milk & Honey. I ordered my usual, the granola, except I asked for the granola separate from the yogurt (like in two different bowls - not a difficult request to accommodate, in my opinion), as well as a side of milk. It may sound weird, but I like to have a little granola with yogurt and a little granola with milk.  Needless to say, it did not come out the way I asked. When I finally flagged down the hostess (after failing to get the attention of anyone behind the counter), she said "that's the way the granola comes, and if you want some milk, you can get it yourself." That is a direct quote. I was stunned. I should have walked out. No one has ever been so rude to me in a restaurant before. I promise you, I will never go back there again.  Milk & Honey, you suck. I'm getting fired up just thinking about it. I need to go smoke a bowl to calm myself down...
