We use to come here more often when we lived down the street. They do not take reservations and it is usually pretty packed on Friday and Saturday nights. The food is all pretty good, I've had their salmon sandwich, mac and cheese, chicken pot pie, fish and chips, pasta, and risotto (special). It was all very good...except the pasta was just ok. I also really like their spinach dip appetizer. Overall the atmosphere is pretty high in energy. It is very loud, but fun. I wouldn't suggest coming on a first date or anything because it is hard to hear the other person. Also sitting by the fireplace in the library sucks because its like sitting at an end table. Very uncomfortable, even with the large leather chairs.  I've never had a problem with service or the staff either. They are all very friendly and the service is pretty fast. I often see kids and families here as well, but I don't think I'd take my kids here.
