Don't let the three star rating fool you. The pizza is good...but there's something missing. I'm not quite sure why people say this is like, the best pizza ever eaten. Here's the skinny: I went during "lunch" [served until 5 PM] and hey, the pizza was a good size and a good price [$5.95 for one topping]. It took a while for me to order. I was so confused, but the waiter was awesome and told me that my combination of ingredients would taste like crap. So I got a red with Italian sausage and garlic with his approval. The girlfriend got a red with goat cheese, basil, and tomatoes. Both pizzas wound up tasting, well, like pizza. There wasn't any magic pixie dust that made it taste amazing. In addition to the pizzas, we ordered the spinach and tomato dip. I thought it was pretty tasty, but pretty salty. Piece is definitely worth a visit. It's got some pizza that tastes like pizza, awesome service, and a nice home-y feel (not like "in the hood"-home-y). Plus they've got karaoke. You can't go wrong with pizza, beer, and karaoke. You just can't.
