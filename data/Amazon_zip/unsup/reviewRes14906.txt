Coming here is like going to visit your Cuban Grandma, and she makes you a heaping plate of delicious food! We had lechon, plantains, rice, and black beans, all of it tasty. We scarfed it down. We were there mid afternoon, and there was a steady stream of people, so they are getting to know this place! The Cuban music in the background sets the mood, as well as the Cuban newspapers from back in the day pasted all over the walls. I plan to come back for breakfast, because the pastries looked good, and the coffees were priced fairly. Lots of interesting stuff here to discover.
