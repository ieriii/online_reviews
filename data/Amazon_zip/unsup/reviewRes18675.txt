Hard to say anything here that hasnt already been said... Its a great litte (tiny) italian spot, only been there once, but the food, service, timing and ambience all worked. I had tried to come here with my wife on a saturday and couldn't find anywhere to park and it looked crowded from the outside so we gave up. Incidentally, we passed our ex-gov as he walked into the cuban place next door. I need to check that one out sometime. Anyway, this time around we made reservations and went on a wednesday. We brought a bottle of wine and it was promptly opened for us and glassed provided. They brought out bread with parmesan, oil, and crushed red pepper to go with. I had the linguini all' arrabbiata. Green and red peppers, onion, eggplant. It was spicy, and I could hardly finish it all (entirely a good thing). My wife had risotto gamberi which is shrimp and garlic. Highly recommend that one. The pace of ordering, getting appetizers, then the meal, seemed measured but natural. I like that extra touch -don't feel rushed nor abandoned. We were stuffed by the end and declined desserts. Its not cheap but I'm going back when the next special occasion comes around.
