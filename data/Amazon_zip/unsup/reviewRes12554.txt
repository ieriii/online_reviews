A friend of mine and I stopped here for dinner on a Thursday before seeing a play nearby. He had passed by it a lot on his way to work and always wanted to stop in. Unfortunately for him, he's a vegetarian and there is only one entree on the menu that does not include meat. In fact, most of the entrees are principally a slab of meat. We were a little rushed for time too so when he opted to make a dinner out of two of the appetizers, I quickly followed suit. My coconut shrimp and his quesadillas were amazing, but the jalapeo mashed potatoes and asparagus with serrano were forgettable. And let's be honest, Yelpers: with entrees all approaching or over 20 dollars, add on an 8 dollar glass of wine or cocktail, this place is definitely going to hit the $$$ range. All that said, I could very easily see myself coming back here with more time, more cash and less omnivorous guilt and having myself a better experience and upping my rating. The bar area in front is very cute and it'd be a great place to just stop in for a glass of wine, too.
