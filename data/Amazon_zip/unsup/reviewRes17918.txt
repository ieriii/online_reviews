I came here on a Friday night and was pleasantly surprised that our group of 4 +1 child was able to get seated within 15 mins. Street parking is also easy in this area. You can pay for a meter or there are some parts where you don't have to pay for parking at all! The service was excellent, which is why I gave the place a 4 stars. It seems like good service is hard to come by these days. For starters, we ordered the cheese curds. They are not the typical cheese curds you would like of. The batter they use is light and fluffy and the cheese curds are not individual pieces. They are lumped together into gooey cheese clusters. SOOO GOOD! The burgers itself were very good. We ordered the frenchie, slow burn, and over the lamb. The food comes out fairly fast. I think everyone enjoyed their burgers. I liked mine because of the brie. The slow burn could be more spicier though. The fries, however, was a bit overwhelming. My friends got the truffle fries and the boyfriend ordered the creole. Both were good. I think my friend commented that the truffle fries were too salty for her, but it was perfect in my opinion. I ordered the garlic fries. They use fresh garlic and really load it up. It was just too spicy for me. I don't think their burgers stood out over other burger places in the city, like lockdown, j. wellingtons, etc. Don't get me wrong, it was definitely good and worth going back. OVERALL: Food is 3 stars. Service made it a 4 star. :)
