I had dinner at Ruth's Chris for Restaurant Week. Let me start by saying that it's a great deal for Restaurant Week. I started with the house salad. It was fine. Nothing to write home about. For dinner, I ordered the 8 oz. filet. I asked for medium, but a couple bites in, I realized it was medium-well to well-done. I sent it back and within 2 minutes, I had a brand new, medium steak. Much better. The steak was good, but not great. It was pretty standard filet. I got mashed potatoes on the side, and they were delicious. For dessert, I got a chocolate mousse with custard and berries. It was very good. The ambiance and service were both fine. Again, not outstanding, but not bad either. While Ruth's Chris is good, there is definitely better steak to be had in Chicago. It's a-ok.
