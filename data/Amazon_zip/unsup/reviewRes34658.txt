Been here a couple of times and haven't been blown away by their food either time. I'm not saying it's not good, just doesn't live up to the precedent set by Pita Inn for me and Lebanese food. I really like their hummos, very creamy. The falafel are only ok, wish they made them in smaller batches so they didn't sit so long under the warming lamp. The chicken schwarma is the best of the meat options I've tried, a little spicy and well seasoned, they are just so much better when they are super fresh and piping hot. The meat pie is by far the best thing I've tried here, it's almost like a Mediterranean calzone, make sire you try one when you're here. Sultan's tahini is extremely different then any other I've tried and I can't ever decide if I love it or hate it, seems like it varies by bite with me.  I recommend sticking with the curry rice unless you absolutely love lentils, to me it's not a great combo.
