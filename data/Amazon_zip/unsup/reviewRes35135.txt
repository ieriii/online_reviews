Eating Crab Legs is like having sex with an exceptionally beautiful woman. No matter what, it's awesome and nice to tell your friends. Even if she's not moving or even crying, you'll look down and think, "This is fancy, Wish I did this way more often. The fellas will be certainly impressed." And with the crab legs (at the restaurant) i can't complain since how often am i going to eat crab legs. Only slightly more often than I hook up with a super beautiful woman. They were fresh and pretty delicious, otherwise there was good bread, spot on service, and a bathroom without a creepy attendant who doesn't trust me to turn on the faucet.  The only thing is that they've got a busy in/out lunch area on the side of the restaurant but in the restaurant itself it was pretty empty and that's a spooky ambiance. It was a work lunch, so I was eating with people i absolutely hate and I still had a great time. They had the lobster roll and fish tacos and said they were delicious. That's unfortunate because I was hoping there would be poison in there. Maybe I'll have to take them to Chinatown next time.
