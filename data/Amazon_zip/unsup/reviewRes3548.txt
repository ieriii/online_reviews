Food was probably one of the best wings I ever had. I also ordered the baby Buddha which was also awesome with a fried egg but they don't make the eggs fresh, there cold and don't run which I was hopping for. I asked them to make me another egg but they said that's how they come. Either way all the food was delicious. I would've gave 5 stars but the parking is horrible and getting a seat to eat is a bit of a challenge.
