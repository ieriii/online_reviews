This is a great italian restaurant! It was extremely easy to get a reservation on a saturday night yet the restaurant was packed! They've got a great coupon floating around that's $59 for a four course dinner for 2, including a bottle of wine so keep your eye open for that. Their bruschetta is really good and I had a pasta special that night which was pumpkin filled ravioli with butternut squash, it was awesome!  Their panna cotta is really good as dessert too. The service is great as well! I will definitely go back here.
