I can't help it if I don't know directions, don't understand street signs, nor even how to read a map. I did have a valid excuse for cabbing it to Yolk, though.. I really do. Tourist. yes, damn tourist.  It was rainy, I was hungry, and I was moody because I was hungry.. a friend and I were trying to get to Yolk but with my non-existent skills the cab was the best answer.  I love eggs and I can eat it anytime of the day. But, I'm a bit of a health freak (so no yolks). Yolk had all the best combos no extra cost for egg whites only & fruit sub (instead of potatoes). healthy options, and giant sized hearty pancakes. The omelette's came out quicker than and larger than expected. The food was decent priced, tasted good, large portions, AND the coffee was good and what's best is that it kept getting re-filled.  We need one of these places in San Francisco!
