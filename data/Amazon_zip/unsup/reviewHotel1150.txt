We stayed here for 3 evenings in December, and it was an amazing experience. Our room was gorgeous, and the bathroom superior to any other hotel I've stayed in I think. Our friends down the hall did find the layout of their room a little strange - the bed was more in the middle in front of a faux wall, and they didn't like that. (but since this is my review and not theirs, I'm sticking with 5 stars). We splurged and stayed on the gold floor - and so glad we did. It was well worth the extra cost....I have stayed on other "executive lounge" or "gold" floors at other hotels, and I'd say this was the best to date. The food is more than enough for breakfast so you don't need to eat elsewhere...and the snacks the rest of the day would tide us over until we went out for dinner. The staff in the lounge were very helpful! We all got a massage one morning, and it was an excellent experience. They could only fit 3 of us in, so they said they'd try to call some staff and see if they could call someone in, and they managed to squeeze the fourth one of us in! That's service - considering we didn't try to book it until the night before, and it's the weekend before Christmas. Will definitely stay here again, next time in Chicago.
