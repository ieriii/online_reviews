i came here a few weeks ago with 2 girlfriends. my first piece of advice: go in even numbers. we waited almost an hour to get in because at violet hour, they seat you at tables, no one is admitted into the bar to stand; you must wait for a table to become available. unfortunately for us, most tables are for 2 or 4 people and thus we waited much longer than people behind us. we ended up sitting at the bar. at first annoyed by this, i found it to be great because of the attentiveness of the bartenders. it was interesting to see them make all of their unique drinks and explain to you what the ingredients were; these ranged from egg whites to orange rinds to blackberries.  we ordered a punch bowl which was very cost effective, and also effective in giving me a sufficient buzz after only 2 drinks [i'm NOT a lightweight typically, these are just well made drinks!]. though it is definitely pricey, the quality of the drinks seemed to be worthwhile. i really enjoyed the atmosphere of the bar: extremely classy with dim lighting, rich curtains, and high back chairs. this is a perfect place for a date or to converse with a group of friends as you can actually hear. there are several rules in place to avoid annoying debauchery, but i appreciated these as it ensured our low-key night. i will definitely return, but will hope for a shorter wait time. going earlier in the evening may be advisable.
