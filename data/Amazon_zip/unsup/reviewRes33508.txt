I previously wrote this review: """OKAy - LET ME FIRST SAY, I HAVE YET TO TRY THIS PLACE.......I know I know, then why in the world am I writing a review. BUT BUT BUT, I have heard fantastic things about this "joint." The pancakes are amazing and the decor is very suiting. I actually read about this place in "DINING OUT MAGAZINE." Which btw is an excellent resource for great dining experiences. I hope to try it real soon, despite the fact that it is located in an area I LEAST associate with fine dining, and atmosphere.""" LET ME JUST SAY - I finally got around to trying YOLK after hearing several rave reviews. I figured, since I was sending people there on a regular basis, I should atleast try the joint. Sadly, it was way over rated. The prices are exorbitant and give new meaning to "silver dollar pancakes." More like GOLD BAR FLAP JACKS. Save some money and check out The Original Pancake House in Gold Coast. It may be $$$ too but at least you'll get your money's worth.
