Ok.. So I like pho.. This place offers pho with huge portion and yet cheap price. The soup is amazing. It's so tasty. My fave is chicken pho with beef broth. Put a bit of lemon juice and its yummmmmmmmmy. The shrimp pancake appetizer is HUGE! If you don't want to eat pho, I suggest you order this pancake. Its crunchy with lots of shrimp and vegetable. The only thing that I don't like about this place is the service. The servers are not that friendly, they look like they want to kick you out of the restaurant. Well, probably because this place is so crowded (especially during lunch time on sunday). I will definitely go back to this restaurant. (SOON!)
