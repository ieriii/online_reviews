What a horrible place!! Going there was a very upsetting experience was there with a friend upstairs in the open air bar for two hours early afternoon seated at a sofa no service had to get our drinks was not that busy.. a friend was coming to join us would not let them upstairs with empty seats every where nasty manager rude rude I eat out often and entertain will never go back.. this address has been home to several resturants over the years all have closed. I had dinner when it first openend food was so so.. sSalad bar was nasty people saw people taking food from the salad bar with their hands .. The salad bar needs to be monitored.. Food at the table was over cooked and cold need I say more..
