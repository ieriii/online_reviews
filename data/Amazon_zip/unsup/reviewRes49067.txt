I've been to The Publican twice now. The first time I left underwhelmed by the place, but after the second time I can say I'm a fan. My advice to people is to stay away from the fish and the chicken here and just indulge yourselves on the beef and pork (I guess this should be a no-brainer seeing as the walls are decorated with huge pigs). The beer menu is extensive and difficult to choose from, but they usually have a resident beer expert that can explain things to you. Country ribs and the bollito misto were popular at my side of the table. The pork rinds, however, were a huge disappointment. I have no idea how Esquire named them a top 10 food in the country. They wouldn't even make my top 100. I guess for $5 they're worth trying though...they're pretty good as far as pork rinds go. By the way, both times I've been here I've had reservations and haven't been seated till an hour after. The atmosphere of the place and the free appetizers they've given us both times have made that passable though.
