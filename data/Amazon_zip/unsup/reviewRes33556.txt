writing a review for sultan's market is like writing a review for air... like, doesn't everyone know how awesome it is? and isn't it, like, a part of everyone's life? how can you live without it? you can't! (see what i did there?) well, whatever, sultans market rules. their salad bar is ridiculous - so many fresh and tasty toppings and big ole' pieces of feta cheese, grape leaves, chicken, olives, oh my god, and you load up all of this deliciousness and get a good sized salad for under $5, or under if you play your cards right (hint: grape leaves are heavy.) their falafel is so perfect, and you can get a sandwich for $4 out the door. BOOM BAM, LUNCH. the only kind of bummer is that it's cash only but like, who the hell cares. if you don't have a few dolla bills in your wallet and some change then you probably shouldn't be eating anyway. if you haven't been here, you'll go and be like "wow, this is going to be a part of my life now, just like how air is."
