I've been here twice so far. The first time was average and not that impressive. I came back with a few friends a few weeks ago to figure out what we all wanted to do for the night and grab food. The food was what I was the most impressed with. The food to me was amazing. My three friends and myself all had three separate things and split the popcorn, and all of us were blown away. This is definitely not a place to spend an entire night, but I would highly recommend it for grabbing some food, and starting out your night with a few beers before heading some place else. The waitstaff were pretty nice as well, though they weren't too busy at the time.
