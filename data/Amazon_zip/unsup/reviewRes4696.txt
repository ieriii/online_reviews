I went here last night with my boyfriend (who was against tapas until last night- he prefers 'full' meals). We arrived around 6:30 and had a 45 minute wait- not surprised at all, but they did have a cocktail server walking around so you could have a drink while you waited. When we were finally seated we ordered: - chorizo stuffed olives - fresh spring peas with bacon & spearmint - meatball sliders - milk-braised pork shoulder with mashed potatoes All of them were ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS (especially the fresh spring peas, I'm still dreaming about that one!). I could've done without the olives, though. They were good, but not as on-par as everything else. While the food was delicious & the atmosphere was nice, the service was what turned us off. We had to wait about 5 minutes before our waitress came to the table and when she finally did she didn't offer any suggestions, ask us if it was our first time, etc - but she did that with all other tables surrounding us. Then when she realized we weren't ordering any alcohol our service completely went down. During our whole time there, she came to our table 4 times. 1) to place the order 2) to refill our sodas (she didn't even bring them out to us) 3) to give us our check 4) to return our card It wouldn't have been so terrible except we both wanted refills on our soda and she walked by 3 times- looking at the table, mind you- and she didn't do anything. I will most likely be back to try more things, but if you're coming here- don't expect the best service for the price you're paying!
