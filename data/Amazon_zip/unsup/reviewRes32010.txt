Sunda is by far one of my favorite restaurants in all of Chicago. I've been a couple times now and each time gets better.  The last time I was there I got the Honey-Ginger Braised Beef Longribs and they were amazing. The meat was so tender that there was no need for a knife and words cannot describe the delicious sauce/seasoning.  I also highly recommend the garlic noodles (blue crab style) as a starter for the table. You won't regret it.  Great spot for a business dinner, date or night out with friends. Also check out the happy hour for half price appetizers and great drinks from 5-7 p.m. every day.
