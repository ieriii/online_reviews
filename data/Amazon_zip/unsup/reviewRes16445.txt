I thought I reviewed this place. Well this was a hotspot for me in college. I knew some people who worked here so I would get some complimentary guacamole. Loved their raspberry mojitos! Started with some arepas as well.  On one occasion (during restaurant week) we came here for a family birthday. My dad ordered this huge piece of meat with the bone sticking out of it. My mom compared it to Fred Flinstone's piece of meat.  For a man that eats solely in Greektown when dining out, and complains about every modern food restaurant we bring him to, he loved every last bite of that gargantuan piece of meat.  The bright colors in the dining room and bathrooms are different, but kind of old to me now. The dining room is magnificently tall and overall it is a fun place to drink and eat.
